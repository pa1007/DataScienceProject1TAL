It is located on Jameson Land and serves the town of Ittoqqortoormiit, approximately 40 km (25 mi) to the south-east. The airport can serve STOL aircraft. An AS 350 helicopter of Air Greenland is permanently housed at the airport, linking it with Ittoqqortoormiit Heliport. The helicopter also provides search and rescue capabilities within the surrounding area, and can be chartered for transport.

It was sold to Greenland in 1990.In summer 2004 the airport was the destination of an arctic trip by two German microlight pilots flying a Flight Design CT2K light aircraft.The airport may be relocated to a new site on Liverpool Land closer to Ittoqqortoormiit, between the settlement and Uunarteq cape (Danish: Kap Tobin) to the south, thus eliminating the need for helicopter transfers.\n\n\n== Operations ==\nThe airport has around 15 employees, who have their home within the airport area. No other settlement is reachable by road, making the airport possibly the one with smallest population reachable by road in the world. There is a road to a seaport around 2 km south of the terminal building, and some other roads in the area. Transportation to the main settlement in the area (Ittoqqortoormiit) is by helicopter or (in the summer) by boat.\nThe airport acts as stopping off point for a number of expeditions into Jameson Land and Northeast Greenland National Park.

It is used by the Aerospace Engineering department of IIT Kanpur. Pawan Hans began a helicopter ferry service to Lucknow from June 2013, which later shut down silently.\n\n\n== History ==\nIIT Kanpur received collaborative technical assistance from a consortium of nine leading US universities when it was being set up. Considering the intense research potentials and rapid growth in the field of aviation at that time, it was decided to establish the faculty of Aeronautical Engineering at IIT Kanpur. Under the USAID educational assistance project, an all-weather 884x61 m small airstrip was set up with a Flight Laboratory. The Lab was equipped with Piper PA-18 and Cessna 182 powered aircraft and Schweizer 2-22 and Schweizer 1-26 gliders. A Rohini glider, designed and developed at Technical Center of Civil Aviation Department and manufactured at HAL, was the jewel in the crown of the Flight Lab. The open cockpit, side-by-side seating, fabric covered wooden structure glider became very popular among students and used extensively for research work. Soon the Flight Lab. swung into action and the gliders were aero-towed to desired heights with students on board for the complex studies of aerodynamics and flight mechanics.\nThe glider flying programme was an instant hit with the students of IIT Kanpur. Due to the massive response, membership was restricted to a number of selected students. You could see them beeline for the Center immediately after their classes. The intense heat of summer or the extreme cold of winter could not deter them from that one more flight. The excitement of positive- and negative- 'G's, long soaring flights or a first solo provided a special thrill and were keenly awaited. Soaring flights of over five hours and altitudes over 10,000 feet became common events. Many students who were unable to become members became frequent visitors for joyrides. The campus residents were not to be left far behind, and visited the Centre with family and friends to lose the feel of being earth-bound.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of airports by ICAO code: V#VA VE VI VO - India\nList of airports in India\nIIT Kanpur#Laboratories and other facilities\nKanpur Airport\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nGliding Club, IIT Kanpur", "infobox": {"name": "Flight Laboratory, IIT Kanpur", "image": "Kalyanpur airport.jpg", "type": "Private", "owner": "[[IIT Kanpur]]", "location": "[[IIT Kanpur]] campus, [[Kalianpur|Kalyanpur]], [[Kanpur]], [[India]]", "metric-elev": "yes", "coordinates": "{{coord|26|31|14|N|080|13|51|E|region:IN|display|=|inline,title}}", "pushpin_map": "India", "pushpin_mapsize": "250", "pushpin_map_caption": "Location of IIT Kanpur Airfield", "pushpin_label": "IIT Kanpur", "pushpin_label_position": "left", "website": "https://www.iitk.ac.in/aero/flight-laboratory", "metric-rwy": "yes", "r1-number": "09/27", "r1-length-f": "3500", "r1-length-m": "1000", "r1-surface": "[[Asphalt]]"}, "wikidata": {"instance of (P31)": "airport (Q1248784)", "coordinate location (P625)": {"latitude": 26.83333333, "longitude": 80.41666667, "altitude": null, "precision": 0.016666666666667, "globe": "http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q2"}, "country (P17)": "India (Q668)", "located in the administrative territorial entity (P131)": "Kalyanpur, Uttar Pradesh (Q6355006)", "Freebase ID (P646)": "/m/0bm94gg"}, "cat": "Airports", "url": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_Laboratory,_IIT_Kanpur", "wikibase": "Q3084726"}, {"name": "Iginniarfik Heliport", "url_name": "26587040", "txt": "Iginniarfik Heliport (ICAO: BGIG) is a heliport in Iginniarfik, a village in the Qeqertalik municipality in western Greenland.

That night Aarif was killed by police after he set fire to their station. After hearing of his friend's death, Bilal would forever be changed. Though he sympathized with the protesters, he found faults on both sides and decided to take a cue from Batman's origins: becoming a symbol, without racial or religious bias, that could make a difference for what's right and just.

Created by E. C. Segar in 1936, the character is Popeye's father, who is between the ages of 85 and 99.\n\n\n== History ==\nPappy first appeared in Thimble Theatre not long after Popeye acquired Eugene the Jeep in 1936. Popeye decided to use the creature's supernatural knowledge to find his father. An expedition which included Toar the caveman and Olive Oyl was set up to go to Barnacle Island. The ungrateful father answered Popeye's greeting with, \"You look like something the cat dragged in... I don't like relatives.\" He came to Popeye's home anyway, followed by some mermaids with whom he had flirted.\nPoopdeck Pappy made his first animated appearance in the Popeye the Sailor short Goonland (1938). In this cartoon, it is revealed that Popeye has a long-lost father, not seen since infancy, who is being held captive in the bizarre realm of Goon Island. When he goes to rescue the \"ol' goat\" in the Goon prison, his father refuses to acknowledge Popeye as his son, but when Popeye is himself captured by the Goons, Pappy eats Popeye's mislaid can of spinach to rescue his only child. In the m\u00eal\u00e9e that ensues, the filmstrip is supposedly broken and the projectionist must safety pin it back together to finish the cartoon.\nPopeye is the spitting image of Poopdeck Pappy, though Pappy has a white beard. Pappy is far less principled than his son, stealing from Popeye's bank account and trying to sell water for $5,000 in Death Valley. (To which, Popeye, while pouring water to the parched traveler, tells Poopdeck, \"I yam disgustipated wit' ya!\") There is no love lost between him and Olive Oyl, whom he calls a \"lath-legged bean pole.\" (This stemmed from Poopdeck slugging Olive when they first met.) However, while he is grumpy and somewhat hostile, he is quite protective of Popeye, and does have a hidden soft side.\nAfter Segar's death, Poopdeck's mother (called Granny who looks like her son and grandson, but wearing a bonnet) was introduced into the strip. She refuses to treat her son as an \"eighty-five-year-old adult\" (his age has been reduced from 99 to 85 in the comic strip) and often disciplines him after his raucous \"nights on the town\". She tends to be more amiable to Popeye, although she too believes that Olive needs a bit more meat on her bones. However, Olive agrees with how Granny keeps Pappy in the house, because when she does, the town is able to get a sound sleep. Granny is also notorious as being one of the worst cooks in the world.\nIn the Fleischer Studios shorts, both Poopdeck Pappy and Popeye were both voiced by Jack Mercer.\n\n\n== Appearances ==\nGoonland (1938)\nGhosks in the Bunk (1939)\nStealin' Ain't Honest (1940)\nFightin' Pals (1940)\nMy Pop, My Pop (1940)\nPoopdeck Pappy (1940)\nProblem Pappy (1941)\nQuiet Pleeze (1941)\nChild Psykolojiky (1941)\nPest Pilot (1941)\nSeein' Red White N' Blue (1943)\nOlive Oyl For President (1948)\nPopeyes Pappy (1952)\nAncient Fistory (1953)\nBaby Wants a Battle (1953)\nTaxi-Turvy (1954)\nBride and Gloom (1954)\nNearlyweds (1957)In Robert Altman's Popeye, Poopdeck Pappy is played by Ray Walston. He is the \"Commodore\" of Sweethaven, but gets kidnapped by Captain Bluto and must be saved by Popeye. When Popeye sees his bulging arms, \"squinky\" eye and his pipe, he recognizes his long-lost father\u2014though, as in their meeting on Goon Island, Pappy initially refuses to accept that Popeye is his son.\nHe also appears in Popeye and Son, in \"Poopdeck Pappy and the Family Tree\". While he comes to help his grandson Junior with his school report, traces of the classic Pappy come shining through when describing their ancestors in greater unsavory detail (much to Junior's initial dismay).\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nPopeye | The Home of Popeye the Sailor Man", "infobox": {"colour": "#DEDEE2", "name": "Poopdeck Pappy", "series": "[[Popeye (comic strip)|Popeye]]", "image": "Popeye finds Poopdeck Pappy 1936.jpg", "image_size": "250px", "caption": "Popeye finds his father, Poopdeck Pappy, 1936.", "creator": "[[E.

The character first appeared in The Eternals #9 (March 1977), and was created by Jack Kirby. Although physically a child, Sprite is an Eternal, a member of an ancient and extremely powerful immortal race, who is commonly depicted as a mischievous trickster figure. Since 2019, Sprite has been depicted as alternatively male and female in comics (via the plot element of rebirth) due to their (then-unreleased) depiction as the latter in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU).Lia McHugh portrayed Sprite in the 2021 MCU film Eternals, with Hannah Dodd portraying Sprite's illusionary adult form of \"Sandra\", and Salma Hayek portraying Sprite disguised as Ajak.\n\n\n== Publication history ==\nSprite first appeared in The Eternals #9 (March 1977), and was created by Jack Kirby.\n\n\n== Fictional character biography ==\nSprite is an incorrigible trickster and practical joker, and has been for millennia. Claiming to have been the inspiration for William Shakespeare to write the character of Puck in A Midsummer Night's Dream and J. M. Barrie to write Peter Pan, Sprite revels in what he sees as \"playful\" behavior, he is unmindful of the often deadly consequences of his \"pranks\", especially to fragile \"mortal\" humans. Though punished time and again for his murderous actions, he always returns to his preferred way of life after a while.\nDuring the Fourth Host of the Celestials, when Zuras calls for the Uni-Mind to examine the Celestials' Mothership, Sprite remains behind with Domo's Central Processor. There, he convinces the imprisoned Forgotten Eternal to help stop an attack to the Celestial ship.While trying to improve Olympia's systems, Sprite accidentally sends Olympia into the Negative Zone once, but the Eternals are able to restore it to its proper place. Sprite later advocates the appointment of the Black Knight as Sersi's Gann Josin (sharing a mental bond) as compromise with Ikaris, who wants her killed.\n\n\n=== Reality change plan (Eternals Vol. 3) ===\nIn the Eternals miniseries by Neil Gaiman, Sprite, under the \"real name\" of Col\u00edn, was the star of \"It's Just So Sprite\", a sitcom on the Tweenie Channel. Although he presented himself to be unaware of his past or abilities, he also served as a spokesman for Hero Registration (as the series is set during the Civil War event).Ikaris, who seemed to be the only Eternal with any memory of his past, sees Sprite on television and informs Makkari that Sprite was another Eternal. Later, after Ikaris disappeared and the remaining Eternals started to recover their powers, Curry contacted Sprite, seeking advice. Sprite reveals that he had always known who they both were, and takes them to the Dreaming Celestial, their creator. There, Sprite informs Curry that it was Sprite himself who made all the Eternals forget who they were, took away their powers, and removed all record of them from reality, as revenge for a million years of them treating him like a child and not allowing him to experience the vices of the world \u2013 to the extent that they created him as the Eternal 'who would never grow up', trapped in the form of a prepubescent child. Using the Uni-Mind powered by the Dreaming Celestial, Sprite uses his powers to warp reality to his will, making himself a normal human male child, so that he can finally age and experience the vices of the world, including mating. Sprite and Makkari are subsequently attacked by Deviants, but Sprite escapes. Sprite was later seen boarding a train to run away from the problems he caused that led to the awakening of the Dreaming Celestial, and was ultimately found by Zuras. Sprite has no apologies for causing the current situation, and, satisfied with the life he lived, although promising vengeance, allows Zuras to kill him by snapping his neck.\n\n\n=== A new cycle (Eternals Vol. 5) ===\nFollowing the mass suicidal event that caused all Eternals to die after learning the truth of their origin, they were all reborn simultaneously due to their eternal (both species and longevity-wise) nature. Now resurrected in a female body with none of their memories intact, Sprite is taken in by Ikaris, traveling around New York, subduing Deviants. When they both came back from their trip to New York City, they were suspects in the murder of Zuras. Sprite and Ikaris tracked the murderer's trail to the ruined city of Titanos where they encountered the Mad Titan Thanos. Upon learning of their role in the events ultimately leading to the death of the Eternals and their own subsequent death at Zuras' hands, Sprite is intrigued.\n\n\n== Powers and abilities ==\nSprite, like all Eternals, has total control over his body's life force and molecular structure, making him virtually immortal; in addition to not aging, Eternals are immune to all known diseases and toxins, radiation, and extremes of temperature. His Eternal body has the appearance of a pre-adolescent child but he is, in fact, hundreds of thousands of years old.\nSprite is able to channel cosmic radiation into blasts of heat or force, levitate himself and others, and create illusions. He has superhuman strength, though because of his small size and childlike anatomy it is less than that of most Eternals. He is capable of rearranging atoms and molecules in such a way as to radically restructure objects (once creating a working ground-to-orbit spacecraft in seconds), and is second only to Sersi in the art of molecular reconstruction.\nSprite, in his former incarnation, successfully used the reality-warping powers of the Dreaming Celestial to provide himself with a human body that would have aged to adulthood normally, if not for his demise.\n\n\n== In other media ==\n\n\n=== Television ===\nSprite appears in Marvel Knights: Eternals, voiced by Sam Vincent.\n\n\n=== Film ===\nSprite appears in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) film Eternals (2021), portrayed by Lia McHugh. She is the grandiose storyteller of the community of genetically-engineered Eternals; synthetic beings made out of cosmic energy by the Celestial Arishem. She appears as an adolescent girl and has been stuck looking like a child for over a millennium. Initially living with Sersi in England, the return of the Deviants prompts Sprite to join Ikaris and Sersi as they reconnect the rest of the Eternals to fight this threat. Sprite desires to return to the Eternals home planet where she will no longer be treated like a child, so when Ikaris' betrayal is revealed she ultimately sides with Ikaris (whom she has long been in love with) against the other Eternals to ensure the birth of the Celestial Tiamut, thus completing their true mission. After attempting to kill Sersi, Sprite is knocked out by Druig and Sersi is able to form a Uni-Mind with the other Eternals and turn Tiamut to stone. Before relinquishing the Uni-Mind, Sprite asks Sersi to use the cosmic power to turn Sprite human, stripping her of her powers and immortality and allowing her to age into an adult. This also inadvertantly spares her from being summoned into space by a displeased Arishem along with the Eternals who remained on Earth (Sersi, Phastos and Kingo), who intends to observe their memories to see if humanity is worthy to live.\nHannah Dodd portrays Sprite in the illusionary adult form of \"Sandra\", which she uses to date adults without them thinking her to be a child.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nSprite (Eternal) on Marvel Database, a Marvel Comics wiki", "infobox": {"image": "Sprite (Marvel Comics).jpg", "character_name": "Sprite", "species": "[[Eternals (comics)|Eternals]]", "full_name": "Sprite", "publisher": "[[Marvel Comics]]", "debut": "''[[Eternals (comics)|The Eternals]]'' #9 (March 1977)", "creators": "[[Jack Kirby]]", "alliances": "[[Eternals (comics)|Eternals]]<br>[[Deviant (comics)|Deviants]]", "aliases": "Puck<br />Robin Goodfellow<br />Col\u00edn<br />Peter Frickin' Pan", "powers": "Control over cosmic energy allowing energy blasts and invulnerability,<br />Immortality,<br />Vast psionic powers including telepathy, telekinesis, matter transmutation and illusion casting", "villain": "y"}, "wikidata": {"from narrative universe (P1080)": "Marvel Universe (Q931597)", "instance of (P31)": ["comics character (Q1114461)", "Eternals (Q1618814)"], "different from (P1889)": "Sprite (Q65937810)", "Freebase ID (P646)": "/m/0dy3tw"}, "cat": "Comics_characters", "url": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprite_(Eternal)", "wikibase": "Q3967283"}, {"name": "Mei", "url_name": "54357365", "txt": "Mei (Chinese: \u7f8e; pinyin: M\u011bi; or Chinese: \u5c0f\u7f8e; pinyin: Xi\u01ceo M\u011bi; lit. 'Little Mei' in Taiwan), full name Dr. Mei-Ling Zhou (simplified Chinese: \u5468\u7f8e\u7075; traditional Chinese: \u5468\u7f8e\u9748; pinyin: Zh\u014du M\u011bil\u00edng), is a fictional, playable character appearing in the 2016 video game Overwatch, a team-based first-person shooter developed by Blizzard Entertainment. Outside of Overwatch, Mei also appears in related media, as well as a playable character in the crossover multiplayer online battle arena game Heroes of the Storm. She is a Chinese climatologist and adventurer from Xi'an, China.\nMei is voiced by Chinese voice actress Yu \"Elise\" Zhang in both the English and Chinese language releases of Overwatch.\n\n\n== Development and design ==\nMei was first announced in October 2015 at BlizzCon; along with D.Va and Genji, she was one of the last heroes who was introduced into Overwatch prior to its official release. At the beginning, Blizzard wanted to design a hero who used frost to battle. At that time, the nationality of this hero was not decided yet, but the designers once thought to set the hero as a Canadian. Later, being impressed by the ice and snow sculptures of Harbin in China, the design team finally decided to set the hero as Chinese. Additionally, her initial design was more oriented towards being a bounty hunter named \"Frostbite\", using her ice and frost powers in order to trap prey. However, as they developed her art style, the team found inspiration in an image of a \"cute, nerdy scientist\" which they loved, as it gave the idea that normal everyday people could be inspired to be a hero and be part of the Overwatch team.One voice line of Mei's character was added into the game after being inadvertently inspired during a recording session by Zhang. Zhang had just flubbed one line and told Michael Chu, lead writer of Overwatch, and the recording engineer \"sorry, sorry, sorry.\" Chu believed this was a great line, and used it along with other new lines to have Mei be apologetic, both sincerely and sarcastically, for her actions in-game.\n\n\n== Gameplay ==\nMei wields an Endothermic Blaster that can either freeze enemies in place with a short-range ice beam or shoot a long-range icicle projectile. Mei can also use the Blaster to encase herself in a solid ice block that blocks damage and heals her injuries, as well as erect temporary walls of solid ice with many versatile uses, primarily for blocking the enemies. Her ultimate ability is Blizzard, which calls down her personal weather modification drone Snowball to freeze all enemies in a wide radius.Blizzard's designers have stated that for Overwatch 2, Mei's abilities will be altered to reflect the new gameplay style they want for the game. In particular, while Mei's ice beam will still slow and damage enemies, it will no longer freeze them in place.\n\n\n== Appearances ==\n\n\n=== Overwatch ===\nIn Overwatch, Mei was employed by Overwatch to find the cause for the planet's changing climate, which had been variously blamed on the industry, the increasing omnic population, and increased consumption of natural resources. While deployed at the \"Ecopoint\" Overwatch base in Antarctica, Mei and the other scientists there were trapped by a polar storm that damaged the facility. Lacking sufficient resources to wait for a rescue, they decided to enter cryostasis. Mei was the only survivor when she was found close to a decade later; by that time, Overwatch had disbanded, and all of the bases set up to monitor the climate crisis had stopped functioning. Mei elected to carry on the work alone, accompanied by Snowball.Mei is the main character of the Overwatch animated short \"Rise and Shine\", released during Blizzard's presentation at the August 2017 Gamescom. The short film is an expanded retelling of Mei's origin story.\n\n\n=== Heroes of the Storm ===\nMei was added as a playable character to the crossover multiplayer online battle arena game Heroes of the Storm in June 2020. Her character in Heroes maintains most of the same abilities as in Overwatch, though she is classified as a \"tank\" and has additional combat abilities.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nAs the first Chinese hero in Overwatch, Mei has garnered the interest of many players in China. Some players in China consider that Mei's background, combined with her pet phrase \"Our world is worth fighting for\", shows us a positive image of a female who determines to protect this world. Meanwhile, some other Chinese players question the design of Mei, because she wears a thick jacket and this makes her look not as slim as most of the other female heroes in Overwatch. Arnold Tsang, assistant art director of the game, clarified that Mei works in the polar regions and she has to wear thick clothes to keep warm.During Overwatch's 2016 holiday event, a new game mode centered on Mei was added, called \"Mei's Snowball Offensive\", with each player controlling Mei. Her ice shield and ice wall abilities were left unchanged, but her blaster was replaced with a single-shot snowball thrower that would be an instant kill if it hit an unshielded opponent. The blaster could be reloaded by finding a patch of snow that randomly appeared on the map. Mei's ultimate ability enabled her to fire the snowball blaster several times without reloading for a short period of time. In addition to this, Blizzard created a new Legendary (highest rarity) skin for Mei that could be awarded during this event, which included a reskinning of her ice block into a snowman. Players criticized this new skin for being considered as Legendary, commenting that it was only a recolor of her base skin with a hat puff, and tool. Jeff Kaplan acknowledged the complaints, stating \"We just sort of make a gut call based off of  [sic] what we think is cool. Coolness is very subjective, and based off of  [sic] the community reaction it seems like our gauge was off on this one.\"Prior to the launch of the 2021 Overwatch League season, a new skin for Mei was released based on a mixed martial arts (MMA) outfit, named \"MM-Mei\". The skin gave Mei cornrows, a hairstyle common to people of African descent, but also had been used by MMA Chinese fighter Zhang Weili among other non-African people. Players criticized the skin as cultural appropriation since there were other types of closely-braided hairstyles from MMA fighters Blizzard could have used instead, in addition to the fact that Overwatch had yet to feature a female character of African-descent where that hairstyle would be better suited.\n\n\n=== Use by Hong Kong protesters and supporters ===\n\nOn October 6, 2019, Blizzard suspended professional Hearthstone player Chung \"Blitzchung\" Ng Wai for making statements in support of the ongoing protests in Hong Kong during a Grandmasters livestream interview, with Blizzard asserting that Blitzchung had violated rules related to their behavior and respecting Blizzard's image. Blizzard's actions were criticized globally, and as part of the reactions, Hong Kong protesters and others began to illustrate Mei as a supporter of the protests as a show of solidarity against Blizzard's decision.\n\n\n== References ==", "infobox": {"name": "Mei", "image": "Mei Overwatch.png", "caption": "Mei and her personal weather modification drone, \"Snowball\"", "series": "[[Overwatch (video game)|Overwatch]]", "first": "[[BlizzCon]] 2015", "firstgame": "''[[Overwatch (video game)|Overwatch]]'' (2016)", "voice": "Yu \"Elise\" Zhang", "gender": "Female", "occupation": "Climatologist", "nationality": "Chinese"}, "wikidata": {"from narrative universe (P1080)": "Overwatch universe (Q56529315)", "languages spoken, written or signed (P1412)": ["English (Q1860)", "Chinese (Q7850)"], "present in work (P1441)": "Overwatch (Q18515944)", "voice actor (P725)": "Yu Zhang (Q24834819)", "occupation (P106)": ["climatologist (Q1113838)", "adventurer (Q2873500)"], "sex or gender (P21)": "female (Q6581072)", "instance of (P31)": ["video game character (Q1569167)", "fictional human (Q15632617)"], "given name (P735)": "Meiling (Q6810109)", "family name (P734)": "Zhou (Q845135)", "name in native language (P1559)": "\u5468\u7f8e\u7075", "part of (P361)": "characters of Overwatch (Q24877466)", "country of citizenship (P27)": "People's Republic of China (Q148)", "official website (P856)": "https://playoverwatch.com/en-us/heroes/mei/", "ethnic group (P172)": "Chinese people (Q6501380)", "bgm.tv character ID (P6296)": "43776", "Comic Vine ID (P5905)": "4005-137899", "Giant Bomb ID (P5247)": "3005-32386", "Fandom article ID (P6262)": ["overwatch:Mei", "cosplay:Mei"], "wears (P3828)": "anorak (Q567688)", "residence (P551)": "Xi'an (Q5826)", "hair color (P1884)": "brown hair (Q2367101)", "eye color (P1340)": "brown (Q17122705)", "image (P18)": "Montreal Comiccon 2016 - Mei (28181539841).jpg", "height (P2048)": {"amount": "+66", "unit": "http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q218593"}, "Quora topic ID (P3417)": "Mei-Overwatch", "media franchise (P8345)": "Overwatch (Q99569678)", "All the Tropes identifier (P8895)": "Overwatch/Characters#Mei", "TV Tropes identifier (P6839)": "Characters/OverwatchDamageJToP", "Google Knowledge Graph ID (P2671)": "/g/11c1g6s64v", "Behind The Voice Actors character ID (P5107)": "Overwatch/Mei"}, "cat": "Comics_characters", "url": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mei_(Overwatch)", "wikibase": "Q28410793"}, {"name": "Faiza Hussain", "url_name": "17464640", "txt": "Dr. Faiza Hussain, later given the codename Excalibur, is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Faiza was created by writer Paul Cornell, first penciled by Leonard Kirk. First appearing in Captain Britain and MI: 13 #1 (May 2008), Faiza Hussain is used as the title's \"point of view character\".\n\n\n== Characterization ==\nCornell has been aided in the development of this character by a panel of Muslim women: Mona Bayoumi, Safiya Sayed Baharun, Farida Patel, and Sohere Roked.Faiza Hussain, originally written in early scripts as \"Faisa\", is named after the former England cricket Captain Nasser Hussain and although she is a British Muslim character, creator Paul Cornell has stated he does not want Faiza to be a pillar for the entire British Muslim community:  \n\nI think superheroes are too prone to being standard bearers for whole communities.\nHe also did not want her to say anything religious until in a situation where an everyday religious person would and steered her away from the normal clich\u00e9s associated with Muslim characters.\n\n\n== Fictional character biography ==\nFaiza Hussain is the only daughter of a family of Pakistani heritage who live in Chelmsford in Essex. A London-based Muslim medical doctor, and British superhero fangirl, Faiza initially gets caught up in the Skrull's invasion as she is performing battlefield triage while the Skrull attack is going on around her. While tending to the wounded, alongside the Black Knight, Faiza Hussain is struck by a Skrull laser weapon, this weapon seemingly gives Faiza powers which she uses to help Black Knight fend off more Skrulls.After the defeat of the Skrulls, Faiza Hussain became the wielder of Excalibur, and joined MI:13 as Black Knight's steward. When Dracula attacked the United Kingdom he personally attacked Faiza's family, injuring her mother while kidnapping her father and sending forces to attack the members of MI:13. In the aftermath of the attack, Pete Wisdom deduced that attack's aim was to keep Faiza (and Excalibur) out of the battle. He gives Faiza the codename \"Excalibur\" because he wants Dracula and his forces to hear and know that the mythical blade is still an active part of MI:13.During the Secret Empire storyline, Faiza appears as a member of the Champions of Europe alongside Ares, Captain Britain, Guillotine, Outlaw, and Peregrine. Alongside Squirrel Girl and Enigma,\nthe Champions free Paris, France from a Hydra invasion force.\n\n\n== Powers and abilities ==\nFaiza Hussain is a trained doctor, and appears to have a wide knowledge of the superhuman population. Although being an unpowered character in the first issue, Paul Cornell stated Faiza's power(s) would manifest during the first few issues of Captain Britain and MI:13. In issue 2 this came to pass, when Faiza Hussain showed an extreme level of control over biological organisms; she was able to disassemble a human body into its component parts while keeping the subject alive and stopped a horde of Skrulls by stopping their bodies from being able to move. She is seen to use these powers not only on living organisms, but also on other kinds of materials (like Black Knight's clothes). The extent and classification of these powers are yet to be revealed, but Black Knight described them as purely defensive.In a Q&A Cornell outlined her powers:\n\nShe can safely open up a body, see what's wrong with it, and sort it out on a subatomic level. This has the incidental effect of halting shape-changers like Skrulls in their tracks (and anyone else who knows what's good for them). She has trouble doing this to magic beings.\nFaiza's control over biological organisms does not work on any character or being infused with magic.\nShe also wields the sword Excalibur.\n\n\n== Other versions ==\nIn the Age of Ultron crossover, Faiza Hussain briefly adopts the mantle of Captain Britain from Brian Braddock in case he would die battling Ultron.This version of the character returns in the  two-part Secret Wars tie-in, Captain Britain and the Mighty Defenders. While she refers to herself as Captain Britain, she has no memory of what, where, or who \"Britain\" is due to the recent destruction of the Multiverse.\n\n\n== In other media ==\n\n\n=== Video games ===\nFaiza appears in the Facebook game Marvel: Avengers Alliance as a playable character.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==", "infobox": {"character_name": "Faiza Hussain", "image": "Faiza Hussain - Captain Britain and MI13.jpg", "caption": "Faiza Hussain, holding [[Excalibur]].<br>Art by [[Bryan Hitch]].", "publisher": "[[Marvel Comics]]", "debut": "''Captain Britain and MI: 13'' #1 (May 15, 2008)", "creators": "[[Paul Cornell]]<br>[[Leonard Kirk]]", "alter_ego": "Faiza Hussain", "species": "[[Human]]", "alliances": "[[MI-13 (comics)|MI-13]]<br>Champions of Europe<br>Mighty Medics", "partners": "[[Black Knight (Dane Whitman)]]", "aliases": "Excalibur", "powers": "Trained doctor<br>Control over living organisms to an unknown extent<br>Wielder of the Excalibur Sword"}, "wikidata": {"instance of (P31)": "fictional human (Q15632617)", "from narrative universe (P1080)": "Marvel Universe (Q931597)", "sex or gender (P21)": "female (Q6581072)", "Freebase ID (P646)": "/m/04664dx"}, "cat": "Comics_characters", "url": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faiza_Hussain", "wikibase": "Q5431344"}, {"name": "Bluey and Curley", "url_name": "19616318", "txt": "Bluey and Curley is an Australian newspaper comic strip written by the Australian artist, caricaturist, and cartoonist Alex Gurney.Few original Bluey and Curley strips are held in public collections, because, throughout his lifetime, Alex Gurney was renowned for his generous habit of giving the original art work of his caricatures, cartoons, and comic strips to anyone who asked. Following Gurney's death in 1955, the strip was taken over by Norm Rice in early 1956, but he died in a vehicle accident that year. Bluey and Curley was then taken over by cartoonist Les Dixon who drew these characters for 18 years until he retired in 1975.\n\n\n== Characters ==\nThe first Bluey and Curley strip appeared soon after the start of World War II. It featured two Australian soldiers, Bluey (who had served in the First AIF), and Curley, a new recruit.\nBy the end of the war, they had served in every Australian campaign \u2014 in North Africa, in the Middle East, in New Guinea, in Northern Australia, and in the Pacific Islands \u2014 and, once the war was over, they even went to London and took part in the 1946 Victory Parade.\n\n   Bluey and Curley epitomised what was seen as the typical Australian soldier. They liked a drink, a gamble and a chat (in colourful Aussie slang of course), and they always had some scheme afoot. They had a healthy disregard for officers and regulations and were quick to bring down any mates who were getting too big for their boots. Despite their larrikin streak, they were fearless, resilient and skilled in battle.\n   Alex Gurney, the creator of Bluey & Curley, produced the strip from 1940 until his death in 1955. It was syndicated across Australia and appeared in New Zealand, New Guinea, and Canada (but was considered too Australian for American newspapers).\n\n\n== Creation ==\nBy 1939, Alex Gurney was already well established as a caricaturist, cartoonist, and comic strip artist.\nIn late 1939, following the outbreak of World War II, he created his most famous characters, Bluey and Curley, which first appeared in the Picture-News magazine.\nHe applied for the copyright registration of Bluey and Curley on 16 October 1939; and his application was granted on 9 November 1939 (Australian Copyright No.6921).\n\n\n== Syndication ==\nIt was transferred to The Sun News-Pictorial in 1940, from whence it was syndicated throughout Australia, New Zealand and Canada.\n\n\n== Cultural impact ==\nThe strip featured a pair of soldiers, \"Bluey\" (named for his red hair), the Great War veteran who had re-enlisted in the second A.I.F., and Curley (named for his extremely curly hair), the new recruit to the A.I.F.The strip was widely appreciated for the good-humoured way it depicted the Australian \"diggers\" and their \"mateship\", as well as for its realistic use of Australian idiom of the day.\n\n\n== Service life ==\nGurney visited army camps throughout Australia and New Guinea to ensure authenticity. While in New Guinea he contracted malaria and was incapacitated for some time.\n\n\n== Post-war life ==\nGurney was in England in June 1946, as part of an Australian Press Syndicate sent specifically to view the Victory Parade. As well as sending caricatures of various eminent people involved in that parade back to Australia for distribution through the press, he also used the opportunity to have Bluey and Curley attend the parade, and a number of his Bluey and Curley comic strips reflected that event.Gurney's visit to London, and his version of events, as seen through his Bluey and Curley comic strip, was also historically significant for another reason: it was the first time that a newspaper comic strip had ever been transmitted from England to Australia by radio.Although Bluey and Curley were popular with Australians because they related to the slang, attitude, and the lack of respect towards authority exhibited by the main characters, the strip lost some of its appeal and readership when the pair returned to \"civvy street\".\n\n\n== Gurney's death ==\nGurney died suddenly, of heart disease, on 4 December 1955. He had collapsed in his car parked outside his home. He was cremated with Anglican rites.\n\n\n== Post-Gurney ==\nThe strip was later drawn by Norman Howard Rice (1911\u20131956). Rice died as the result of a car accident on 31 December 1956 (New Year's Eve). The strip was then drawn by Les Dixon from 1957 until 1975.\n\n\n== Film ==\nThe comic was adapted into a TV film Mud, Bloody Mud in 1985.\n\n\n=== The Original ===\n\n\n== Footnotes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\nGurney, Margaret, My Dad: Alex Gurney 1902-1955, M.

C. Thomson & Co. It follows the sporting adventures of a heroic character named William Wilson. The stories were written by Gilbert Lawford Dalton and drawn by Jack Glass. The stories ran until 1984 in various British magazines.\n\n\n== Publication history ==\nThe character first appeared in issue 1029 Wizard (24 July 1943) in a story titled \"The Truth About Wilson\". The first adventure introduced Wilson as a supreme athlete, who joins a race from out of the crowd and manages to record a three-minute mile. The character's adventures were written by Gilbert Lawford Dalton using the pen name W S K Webb, and a book, The Truth About Wilson collected a number of the text stories in the 1960s. Thought by Paul Gravett to be the prototype of the \"astonishing sporting prodigies\" who became popular in British comics, (cf. Alf Tupper, Roy of the Rovers), Gravett describes him as an \"unassuming totally dedicated loner, [wanting] no glory or publicity\". Although his stories were initially told in prose, a move to the comic papers The Hornet and  Hotspur saw the character depicted in comic strip form. The character was later revived for D.C. Thomson's Spike comic of 1983 to 1984, initially within a comic strip with art by Neville Wilson.  Referred to as The Man in Black, the character was revealed to be Wilson in the course of the story, with reprints of the older material published within the comic as Wilson's diaries.\n\n\n== Fictional character biography ==\nWilliam Wilson was born in the village of Stayling in Yorkshire and claimed to be born on 1 November 1795. However a document dated 11 March 1774 listed him as \"clerk to the manor\". He was sufficiently old that when writing, he used an \"f\" instead of an \"s\". His farmer father died in middle age, leaving Wilson \u00a35,000. He studied medicine and biology in a number of countries around the world and determined not to die early as so many he knew had, he worked out a health and fitness regime and learned how to slow his heart right down, using a formula created by people who could live to over 200. He developed his will power and hardened his body by whole winters spent in the open. Squadron leader W. Wilson D.S.O., D.F.C. and bar, who had 25 victories to his name, was shot down during the Second World War and was officially listed as missing.\nThe character is depicted within stories as performing a number of improbable events. Wilson was seen in one strip becoming the first man to climb Everest, and another saw him captaining an England cricket team to The Ashes in Australia. Originally hailing from Yorkshire, and living in a cave on a diet of nuts and berries, Wilson exemplified British grit and the stiff upper lip.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nAccording to The Guardian he \"was hailed as a welcome wartime morale booster\", while The Telegraph remembers him as a \"focused and intense individual ... [with no] recorded instance of him smiling or cracking a joke.\" In 2004 artist John Reynolds acquired the licence to reproduce images of Wilson as large screen-print canvases. Former Guinness Book of Records deputy editor and athletics statistician, Ian Smith, cites the character as an inspiration, and he inspired many British athletes in their careers as well as Belgian cyclist Eddy Merckx. The character is still used in newspaper reports on sport as a cultural reference point.\n\n\n== Tributes ==\nComedian and actor Billy Connolly wore a black leotard on stage during the 1970s as a tribute to Wilson.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nGallagher, Brendan.

He is one of Tintin's best friends, a seafaring pipe-smoking Merchant Marine Captain.\nHaddock is initially depicted as a weak and alcoholic character under the control of his treacherous first mate Allan, who keeps him drunk and runs his freighter. He regains his command and his dignity, even rising to president of the Society of Sober Sailors (The Shooting Star), but never gives up his love for rum and whisky, especially Loch Lomond, until the final Tintin adventure, Tintin and the Picaros, when Professor Calculus 'cures' him of his taste for alcohol. In the adventure Secret of the Unicorn (and continuing in Red Rackham's Treasure) he and Tintin travel to find a pirate's treasure captured by his ancestor, Sir Francis Haddock (Fran\u00e7ois de Hadoque in French). With newfound wealth and regaining his ancestral home Marlinspike Hall, Captain Haddock becomes a socialite; riding a horse, wearing a monocle, and sitting in a theatre box seat (The Seven Crystal Balls).\nHe then evolves to become genuinely heroic, volunteering to sacrifice his life to save Tintin's own in the pivotal Tintin in Tibet. In later volumes he is clearly retired.\nThroughout it all, the Captain's coarse humanity and sarcasm act as a counterpoint to Tintin's often implausible heroism. He is always quick with a dry comment whenever the boy reporter gets too idealistic.\n\n\n== Character history ==\nUntil Haddock's introduction, Tintin's constantly positive, optimistic perspective was offset by his faithful companion Snowy. Before Haddock, Snowy was the source of all dry and cynical side-commentary for the series. Herg\u00e9, however, realised Haddock's potential as a foil to Tintin. After he brought Haddock into the series, the Captain took over the role of the cynic, relieving Snowy and establishing Captain Haddock as a permanent addition to the cast.Herg\u00e9 introduced Captain Haddock in The Crab with the Golden Claws as the whisky-sodden captain of the Karaboudjan, a merchant vessel used\u2014without Haddock's knowledge\u2014by his first mate Allan Thompson for smuggling drugs inside crab tins. Because of his alcoholism and temperamental nature, his character was weak and unstable, at times posing as great a hazard to Tintin as the villains of the piece. He was also short-tempered, given to emotional expletive-ridden outbursts, and capable of infuriating behaviour; at one point he even attacks Tintin when, while traversing the Moroccan desert, he has the sun-induced delusion that Tintin is a bottle of champagne. However, Haddock is a sincere figure in need of reform, and by the end of his first adventure Tintin has gained a loyal companion, albeit one still given to uttering the occasional \"expletive\". \nHerg\u00e9 also allowed himself more artistic expression through Haddock's features than with Tintin's, and with Haddock offering more range in dynamism, Herg\u00e9 found himself connecting with his stories less through Tintin over time. Michael Farr, author of Tintin: The Complete Companion (2001), notes: \"Whereas Herg\u00e9 kept Tintin's facial expressions to a bare minimum, Haddock's could be contorted with emotion. In Haddock, Herg\u00e9 had come up with his most inspired character since creating Tintin.\"\nSales of the volume in which Haddock was introduced indicated the character was well received. After a fairly serious role in The Shooting Star, where he has risen to become the President of the Society of Sober Sailors (replete with a cabin full of whisky), Haddock takes a more central role in the next adventure, split over two books, The Secret of the Unicorn and Red Rackham's Treasure\u2014indeed, his family history drives the plot. He discovers Marlinspike Hall, the chateau owned by his forebears, which during Unicorn is owned by the villainous Bird brothers. Upon locating the treasure, the newly wealthy Haddock retires to Marlinspike, where Nestor, the former butler of the Bird brothers, is reemployed as Haddock's own. Haddock attempts, to mixed success, to become more refined and posh in The Seven Crystal Balls. He does so by, among other things, attending the Opera, making greater use of Nestor, parting his hair and wearing formal dress (a running joke in the book is how he goes through about a dozen monocles after they keep breaking). This phase ends before the book is over, as Haddock's grief over the abduction of Professor Calculus causes him to abandon his attempts at being aristocratic, and return to his iconic \"old seadog\" way of dressing. This shows the persistent nature of his seafaring humility, and deep down, his undeniable dislike of the pretentious. \n\nHerg\u00e9 built the next adventure around Haddock, furnishing the character with his ancestral home of Marlinspike Hall. Harry Thompson, author of Tintin: Herg\u00e9 and his creation, writes that the introduction of this large and luxurious country house was \"to provide a suitable ancestral home for Tintin and himself to move into.\" To achieve this in terms of the plot, Herg\u00e9 also details Haddock's ancestry, something Thompson regards as distinctive: \"Haddock is the only regular character whose relatives turn up in the Tintin stories at all (if one discounts Jolyon Wagg and his dreadful family).\"As Haddock's role grew, Herg\u00e9 expanded his character, basing him upon aspects of friends, with his characteristic temper somewhat inspired by Tintin colourist E.P. Jacobs and his bluffness drawn from Tintin artist Bob de Moor. Harry Thompson has commented on how Herg\u00e9 utilised the character to inject humour into the plot, notably \"where Haddock plays the fool to smooth over a lengthy explanation.\"Captain Haddock is especially notable in The Red Sea Sharks, where his skillful captaining of the ship he and Tintin seize from Rastapopoulos allows them to survive until they are rescued, and is especially noble in the pivotal Tintin in Tibet, volunteering to sacrifice his life to save Tintin's own. By the time of their last completed and published adventure, Tintin and the Picaros, Haddock had become such an important figure that he dominates much of the story.\nCaptain Haddock's taste for alcoholic beverages is a constant feature of the character. He is especially fond of whisky from the Loch Lomond distillery (which was fictional at the time when the character was developed, the real Loch Lomond distillery was only founded later), and at the end of the album Explorers on the Moon, he falls into a coma upon re-entry to Earth, but he immediately wakes up upon hearing the word \"whisky\". In the last completed Tintin album Tintin and the Picaros, Haddock is involuntarily cured from his alcoholism by an invention of Professor Calculus's, a pill that causes the taste of alcohol to turn horribly repulsive upon ingestion.\nCaptain (Archibald) Haddock's ancestor, Sir Francis Haddock, is hinted at being the illegitimate son of the French Sun King (Louis XIV), a possible reference to Herg\u00e9's own family history\u2014Herg\u00e9 liked to believe that his father was the illegitimate son of the Belgian king Leopold II.\n\n\n== Name ==\nAs Herg\u00e9 was considering names for his new character, he asked his wife, Germaine, what she had cooked for dinner. She told him, \"a sad English fish\u2014haddock.\u201d Herg\u00e9 thought this was a perfect name for Tintin\u2019s new mariner friend, and so Captain Haddock was born.There was a real 20th-century ship's master bearing this unlikely but appropriate surname: Captain Herbert Haddock had been the skipper of the famous White Star Line's passenger vessel Olympic. He had also been temporarily at the helm of Olympic's even more famous sister ship Titanic before Titanic was officially handed over to White Star for her doomed 1912 maiden voyage.\nAnother famous namesake, and a possible inspiration for the Captain's ancestor Sir Francis, was the English admiral Richard Haddock, a veteran of the Anglo-Dutch Wars. The grandfather of Richard Haddock, also a sea captain, commanded the ship of the line HMS Unicorn during the reign of Charles I.Bianca Castafiore has a difficult time remembering Haddock's name. In The Castafiore Emerald, she confuses his name with malapropisms such as \"Paddock\", \"Harrock\", \"Padlock\", \"Hopscotch\", \"Drydock\", \"Stopcock\", \"Maggot\", \"Bart\u00f3k\", \"Hammock\", and \"Hemlock\".\nThe fictional Haddock remained without a first name until the last completed story, Tintin and the Picaros (1976), when the name Archibald was suggested.The name appears in Herg\u00e9's notes in 1938. According to Philippe Goddin, author of Herg\u00e9 \u2013 Chronologie d'une oeuvre, it is inspired by the German French-language film Captain Craddock. In The Crab with the Golden Claws, Haddock sings one of the film songs, Les gars de la Marine.\n\n\n== Expletives ==\nAt the time of Captain Haddock's introduction to the series in 1940, the character's manners presented a problem to Herg\u00e9. As a sailor, Haddock would need to have a very colourful vocabulary, but Herg\u00e9 could not use any swear words as he knew his audience included children. The solution reportedly came when Herg\u00e9 recalled how around 1933, shortly after the Four-Power Pact had come into being, he had overheard a market trader use the word \"four-power pact\" as an insult. Struck by this use of an \"irrelevant insult\", Herg\u00e9 hit upon the solution of the Captain using strange or esoteric words that were not actually offensive, but which he would project with great anger, as if they were very strong curse words. These words ranged across a variety of subject areas, often relating to specific terms within scientific fields of study. This behaviour would in later years become one of Haddock's defining characteristics.\nThe idea took form quickly; the first appearance of the Haddockian argot occurred in The Crab with the Golden Claws when the Captain storms towards a party of Berber raiders yelling expressions like \"jellyfish\", \"troglodyte\" and \"ectoplasm\". This use of colourful insults proved successful and was a mainstay in subsequent books. Herg\u00e9 started collecting these types of words for use in Haddock's outbursts, and on occasion even searched dictionaries to come up with inspiration.As a result, Captain Haddock's colourful insults began to include \"bashi-bazouk\", \"visigoths\", \"kleptomaniac\", \"sea gherkin\", \"anacoluthon\", \"pockmark\", \"megacycle\",\"nincompoop\", \"abominable snowman\", \"nitwits\", \"scoundrels\", \"steam rollers\", \"parasites\", \"vegetarians\", \"floundering oath\", \"carpet seller\", \"blundering Bazookas\", \"Popinjay\", \"bragger\", \"pinheads\", \"miserable slugs\", \"ectomorph\", \"maniacs\", \"pickled herring\"; \"freshwater swabs\", \"miserable molecule of mildew\",\"Logarithm\", \"bandits\", \"orang-outangs\", \"cercopithecuses\", \"Polynesians\", \"iconoclasts\", \"ruffians\", \"fancy-dress freebooter\", \"ignoramus\", \"sycophant\", \"dizzard\", \"black-beetle\", \"pyrographer\", \"slave-trader\" and \"Fuzzy Wuzzy\", but again, nothing actually considered a swear word.On one occasion, this scheme appeared to backfire. In one particularly angry state, Herg\u00e9 had the captain yell the word \"pneumothorax\" (a medical emergency caused by the collapse of the lung within the chest). One week after the scene appeared in Tintin magazine, Herg\u00e9 received a letter allegedly from a father whose boy was a great fan of Tintin and also a heavy tuberculosis sufferer who had experienced a collapsed lung. According to the letter, the boy was devastated that his favourite comic made fun of his own condition. Herg\u00e9 wrote an apology and removed the word from the comic. Afterwards, the letter was discovered to be fake, written and planted by Herg\u00e9's friend and collaborator Jacques Van Melkebeke.In addition to his many insults, the most famous of Haddock's expressions relate to any of a number of permutations of two phrases: \"Billions of bilious blue blistering barnacles!\" (\"Mille millions de mille milliards de mille sabords!\"; lit.: \"A thousand millions of a thousand billions of a thousand portholes!\") and \"Ten thousand thundering typhoons!\" (\"Tonnerre de Brest!\"; lit.: \"Thunder of Brest\"). Haddock uses these two expressions to such an extent that Abdullah actually addresses him as \"Blistering Barnacles\" (\"Mille sabords\" \u2013 \"A thousand portholes\" \u2013 in the original version).\n\u00c9mile Brami, biographer of Louis-Ferdinand C\u00e9line, claimed in a 2004 interview with the French book magazine Lire that Herg\u00e9 took his inspiration from C\u00e9line's anti-Semitic pamphlet Bagatelles pour un massacre (1937) to create some of Haddock's expressions, as some of them (\"aztec,\" \"coconut,\" \"iconoclast,\" \"platypus\") appeared explicitly in C\u00e9line's book.\n\n\n== Adaptations ==\nCaptain Haddock was portrayed by Georges Wilson in Tintin and the Golden Fleece, by Jean Bouise in Tintin and the Blue Oranges, and by David Fox in The Adventures of Tintin (TV series).\nOn BBC Radio 4, he was portrayed by Leo McKern in Series One and by Lionel Jeffries in Series Two.\nIn both the 1960s and 1990s television series, Haddock spoke with an Irish accent. In the latter he was voiced by David Fox with a light Northern Irish/Ulster accent.In the animated movie Tintin and the Lake of Sharks, he was voiced by Claude Bertrand.\nIn the 2011 film The Adventures of Tintin: The Secret of the Unicorn, Andy Serkis supplies the voice and motion capture performance of Captain Haddock (adopting a Scottish accent) as well as his ancestor, Sir Francis Haddock. Just as in the comic, he is initially portrayed as a drunk, who is always in search of alcohol. Tintin endeavours to cure the captain of his alcoholism, but eventually discovers that it is an essential component of his character.\n\n\n== Commemorative statues and murals ==\nA mural on a building at Rue de l'Etuve recreates a scene of Tintin, Captain Haddock and Snowy coming down a building fire escape from The Calculus Affair.\nThe Gare du Midi station in Brussels contains a huge reproduction of a panel from Tintin in America.\nThe Stockel subway station in Brussels has huge panels with scenes from Tintin comic books painted as murals.\nOne of the high speed trains of Thalys (Tintin train) running between Brussels and Paris is covered with images from Tintin comic books including those of Captain Haddock.\nAn advertisement of Thalys shows Captain Haddock on a train platform with his trademark seabag, appearing to have stepped out of a Thalys train.\nA life size resin statue of Captain Haddock was created and displayed at the 2012 San Diego International Comics Convention (WETA booth)\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of The Adventures of Tintin characters\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\nFarr, Michael (2001).

The character has been variously depicted as articulate and sophisticated as in the original novels, and as a noble savage with limited language skills such as in the films featuring Johnny Weissmuller.\nCreated by Edgar Rice Burroughs, Tarzan first appeared in the novel Tarzan of the Apes (magazine publication 1912, book publication 1914), and subsequently in 23 sequels, several books by Burroughs and other authors, and innumerable works in other media, both authorized and unauthorized.\n\n\n== Character biography ==\nTarzan is the son of a British lord and lady who were marooned on the coast of Angola by mutineers. When Tarzan was an infant, his mother died, and his father was killed by Kerchak, leader of the ape tribe by whom Tarzan was adopted.\nSoon after his parents' death, Tarzan became a feral child, and his tribe of apes is known as the Mangani, great apes of a species unknown to science. Kala is his ape mother. Burroughs added stories occurring during Tarzan's adolescence in his sixth Tarzan book, Jungle Tales of Tarzan.\n\n\n=== Jane ===\nAs an 18-year-old, Tarzan meets a young American woman named Jane Porter. She and her father and others of their party are marooned on the same coastal jungle area where Tarzan's human parents were 20 years earlier. When Jane returns to the United States, Tarzan leaves the jungle in search of her, his one true love. In The Return of Tarzan, Tarzan and Jane marry. In later books, he lives with her for a time in England. They have one son, Jack, who takes the ape name Korak (the Killer). Tarzan is contemptuous of what he sees as the hypocrisy of civilization, so Jane and he return to Africa, making their home on an extensive estate that becomes a base for Tarzan's later adventures.\nAs revealed in Tarzan's Quest, Tarzan, Jane, Tarzan's monkey friend Nkima, and their allies gained some of the Kavuru's pills that grant immortality to their consumer.\n\n\n=== Name ===\n\n\"Tarzan\" is the ape-name of John Clayton, Viscount Greystoke, according to Burroughs' Tarzan, Lord of the Jungle. (Later, less canonical sources, notably the 1984 film Greystoke, make him Earl of Greystoke.) The narrator in Tarzan of the Apes describes both \"Clayton\" and \"Greystoke\" as fictitious names, implying that, within the fictional world that Tarzan inhabits, he may have a different real name.\nBurroughs considered other names for the character, including \"Zantar\" and \"Tublat Zan\", before he settled on \"Tarzan\". Though the copyright on Tarzan of the Apes has expired in the United States and in other countries, Edgar Rice Burroughs, Inc. claims the name \"Tarzan\" as a trademark.\n\n\n=== Physical abilities ===\n\nTarzan's jungle upbringing gives him abilities far beyond those of ordinary humans. These include climbing, clinging, and leaping as well as any great ape. He uses branches, swings from vines to travel at great speed, and can use his feet like hands (he prefers going barefoot because he relies on the flexibility of bare feet), a skill acquired among the anthropoid apes.\nHis strength, speed, stamina, agility, reflexes, and swimming skills are extraordinary; he has wrestled not just full-grown apes, but also gorillas, lions, rhinos, crocodiles, pythons, leopards, sharks, tigers, giant seahorses, and even dinosaurs (when he visited Pellucidar). Tarzan is a skilled tracker, and uses his exceptional hearing and keen sense of smell to follow prey or avoid predators.\n\n\n=== Language and literacy ===\nAs originally depicted, Tarzan/John Clayton is very intelligent and articulate, and does not speak in broken English as the classic movies of the 1930s depict him. He can communicate with many species of jungle animals, and has been shown to be a skilled impressionist, able to mimic the sound of a gunshot perfectly.\nTarzan is literate in English before he first encountered other English-speaking people. His literacy is self-taught after several years in his early teens by visiting the log cabin of his infancy and looking at children's primer/picture books. He eventually reads every book in his father's portable book collection, and is fully aware of geography, basic world history, and his family tree. He is \"found\" by traveling Frenchman Paul d'Arnot, who teaches him the basics of human speech and returns with him to civilization. When Tarzan first encounters d'Arnot, he tells him (in writing): \"I speak only the language of my tribe\u2014the great apes who were Kerchak's; and a little of the languages of Tantor, the elephant, and Numa, the lion, and of the other folks of the jungle I understand.\"\nTarzan can learn a new language in days, ultimately speaking many languages, including that of the great apes, French, Finnish, English, Dutch, German, Swahili, many other Bantu languages, Arabic, Ancient Greek, Ancient Latin, and Mayan, as well as the languages of the Ant Men and of Pellucidar.\n\n\n== Literature ==\n\nTarzan has been called one of the best-known literary characters in the world. In addition to more than two dozen books by Burroughs and a handful more by authors with the blessing of Burroughs' estate, the character has appeared in films, radio, television, comic strips, and comic books. Numerous parodies and pirated works have also appeared.\n\n\n=== Critical reception ===\nWhile Tarzan of the Apes met with some critical success, subsequent books in the series received a cooler reception and have been criticized for being derivative and formulaic. The characters are often said to be two-dimensional, the dialogue wooden, and the storytelling devices (such as excessive reliance on coincidence) strain credulity. According to Rudyard Kipling (who himself wrote stories of a feral child, The Jungle Book's Mowgli), Burroughs wrote Tarzan of the Apes just so he could \"find out how bad a book he could write and get away with it.\"While Burroughs was not a polished novelist, he was a vivid storyteller. Most of his novels are still in print. In 1963, author Gore Vidal wrote a piece on the Tarzan series that, while pointing out several of the deficiencies that the Tarzan books have as works of literature, praises Burroughs for creating a compelling \"daydream figure.\" Critical reception grew more positive with the 1981 study by Erling B. Holtsmark, Tarzan and Tradition: Classical Myth in Popular Literature. Holtsmark added a volume on Burroughs for Twayne's United States Author Series in 1986. In 2010, Stan Galloway provided a sustained study of the adolescent period of the fictional Tarzan's life in The Teenage Tarzan.Despite critical panning, the Tarzan stories have remained popular. Burroughs' melodramatic situations and the elaborate details he works into his fictional world, such as his construction of a partial language for his great apes, appeal to a worldwide fan base.\n\n\n=== Unauthorized works ===\n\nAfter Burroughs' death, a number of writers produced new Tarzan stories. In some instances, the estate managed to prevent publication of such works. The most notable example in the United States was a series of five novels by the pseudonymous \"Barton Werper\" that appeared 1964\u201365 by Gold Star Books (part of Charlton Comics). As a result of legal action by Edgar Rice Burroughs, Inc., they were taken off the market. Similar series appeared in other countries, notably Argentina, Israel, and some Arab countries.\n\n\n=== Modern fiction ===\nIn 1972, science-fiction author Philip Jos\u00e9 Farmer wrote Tarzan Alive, a biography of Tarzan using the frame device that he was a real person. In Farmer's fictional universe, Tarzan, along with Doc Savage and Sherlock Holmes, are the cornerstones of the Wold Newton family. Farmer wrote two novels, Hadon of Ancient Opar and Flight to Opar, set in the distant past and giving further knowledge of the antecedents of the lost city of Opar, which plays an important role in the Tarzan books. In addition, Farmer's A Feast Unknown, and its two sequels Lord of the Trees and The Mad Goblin, are pastiches of the Tarzan and Doc Savage stories, with the premise that they tell the story of the real characters upon which the fictional characters are based. A Feast Unknown is somewhat infamous among Tarzan and Doc Savage fans for its graphic violence and sexual content.\n\n\n== Themes of gender and race ==\nIn her Manliness and Civilization, Gail Bederman describes how various people of the time either challenged or upheld the idea that \"civilization\" is predicated on white masculinity. She closes with a chapter on Tarzan of the Apes (1912) because the story's protagonist is, according to her, the ultimate male by the standards of 1912 White Americans. Bederman does note that Tarzan, \"an instinctively chivalrous Anglo-Saxon,\" does not engage in sexual violence, renouncing his \"masculine impulse to rape.\" However, she also notes that not only does Tarzan kill black man Kulonga in revenge for killing his ape mother (a stand-in for his biological White mother) by hanging him, \"lyncher Tarzan\" actually enjoys killing black people, for example the cannibalistic Mbongans.\nBederman, in fact, reminds readers that when Tarzan first introduces himself to Jane, he does so as \"Tarzan, the killer of beasts and many black men\". The novel climaxes with Tarzan saving Jane (who in the original novel is not British, but a White woman from Baltimore, Maryland) from a black ape rapist. When he leaves the jungle and sees \"civilized\" Africans farming, his first instinct is to kill them just for being Black. \"Like the lynch victims reported in the Northern press, Tarzan's victims\u2014cowards, cannibals, and despoilers of white womanhood\u2014lack all manhood. Tarzan's lynchings thus prove him the superior man.\"\nAccording to Bederman, despite embodying all the tropes of white supremacy espoused or rejected by the people she had reviewed (Theodore Roosevelt, G. Stanley Hall, Charlotte Perkins Gilman, Ida B. Wells), Burroughs, in all probability, was not trying to make any kind of statement or echo any of them. \"He probably never heard of any of them.\" Instead, Bederman writes that Burroughs proves her point because, in telling racist and sexist stories whose protagonist boasted of killing black people, he was not being unusual at all, but was instead just being a typical 1912 White American.\n\n\n=== Race ===\nThe Tarzan books and movies employ extensive stereotyping. With changing social views and customs this has led to criticism, including charges of racism since the early 1970s. The early books give a pervasively negative and stereotypical portrayal of native Africans, including Arabs. In The Return of Tarzan, Arabs are \"surly looking\" and call Christians \"dogs\", while black Africans are \"lithe, ebon warriors, gesticulating and jabbering\".\nIn regards to race, a superior\u2013inferior relationship with valuation is implied in virtually all interactions between white and black people in the Tarzan stories, and similar relationships and valuations can be seen in most other interactions between differing people. According to James Loewen's Sundown Towns, this may be a vestige of Burroughs' having been from Oak Park, Illinois, a former Sundown town (a town that forbids non-white people from living within it).Tarzan is a white European male who grows up with apes. According to \"Taking Tarzan Seriously\" by Marianna Torgovnick, Tarzan is confused with the social hierarchy that he is a part of. Unlike everyone else in his society, Tarzan is the only one who is not clearly part of any social group. All the other members of his world are not able to climb or decline socially because they are already part of a social hierarchy which is stagnant. Turgovnick writes that since Tarzan was raised as an ape, he thinks and acts like an ape. However, instinctively he is human and he resorts to being human when he is pushed to. The reason of his confusion is that he does not understand what the typical white male is supposed to act like. His instincts eventually kick in when he is in the midst of this confusion, and he ends up dominating the jungle. In Tarzan, the jungle is a microcosm for the world in general in 1912 to the early 1930s. His climbing of the social hierarchy proves that the European white male is the most dominant of all races/sexes, no matter what the circumstance. Furthermore, Turgovnick writes that when Tarzan first meets Jane, she is slightly repulsed but also fascinated by his animal-like actions. As the story progresses, Tarzan surrenders his knife to Jane in an oddly chivalrous gesture, which makes Jane fall for Tarzan despite his odd circumstances. Turgovnick believes that this displays an instinctual, civilized chivalry that Burrough believes is common in white men.\n\n\n=== Gender dynamic ===\nBurroughs' opinions, manifested through the narrative voice in the stories, reflect common attitudes in his time, which in a 21st-century context would be considered racist and sexist.\n\nAlthough the character of Tarzan does not directly engage in violence against women, feminist scholars have critiqued the presence of other sympathetic male characters who do so with Tarzan's approval. In Tarzan and the Ant Men, the men of a fictional tribe of creatures called the Alali gain social dominance of their society by beating Alali women into submission with weapons that Tarzan willingly provides them. Following the battle, Burroughs (p. 178) states:To entertain Tarzan and to show him what great strides civilization had taken\u2014the son of The First Woman seized a female by the hair and dragging her to him struck her heavily about the head and face with his clenched fist, and the woman fell upon her knees and fondled his legs, looking wistfully into his face, her own glowing with love and admiration.While Burroughs depicts some female characters with humanistic equalizing elements, Torgovnick argues that violent scenes against women in the context of male political and social domination are condoned in his writing, reinforcing a notion of gendered hierarchy where patriarchy is portrayed as the natural pinnacle of society.\n\n\n== Tarzan in other media ==\n\n\n=== Film ===\nThe first Tarzan films were silent pictures adapted from the original Tarzan novels, which appeared within a few years of the character's creation. The first actor to portray the adult Tarzan was Elmo Lincoln in 1918's film Tarzan of the Apes. With the advent of talking pictures, a popular Tarzan film franchise was developed, lasting from the 1930s through the 1960s. Starting with Tarzan the Ape Man in 1932 through twelve films until 1948, the franchise was anchored by former Olympic swimmer Johnny Weissmuller in the title role. Tarzan films from the 1930s on often featured Tarzan's chimpanzee companion Cheeta, his consort Jane (not usually given a last name), and an adopted son, usually known only as \"Boy.\" However, productions by Sy Weintraub from 1959 onward dropped the character of Jane and portrayed Tarzan as a lone adventurer. Later Tarzan films have been occasional and somewhat idiosyncratic.\nThere were also several serials and features that competed with the main franchise, including Tarzan the Fearless (1933) starring Buster Crabbe and The New Adventures of Tarzan (1935) starring Herman Brix. The latter serial was unique for its period in that it was partially filmed on location (Guatemala) and portrayed Tarzan as educated. It was the only Tarzan film project for which Burroughs was personally involved in the production.\nWeissmuller and his immediate successors were enjoined to portray the ape-man as a noble savage speaking broken English, in marked contrast to the cultured aristocrat of Edgar Rice Burroughs' novels (the pidgin English being more linguistically plausible). With the exception of Burroughs' co-produced The New Adventures of Tarzan, this \"me Tarzan, you Jane\" characterization of Tarzan persisted until the late 1950s, when Weintraub, having bought the film rights from producer Sol Lesser, produced Tarzan's Greatest Adventure (1959) followed by eight other films and a television series. The Weintraub productions portray a Tarzan that is closer to Burroughs' original concept in the novels: a jungle lord who speaks grammatical English and is well educated and familiar with civilization. Most Tarzan films made before the mid-1950s were black-and-white films shot on studio sets, with stock jungle footage edited in. The Weintraub productions from 1959 on were shot in foreign locations and were in color.\nMore recently, Tarzan, the Ape Man, starring Miles O'Keeffe and Bo Derek, was released in 1981. Tony Goldwyn voiced Tarzan in Disney's animated film of the same name, released in 1999. This version marked a new beginning for the ape man, taking its inspiration equally from Burroughs and the 1984 live-action film Greystoke: The Legend of Tarzan, Lord of the Apes. Since Greystoke, two additional live-action Tarzan films have been released, 1998's Tarzan and the Lost City and 2016's The Legend of Tarzan, both period pieces that drew inspiration from Edgar Rice Burroughs' writings.\n\n\n=== Radio ===\n\nTarzan was the hero of two popular radio programs in the United States. The first aired from 1932 to 1936 with James Pierce in the role of Tarzan. The second ran from 1951 to 1953 with Lamont Johnson in the title role.The Tarzan book series was later modernized and parodied in an authorized 2021 golden-age radio styled podcast program entitled The Adventures of Tarzan, produced by the Freshly Squeezed Pulp comedy troupe of Duke University.\n\n\n=== Television ===\n\nTelevision later emerged as a primary vehicle bringing the character to the public. From the mid-1950s, all the extant sound Tarzan films became staples of Saturday morning television aimed at young and teenaged viewers. In 1958, movie Tarzan Gordon Scott filmed three episodes for a prospective television series. The program did not sell, but a different live action Tarzan series produced by Sy Weintraub and starring Ron Ely ran on NBC from 1966 to 1968. This depiction of Tarzan is a well-educated bachelor who grew tired of urban civilization and is in his native African jungle once again.\nTarzan was voiced by Robert Ridgely and Danton Burroughs in the animated series from Filmation, titled Tarzan, Lord of the Jungle (1976\u20131977), as well as in the anthology programs that followed:\n\nBatman/Tarzan Adventure Hour (1977\u20131978);\nTarzan and the Super 7 (1978\u20131980);\nThe Tarzan/Lone Ranger Adventure Hour (1980\u20131981); and\nThe Tarzan/Lone Ranger/Zorro Adventure Hour (1981\u20131982).Joe Lara starred in the title role in Tarzan in Manhattan (1989), an offbeat TV movie, and later returned in a completely different interpretation, titled Tarzan: The Epic Adventures (1996), a new live-action series.\nIn between the two productions with Lara, Tarz\u00e1n (1991\u20131994), a half-hour syndicated series in which Tarzan is portrayed as a blond environmentalist, with Jane turned into a French ecologist.\nDisney's animated series The Legend of Tarzan (2001\u20132003) was a spin-off of the animated Disney film from 1999.\nThe latest television series was the short-lived live-action Tarzan (2003), which starred male model Travis Fimmel and updated the setting to contemporary New York City, with Jane as a police detective, played by Sarah Wayne Callies. The series was cancelled after only eight episodes.\nSaturday Night Live featured recurring sketches with the speech-impaired trio of \"Tonto, Tarzan, and Frankenstein's Monster\". In these sketches, Tarzan is portrayed by Kevin Nealon.\n\n\n=== Stage ===\nA 1921 Broadway production of Tarzan of The Apes starred Ronald Adair as Tarzan and Ethel Dwyer as Jane Porter.\nIn 1976, Richard O'Brien wrote a musical entitled T. Zee, loosely based on Tarzan but restyled in a rock idiom.\nTarzan, a musical stage adaptation of the 1999 animated feature, opened at the Richard Rodgers Theatre on Broadway on May 10, 2006, and closed on July 8, 2007.\nThe show, a Disney Theatrical production, was directed and designed by Bob Crowley. The same version of Tarzan that was played at the Richard Rodgers Theatre is being played throughout Europe and has been a huge success in the Netherlands.\nTarzan also appeared in the Tarzan Rocks! show at the Theatre in the Wild at Walt Disney World Resort's Disney's Animal Kingdom. Although the show closed in 2006, Tarzan, Jane Porter and Terk remain popular meetable characters at the Disney Parks and Resorts, and can be found in Adventureland, and at Disney's Animal Kingdom.\n\n\n=== Video games ===\nA game under the title Tarzan Goes Ape, with little connection to the franchise, was released in the 1980s for the Commodore 64 and ZX Spectrum.\nA Tarzan computer game by Michael Archer was produced by Martech.\nDisney's Tarzan had seen video games released for the PlayStation, Nintendo 64 and Game Boy Color. Followed by:\nDisney's Tarzan Untamed for the PlayStation 2 (PS2) and Gamecube\nDisney's Tarzan: Return to the Jungle for the Game Boy Advance.\nThe Disney incarnation of Tarzan appears in the PS2 game Kingdom Hearts, with Goldwyn reprising his role from the film.\nIn the first Rayman, a Tarzanesque version of Rayman named Tarayzan appears in the Dream Forest.\n\n\n=== Toys and ephemera ===\nThroughout the 1970s Mego Corporation licensed the Tarzan character and produced 8\" action figures which they included in their \"World's Greatest Super Heroes\" line of characters. In 1975 they also produced a 3\" \"Bendy\" figure made of poseable, malleable plastic.\nSeveral Tarzan-themed products have been manufactured, including View-Master reels and packets, numerous Tarzan coloring books, children's books, follow-the-dots, and activity books.\n\n\n=== Comics ===\n\nTarzan of the Apes was adapted in newspaper-strip form in early 1929, with illustrations by Hal Foster. A full-page Sunday strip began March 15, 1931, by Rex Maxon. Over the years, many artists have drawn the Tarzan comic strip, notably Burne Hogarth, Russ Manning, and Mike Grell. The daily strip began to reprint old dailies after Manning's last daily (#10,308; publ. July 29, 1972). The Sunday strip also turned to reprints c.\u20092000. Both strips continue as reprints today in a few newspapers and in Comics Revue magazine. NBM Publishing did a high quality reprint series of the Foster and Hogarth work on Tarzan in a series of hardback and paperback reprints in the 1990s.\nTarzan has appeared in many comic books from numerous publishers over the years. The character's earliest comic book appearances were in comic strip reprints published in several titles, such as Sparkler, Tip Top Comics and Single Series. Western Publishing published Tarzan in Dell Comics's Four Color Comics #134 & 161 in 1947, before giving him his own series, Tarzan, published through Dell Comics and later Gold Key Comics from January\u2013February 1948 to February 1972; many of these issues adapted Burroughs' novels.\nDC took over the series in 1972, publishing Tarzan #207\u2013258 from April 1972 to February 1977, including work by Joe Kubert. In 1977, the series moved to Marvel Comics, who restarted the numbering rather than assuming those of the previous publishers. Marvel issued Tarzan #1\u201329 (as well as three Annuals), from June 1977 to October 1979, mainly by John Buscema.\nFollowing the conclusion of the Marvel series the character had no regular comic-book publisher for a number of years. During this period, Blackthorne Comics published Tarzan in 1986, and Malibu Comics published Tarzan comics in 1992. Dark Horse Comics has published various Tarzan series from 1996 to the present, including reprints of works from previous publishers like Gold Key and DC, and joint projects with other publishers featuring crossovers with other characters.\nThere have also been a number of different comic book projects from other publishers over the years, in addition to various minor appearances of Tarzan in other comic books. The Japanese manga series Jungle no Ouja Ta-chan (Jungle King Tar-chan) by Tokuhiro Masaya was based loosely on Tarzan. Also, manga \"god\" Osamu Tezuka created a Tarzan manga in 1948 entitled Tarzan no Himitsu Kichi (Tarzan's Secret Base).\n\n\n== Cultural influence ==\n\n\n=== Science ===\n\nTarzan's primitivist philosophy was absorbed by countless fans, amongst whom was Jane Goodall, who describes the Tarzan series as having a major influence on her childhood. She states that she felt she would be a much better spouse for Tarzan than his fictional wife, Jane, and that when she first began to live among and study the chimpanzees she was fulfilling her childhood dream of living among the great apes just as Tarzan did.Tarzan is commemorated in the scientific name of a species of chameleon, Calumma tarzan, which is endemic to Madagascar.\n\n\n=== Literature ===\n Rudyard Kipling's Mowgli has been cited as a major influence on Burroughs' creation of Tarzan. Mowgli was also an influence for a number of other \"wild boy\" characters.\nJerry Siegel named Tarzan and another Burroughs character, John Carter, as early inspiration for his creation of Superman.Tarzan's popularity inspired numerous imitators in pulp magazines. A number of these, like Kwa and Ka-Zar were direct or loosely veiled copies; others, like Polaris of the Snows, were similar characters in different settings, or with different gimmicks. Of these characters the most popular was Ki-Gor, the subject of 59 novels that appeared between winter 1939 to spring 1954 in the magazine Jungle Stories.\n\n\n=== Popular culture ===\nTarzan is often used as a nickname to indicate a similarity between a person's characteristics and that of the fictional character. Individuals with an exceptional 'ape-like' ability to climb, cling and leap beyond that of ordinary humans may often receive the nickname 'Tarzan'. An example is retired American baseball player Joe Wallis.Comedian Carol Burnett was often prompted by her audiences to perform her trademark Tarzan yell. She explained that it originated in her youth when she and a friend watched a Tarzan movie.\n\n\n== Tarzan and Pellucidar main series chronology ==\nTarzan of the Apes, Chapters 1 to 11 (1912)\nJungle Tales of Tarzan (1919)\"Tarzan's First Love\" (1916)\n\"The Capture of Tarzan\" (1916)\n\"The Fight for the Balu\" (1916)\n\"The God of Tarzan\" (1916)\n\"Tarzan and the Black Boy\" (1917)\n\"The Witch-Doctor Seeks Vengeance\" (1917)\n\"The End of Bukawai\" (1917)\n\"The Lion\" (1917)\n\"The Nightmare\" (1917)\n\"The Battle for Teeka\" (1917)\n\"A Jungle Joke\" (1917)\n\"Tarzan Rescues the Moon\" (1917)\nTarzan of the Apes, Chapters 11 to 28 (1912)\nThe Return of Tarzan (1913)\nThe Beasts of Tarzan (1914) (Ebook) (Audiobook)\nAt the Earth's Core (1914)\nThe Son of Tarzan, Chapters 1 to 12 (1915) (Ebook) (Audiobook)\nPellucidar (1915)\nTarzan and the Forbidden City (1938) (Ebook)\nTarzan and the Jewels of Opar (1916) (Ebook) (Audiobook)\nThe Son of Tarzan Chapters 13 to 27 (1915) (Ebook) (Audiobook)\n\"The Eternal Lover\" (The Eternal Lover Part 1) All-Story Weekly, March 7, 1914\n\"The Mad King\" (The Mad King Part 1) All-Story Weekly March 21, 1914\n\"Sweetheart Primeval\" (The Eternal Lover Part 2) All-Story Weekly, Jan.\u2013Feb. 1915\n\"Barney Custer of Beatrice\" (The Mad King Part 2) All-Story Weekly, August 1915\nTarzan the Untamed (1920) (Ebook)\n\"Tarzan and the Huns\" (1919)\n\"Tarzan and the Valley of Luna\" (1920)\nTarzan the Terrible (1921) (Ebook) (Audiobook)\nTarzan and the Golden Lion (1922, 1923) (Ebook)\nTarzan and the Ant Men (1924) (Ebook)\nTarzan and the Tarzan Twins (1963; for younger readers)\n\"The Tarzan Twins\" (1927) (Ebook)\n\"Tarzan and the Tarzan Twins and Jad-Bal-Ja the Golden Lion\" (1936) (Ebook)\nTarzan, Lord of the Jungle (1927, 1928) (Ebook)\nTarzan and the Lost Empire (1928) (Ebook)\nTanar of Pellucidar (1929)\nTarzan at the Earth's Core (1929) (Ebook)\nTarzan the Invincible (1930, 1931) (Ebook)\nTarzan Triumphant (1931) (Ebook)\nTarzan and the City of Gold (1932) (Ebook)\nTarzan and the Lion Man (1933, 1934) (Ebook)\nTarzan and the Leopard Men (1935) (Ebook)\nTarzan's Quest (1935, 1936) (Ebook)\nTarzan the Magnificent (1939) (Ebook)\n\"Tarzan and the Magic Men\" (1936)\nBack to the Stone Age (1937)\nTarzan and the Elephant Men\" (1937\u20131938)\nTarzan and the Champion\" (1940)\nTarzan and the Jungle Murders\" (1940)\nTarzan and the Madman (1964)\nTarzan and the Castaways (1941) (Ebook)\nLand of Terror (1944)\nTarzan and the Foreign Legion (1947) (Ebook)\nSavage Pellucidar (1963)\n\"The Return to Pellucidar\"\n\"Men of the Bronze Age\"\n\"Tiger Girl\"\n\"Savage Pellucidar\"\nTarzan: the Lost Adventure (c. 1940s; unfinished \u2013 16 chapters, 83 pages; revised and completed by Joe R.

She also appears as a playable character in the crossover multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) game Heroes of the Storm and as a gameplay announcer in StarCraft II: Legacy of the Void. In English-language media, D.Va is voiced by Charlet Chung.\nIn Overwatch lore, D.Va is a pro-eSports gamer named Hana Song (Revised Romanization: Song Ha-na) (\uc1a1\ud558\ub098) from Busan, South Korea. Within the Overwatch narrative, the Korean government's Mobile Exo-Force of the Korean Army (MEKA) recruits D.Va and other gamers to help quell an uprising by robotic Omnics, using their video-game-playing skills to control weaponized mech suits. Within the game, D.Va is a tank character who can deal a stream of damage and, for a short time, neutralize incoming attacks. If her suit is destroyed, she can eject from it and survive long enough to call in a new suit. Her ultimate ability allows her to self-detonate her suit, dealing heavy enough damage to all enemies in her line of sight to eliminate most characters.\nD.Va has been well received by critics and players, particularly among Overwatch's female and LGBT fanbase.\n\n\n== Development and design ==\nD.Va, along with Genji and Mei, was announced in October 2015 at BlizzCon; she was one of the final heroes to be introduced into Overwatch prior to its official release. Voice actor Charlet Chung provides the character's English- and Korean-language voices. D.Va is designed as a tank character who uses a highly mobile pink mech suit in battle, and acts as a \"skirmisher\".One of Overwatch's initial character concepts was a hero who piloted a mech; the designers ultimately decided that the pilot could eject if their suit sustained critical damage and fight outside without protection. The game's assistant art director Arnold Tsang was inspired by mecha anime and manga for D.Va's look. The designers initially based the mech's stickers and artwork on a cat theme, but later changed it to a rabbit because they thought its short-range booster rockets made it look as though it was bunny hopping.Soon after the game's release, D.Va was noted for having a low damage output; the game's principal designer Geoff Goodman said; \"D.Va's damage is definitely on the lower side, much like Winston's. They are this way for a similar reason: They are both very mobile and hard to kill.\" Because she lacked a shield, D.Va was also noted to take more damage than other tank characters when facing multiple opponents. Goodman attributed this and her low damage output to the game's character balancing, stating; \"every character in the game has strengths and weaknesses, it's part of what makes the teamplay work well\".According to Goodman, early in her development, D.Va was able to deal more damage but her damage output was lowered because \"she would fly into someone's face, destroy them, and fly away. There was little that person could do because [of] her mobility.\" Despite agreeing with feedback calling D.Va under-powered, Goodman said improvements to the character \"are unlikely to take the shape of increasing her damage output significantly\", adding \"the goal is that she should be a viable aggressive initiation tank, much like Winston can be\". The discussion of buffing D.Va coincided with a discussion on nerfing the character McCree, who had been noted to eliminate tank characters too quickly; game director Jeff Kaplan said D.Va's buffs would take longer to develop and implement than the changes to McCree. Kaplan also said the development team would be exploring improvements to her damage output and survivability but would \"probably pick one direction or the other\". The character's ultimate ability was eventually buffed; the cost and explosion delay were reduced and the possibility for the activating player to be killed by their own ultimate ability was removed. Her \"Defense Matrix\" ability was changed to be toggled on and off at will with a resource meter rather than being a single-use ability with a cooldown.In August 2017, in response to their observations of the meta-game, Blizzard planned to introduce changes to D.Va to be tested in the Public Test Realm (PTR) server and evaluated before full release. Namely, the developers found that D.Va was being used more frequently to absorb damage through her Defense Matrix and was not being played offensively. The revamped skill kit would increase the rate of energy depletion of the Defense Matrix, effectively reducing its use time by half, but would allow her to use her main weapon while boosting. The update also added a new Micro Missiles ability that launches a number of small missiles that do damage in a small area on impact. Kaplan said that the overall goal of D.Va's ability retooling was to \"reduce her reliance on Defense Matrix and make her more fun to play,\" and stressed the changes were not meant to nerf D.Va overall. These changes were added for all players in a September 2017 patch.Blizzard considers D.Va the most difficult character that they must develop around when adding new game modes or other features; as described by assistant director Aaron Keller, \"she breaks everything\" due to having two different forms for which they must account.\n\n\n== Gameplay ==\nD.Va possesses a tank role in Overwatch; PC Gamer has described D.Va as an \"offtank\" character, which typically allows players \"more freedom to play [aggressively]\" compared to other tank characters. She is suited in her mech which is equipped with twin Fusion Cannons that do not need reloading. The Fusion Cannons deal substantial damage at close range, but consequentially slow her mobility. D.Va also comes equipped with Boosters and a Defense Matrix; the Boosters quickly move her in the direction that the player's reticle is facing, potentially allowing for short periods of flight, and additionally lightly damaging and knocking back enemies that come in contact with her while boosting. D.Va's Defense Matrix absorbs incoming enemy projectiles heading toward her. She can also fire a volley of Micro-Missiles that have a small area of splash damage upon impact.Once her mech suit runs out of hitpoints (HP), D.Va ejects out of it, equipped with only a Light Gun. Though more vulnerable while outside the mech, she is a considerably smaller and more maneuverable target in this state. D.Va can also eject out of her mech suit as part of her Self Destruct ultimate ability, which causes her mech suit to explode and deal massive area of effect damage shortly after ejection. Once the mech explodes, D.Va can use her second ultimate ability, Call Mech, which simply allows her to resuit into her mech. This can be done immediately after using the Self Destruct ability, but otherwise has a cooldown period that can be sped up by damaging opponents while on foot.\n\n\n== Appearances ==\n\n\n=== Overwatch ===\nIn Overwatch lore, D.Va is Hana Song, a 19-year old former professional gamer going by her gamertag \"D.Va\". D.Va was known for becoming the No. 1 ranked StarCraft II player in the world at age 16 and maintaining an undefeated record prior to her retirement from gaming in order to defend her homeland. During the in-universe Omnic Crisis event, an omnic monster rose from the East China Sea, destroying coastal cities including those in South Korea and its neighbors. The South Korean government developed the Mobile Exo-Force of the Korean Army (MEKA), a mobile armored drone unit to combat the omnic monster, although each battle resulted in a stalemate. The omnic continued to adapt to the MEKA's drone networks, turning them against the Koreans. The South Korean government struggled with finding pilots for new mechs, eventually turned to the country's professional gamers, thought to have necessary reflexes and instincts to effectively operate the mech suits' advanced weaponry. Based in Busan, D.Va was one of the pro gamers drafted by South Korea's government. Known for being fearless in combat against the omnics, she would develop a global following as she began live streaming her combat encounters. Within MEKA, D.Va is supported by Dae-hyun, a mechanic and D.Va's childhood friend, and takes orders from Myung, the MEKA's commanding officer.D.Va's origin story is the focus of the animated short Shooting Star, released in August 2018. Its release coincided with a new control map based on Busan. The short shows the origin of D.Va's Self-Destruct ability, being forced to use it to fend off a wave of attacking Omnics to protect Busan.\n\n\n=== Heroes of the Storm ===\nIn May 2017, as part of the version 2.0 update, D.Va was added to the roster of playable heroes for the Blizzard's crossover multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) game Heroes of the Storm. Additionally, those who played Heroes of the Storm during the game's version 2.0 launch event, dubbed \"Nexus Challenge 2.0\", received cosmetics for D.Va's character in Overwatch. D.Va made her first appearance for Heroes of the Storm in the \"Hanamura Showdown\", a non-canon cinematic trailer for the Heroes 2.0 update, in April 2017. She was the fifth Overwatch character added to that game.\n\n\n=== Other appearances ===\nAs Overwatch lore heralds her as a world champion StarCraft II player, D.Va was added as a gameplay announcer for StarCraft II: Legacy of the Void, originally as part of a gift bundle, including announcer and player portrait features for attendees of BlizzCon 2016.\n\n\n== Reception ==\n\nD.Va has been positively received by both video game journalists and the game's community, topping numerous fan popularity polls. Tech Insider's Steve Kovach called D.Va his favorite character. Kotaku's Kirk Hamilton positively received the buff she received in July 2016, writing that it \"transformed her into the high-flying terror I've always wanted her to be.\" A popular meme of the character; dubbed \"Gremlin D.Va\", features fan art of the character in which a chibi version of her is portrayed indulging in gamer stereotypes, such as eating Doritos and drinking Mountain Dew. An August 2016 Overwatch patch included a new emote for D.Va in which she sits in her mech playing a shoot 'em up game while eating chips and drinking a soft drink, alluding to the meme. Lead hero designer Geoff Goodman stated, \"we love Gremlin D.Va,\" when speaking on Blizzard's favorite fan interpretation of characters. Katherine Cross of Gamasutra noted that many versions of the meme were \"queer [and] aimed at the game's LGBT fanbase\".In South Korea, D.Va has been used as a representative of the National D.Va Association, later renamed as FAMERZ, a group of South Korean Overwatch players that support women's and LGBTQ rights which was formed to protest against former South Korean President Park Geun-hye. The group uses D.Va-related logos as demonstration material, with some appearing during international coverage of the 2017 Women's March in January 2017.FAMERZ have, however, criticized some of the character's cosmetic skins, such as \"Academy\", based on a Japanese school uniform, and \"Black Cat\", based on gothic lolita fashion, saying that they sexualize and project too much male desire onto a character that otherwise well-represented women in Korea. The group also expressed concern that the skins' Japanese inspiration caused her to be conflated with women from other Asian countries, reinforcing misogynist and racist attitudes. D.Va's \"Officer\" skin received backlash from fans in the Black Lives Matter movement, who saw it as a symbol of police brutality, though others noted that the uniform was South Korean rather than American.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==", "infobox": {"name": "D.Va", "image": "D.Va Overwatch.png", "caption": "Artwork of D.Va alongside her mech suit", "series": "[[Overwatch (video game)|Overwatch]]", "voice": "[[Charlet Chung]] (English)", "gender": "Female", "occupation": "Professional gamer (former)<br />Mech pilot<br />[[Online streamer]]", "nationality": "South Korean", "weapon": "Light Gun<br />Mech", "last_major": "[[Heroes of the Storm]]", "last_date": "2017", "first_major": "[[Overwatch (video game)|Overwatch]]", "first_date": "2016", "color": "#ffccff"}, "wikidata": {"instance of (P31)": ["fictional human (Q15632617)", "video game character (Q1569167)", "animated character (Q15711870)", "comics character (Q1114461)"], "sex or gender (P21)": "female (Q6581072)", "present in work (P1441)": ["Overwatch (Q18515944)", "Heroes of the Storm (Q15139655)"], "from narrative universe (P1080)": "Overwatch universe (Q56529315)", "languages spoken, written or signed (P1412)": ["English (Q1860)", "Korean (Q9176)"], "ethnic group (P172)": "Koreans (Q484464)", "voice actor (P725)": "Charlet Chung (Q29052062)", "given name (P735)": "Hana (Q3126650)", "family name (P734)": "Song (Q11705831)", "occupation (P106)": ["professional gamer (Q4379701)", "mech pilot (Q76831610)", "actor (Q33999)"], "name in native language (P1559)": "\uc1a1\ud558\ub098", "country of citizenship (P27)": "South Korea (Q884)", "residence (P551)": "Busan (Q16520)", "official website (P856)": "https://playoverwatch.com/en-us/heroes/dva/", "Comic Vine ID (P5905)": "4005-137900", "Giant Bomb ID (P5247)": "3005-32385", "Fandom article ID (P6262)": ["overwatch:D.Va", "cosplay:D.Va"], "narrative age (P6249)": {"amount": "+19", "unit": "http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q24564698"}, "height (P2048)": {"amount": "+62", "unit": "http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q218593"}, "hair color (P1884)": "brown hair (Q2367101)", "eye color (P1340)": "brown (Q17122705)", "Quora topic ID (P3417)": "Dva-Overwatch", "pseudonym (P742)": "D.va", "media franchise (P8345)": "Overwatch (Q99569678)", "All the Tropes identifier (P8895)": "Overwatch/Characters#D.va", "TV Tropes identifier (P6839)": "Characters/OverwatchTank", "Google Knowledge Graph ID (P2671)": "/g/11c0rmk39k", "Behind The Voice Actors character ID (P5107)": "Overwatch/D-Va"}, "cat": "Comics_characters", "url": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D.Va", "wikibase": "Q25204472"}, {"name": "Richard R. Arnold II", "url_name": "11812032", "txt": "Richard Robert \"Ricky\" Arnold II (born November 26, 1963 in Cheverly, Maryland) is an American educator and a  NASA astronaut. He flew on Space Shuttle mission STS-119, which launched March 15, 2009 and delivered the final set of solar arrays to the International Space Station. He launched again in 2018 to the ISS, onboard Soyuz MS-08.\nArnold was raised in Bowie, Maryland and is married to Eloise Miller Arnold of Bowie. They have two daughters.\n\n\n== Education ==\nBowie High School, Bowie, Maryland, 1981.\nB.S., Accounting, Frostburg State University, Maryland, 1985.\nCompleted teacher certification program at Frostburg State University, Maryland, 1988.\nM.S., Marine, Estuarine, & Environmental Sciences, University of Maryland, 1992.\n\n\n== Organizations ==\nNational Science Teachers Association\nInternational Technology Education Association\nNational Council of Teachers of Mathematics\n\n\n== Career ==\nArnold began working at the United States Naval Academy in 1987 as an Oceanographic Technician. Upon completing his teacher certification program, he accepted a position as a science teacher at John Hanson Middle School in Waldorf, Maryland. During his tenure, he completed a Masters program while conducting research in biostratigraphy at the Horn Point Environmental Laboratory in Cambridge, Maryland. Upon matriculation, Arnold spent another year working in the Marine Sciences including time at the Cape Cod National Seashore and aboard a sail training/oceanographic vessel headquartered in Woods Hole, Massachusetts. In 1993, Arnold joined the faculty at the Casablanca American School in Casablanca, Morocco, teaching college preparatory Biology and Marine Environmental Science. During that time, he began presenting workshops at various international education conferences focusing on science teaching methodologies. In 1996, he and his family moved to Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, where he was employed as a middle and high school science teacher at the American International School. In 2001, Arnold was hired by International Schools Services to teach middle school mathematics and science at the International School of Kuala Kencana operated by PT Freeport Indonesia in West Papua, Indonesia. In 2003, he accepted a similar teaching position at the American International School of Bucharest in Bucharest, Romania. Arnold was the guest of honor at the Bowie High School Class of 2009 graduation, delivering the commencement speech.\n\n\n== NASA career ==\n\nArnold was selected as a Mission Specialist-Educator by NASA in May 2004. In February 2006 he completed Astronaut Candidate Training that included scientific and technical briefings, intensive instruction in Shuttle and International Space Station systems, physiological training, T-38 flight training, and water and wilderness survival training. Upon completion of his training, Arnold was assigned to the Hardware Integration Team in the Space Station Branch working on technical issues with JAXA hardware. He worked on various technical assignments until he was assigned to the STS-119 spaceflight.\nIn August 2007, Arnold served as an aquanaut during the NEEMO 13 project, an exploration research mission held in Aquarius, the world's only undersea research laboratory. On September 19, 2011, NASA announced that Arnold would participate in the NEEMO 15 mission in October 2011 from the DeepWorker submersible. The DeepWorker is a small submarine used as an underwater stand-in for the Space Exploration Vehicle, which might someday be used to explore the surface of an asteroid. In 2016 Arnold participated in ESA CAVES training in Sardinia (Italy) spending six nights underground simulating a mission exploring another planet.\n\n\n=== STS-119 ===\nArnold participated in two spacewalks during the mission.\nThe first EVA by Steven Swanson and Arnold occurred on March 19, 2009, with a duration of 6 hours 7 minutes. After Canadarm2 was released S6 and moved away, the spacewalkers plugged in power and data cables to connect the new hardware. The two spacewalkers also removed launch locks, stowed a keel pin, removed and jettisoned four thermal covers, and deployed the blanket boxes that hold the solar arrays in place during launch. The first spacewalk was devoted to installing the station's new truss segment and preparing the segment's solar arrays for unfolding on the eighth day of the mission. \nArnold performed his second EVA on March 23, 2009, with Joseph Acaba with a duration of 6 hours 27 minutes, to move one of the station's two Crew and Equipment and Translation Aid - or CETA - carts. The carts were moved to the port side of the station's truss during the previous mission to give the robotic arm's mobile transporter the best possible access to the starboard truss for the installation of the new truss segment and solar arrays. With that work done, one of the carts was moved back to the station's port side, leaving a cart for use on either side of the truss. The CETA-cart also got a new coupler. The EVA also included lubricating the end effector capture snares on the station's robot arm - similar to what was done to the other end on an STS-126 spacewalk in late 2008. This has been proven to prevent the snare from snagging or not returning snugly into its groove inside the latching mechanism.\n\n\n=== Expedition 55/56 ===\n\nIn March 2017, Arnold was assigned to ISS Expeditions 55/56. He launched on Soyuz MS-08 on March 21, 2018.\n\nOn March 29, 2018, Arnold performed his first EVA of the mission, with crewmate Drew Feustel. They installed wireless communications equipment on the station's Tranquility module to enhance payload data processing for the experiment ECOSTRESS (Ecosystem Spaceborne Thermal Radiometer Experiment on Space Station). They also swapped out high-definition video cameras on the port truss of the station's backbone and removed aging hoses from a cooling component on the station's truss. The spacewalk had a duration of 6 hours and 10 minutes, bringing Arnold's cumulative EVA time to over 18 hours.\nArnold returned to Earth on October 4, 2018.\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates public domain material from websites or documents of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.\n\n\n== External links ==\n\"Richard R.

Solovyova was born in Kireyevsk, Tula in Russia and she is known for being one out of the five females chosen to join the Soviet Union's all-female space squad. She is married to a man named Sergei A. Kiselyov. She also has two children named Aleksei and Yelena.Irina Solovyova emerged as a public figure in the midst of the Cold War. The idea to launch the first female flight was conceived by Nikolai Kamanin in 1961. Kamanin convinced Sergey Korolev, former Soviet rocket engineer to consider his idea and half a year later, an agreement was reached to recruit five female cosmonauts. Over 800 women applied for the position, however only fifty-eight were considered. Following the application process, twenty-three women were chosen for the advanced medical screening in Moscow, with Solovyova being one of them. Twenty-four year old Solovyova was approached by the Soviet leaders and offered the position on the space squad.Upon accepting the offer to join the space squad, Solovyova began her training in Star City of the Soviet Union, the home to the Yuri Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Center since the 1960s. The five females chosen to train in Star City on the space squad included Solovyova, Zhanna Yorkina, Tatyana Kuzenetsova, Valentina Ponomareva, and Valentina Tereshkova. Valentina Tereshkova was eventually chosen to fly, and Solovyova became her alternate. Solovyova's replacement and fellow trainee in Star City, Valentina Tereshkova, spent three days in space aboard Vostok 6, and then successfully parachuted to earth. Solovyova's colleague, Tereshkova, went on the receive the Order of Lenin and Hero of the Soviet Union awards, the highest award in the Soviet Union. Although she was mainly needed as back up for Valentina Tereshkova, Solovyova held a great contribution to the beginning of female exploration of space.Solovyova, originally from Ural, was an engineer with a science degree before she was chosen to join the space squad. She attended and graduated from the Sverdlovsk Polytechnic Institute. Solovyova was also a member of the national skydiving team along with her fianc\u00e9 at the time, Sergey Kiselev, who was a skydiving instructor.Solovyova was also selected to have the opportunity to be the first woman to walk in space, however Svetlana Savitskaya ended up being chosen. Before she was chosen to be a cosmonaut, Solovyova was a world champion member of Soviet's national parachutists.\nShe was awarded the Belarusian Order For Service to the Motherland in the Armed Forces, 3rd class.\n\n\n== Education ==\n1959- Graduated from Sverdlovsk Polytechnic Institute with a degree in mechanical engineering\n1967- Graduated from Zhukovsky Air Force Engineering Academy, Monino\n1980- Candidate of psychological sciences degree\n\n\n== Training ==\nIrina Solovyova was a trained civilian cosmonaut. She is a retired Colonel in the Soviet Air Force. She completed cosmonaut training from April 1962 through the 29th of November in 1962 alongside Kuznetsova and Tereshkova. She also became a member of an all-female Antarctic Expedition in February 1988.\n\n\n== Female cosmonaut interview ==\nIn January 1962, DOSAAF (a Russian Volunteer Society for Cooperation with the Army, Aviation, and Navy ) sends a file of 58 female cosmonaut candidates, pilots and parachutists. Of which 40 are to be interviewed to undergo a training at TsPK(cosmonaut training center or Tsentr Podgotovki Kosmonavtov) which will prepare the team for the Flight: Vostok 6. Before Solovyova was contacted, she was a 24 year old engineer in Ural with a science degree who was a part of the skydiving team.\nNikolai Petrovich Kamanin reviews the plans with only 17 cosmonauts for the  TsPK.\nWhen Kamanin & his staff finally interviewed, there were 23 of the 58 female cosmonaut candidates. He was looking for young, physically fit and those undergone flight and parachute training for at least five to six months.\nWith the pool of Soviet female pilots being limited, potential candidates were also sought who were active sport parachutists.\n\n\n== Female cosmonaut training group ==\nA group was selected for the manned space program - Vostok 6 based on the following qualifications: \n\nunder 30 years of age\nunder 170 cm (5' 7\") tall\nunder 70 kg (150 lb)The five Soviet women selected were:  Kuznetsova, Ponomaryova, Solovyova, Tereshkova, Yorkina on 16 February 1962 and reported for training a month later. However, the flight of a woman in space had little support from Chief Designer Korolev or Kamanin's military commanders.\n\n\n=== Training ===\nThe five female cosmonaut group underwent the complete course of cosmonaut training including weightless flights, parachute jumps, isolation tests, centrifuge tests, and academic studies of rocket theory and spacecraft engineering. The women undertook 120 parachute jumps and received pilot training in MiG-15UTI jet trainers.\nIn May 1962 a Soviet delegation, including cosmonaut Gherman Titov and Kamanin, visited Washington. Meeting astronaut John Glenn, they learned of the Mercury 13, a privately funded program where 13 American females were selected by NASA for project Mercury. The female pilots had passed the astronaut physical and were lobbying to be trained as Mercury astronauts. Kamanin learned from Glenn that the first American woman would make a three-orbit Mercury flight by the end of 1962. Seeing the competition, Kamanin decided to move ahead with the first flight of a Soviet women within weeks of his return.\nAt the initial stages of the training, Kamanin places Solovyova in the first ranks as most likely to be first in space.\n\n\n== Future Expedition Involvement ==\nSolovyova was involved in the plans for another expedition in 1965, when Kamanin proposed new missions for the Voskhod system in April of that year. Ponomaryova and Solovyova were proposed for an all-female spacewalk mission, with Ponomaryova as pilot and Solovyova the spacewalker.  The female cosmonauts were informed of the proposed mission, but Kamanin warned them that there might be strong opposition. He was correct. The U.S. Gemini program had just announced a mission that would last 7 to 8 days. In an attempt to maintain their supposed lead in crewed spaceflight, the Soviets planners altered their timetable and the Ponomaryova-Solovyova mission never happened.\n\n\n== References ==", "infobox": {"name": "Irina Solovyova", "birth_date": "{{birth date|df|=|y|1937|9|6}}", "birth_place": "Kireyevsk,Tula", "nationality": "Soviet Union (1937\u20131991)", "known_for": "Cosmonaut", "notable_works": "Soviet Air Force, Civilian Parachutist, One of Five females to be selected for spaceflight program."}, "wikidata": {"occupation (P106)": ["explorer (Q11900058)", "astronaut (Q11631)"], "date of birth (P569)": "+1937-09-06T00:00:00Z", "instance of (P31)": "human (Q5)", "Freebase ID (P646)": "/m/0ggb6mm", "military rank (P410)": "colonel (Q104680)", "award received (P166)": ["Master of Sport of the USSR (Q1803234)", "Pilot-Cosmonaut of the USSR (Q1428575)", "Order \"For Service to the Homeland in the Armed Forces of the USSR\", 3rd class (Q18204156)"], "given name (P735)": "Irina (Q12397773)", "family name (P734)": "Solovyova (Q4428095)", "country of citizenship (P27)": ["Soviet Union (Q15180)", "Russia (Q159)"], "place of birth (P19)": "Tula Oblast (Q2792)", "time in space (P2873)": {"amount": "+0", "unit": "http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q7727"}, "allegiance (P945)": "Soviet Union (Q15180)", "educated at (P69)": "Zhukovsky Air Force Engineering Academy (Q1934904)", "academic degree (P512)": "PhD in Psychology (Q19610208)", "name in native language (P1559)": "\u0418\u0440\u0438\u043d\u0430 \u0411\u0430\u044f\u043d\u043e\u0432\u043d\u0430 \u0421\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0432\u044c\u0435\u0432\u0430", "sex or gender (P21)": "female (Q6581072)", "languages spoken, written or signed (P1412)": "Russian (Q7737)"}, "cat": "Astronauts", "url": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irina_Solovyova", "wikibase": "Q820606"}, {"name": "Jean-Loup Chr\u00e9tien", "url_name": "30876459", "txt": "Jean-Loup Jacques Marie Chr\u00e9tien (born 20 August 1938) is a French retired G\u00e9n\u00e9ral de Brigade (brigadier general) in the Arm\u00e9e de l'Air (French air force), and a former CNES spationaut. He flew on two Franco-Soviet space missions and a NASA Space Shuttle mission. Chr\u00e9tien was the first Frenchman and the first western European in space.\n\n\n== Personal ==\nChr\u00e9tien was born in the town of La Rochelle, France. He was married to and then divorced from Amy Kristine Jensen of New Canaan, Connecticut, and had five children (one deceased).

He was promoted to Lieutenant, and joined the 5th Fighter Wing in Orange, in the Southeast of France, where he served for seven years as a fighter pilot in an operational squadron flying Super-Mystere B2's and then Mirage III interceptors. In 1970, he was assigned to the French test pilots school, EPNER (\u00c9cole du personnel navigant d'essais et de r\u00e9ception), then served as a test pilot at the Istres-Le Tub\u00e9 Air Base for seven years. During that time he was responsible for supervising the flight test program for the Mirage F-1 fighter. In 1977\u20131978, he was appointed Deputy Commander of the South Air Defence Division in Aix-en-Provence, and he served in this position until his selection as a cosmonaut in June 1980. Chr\u00e9tien remained a French Air Force officer but was placed on detachment to CNES for his space flight activities ensuring his availability for future flights with the Space Shuttle (NASA), Mir (Soviet Union) or Spacelab (ESA). He has accumulated over 8000 hours of flying time in various aircraft, including Tupolev-154, MiG-25, and Sukhoi Su-26 and Sukhoi Su-27. A veteran of three space flights, Chr\u00e9tien was the tenth Interkosmos cosmonaut, and has spent a total of 43 days, 11 hours, 18 minutes, 42 seconds in space, including an extra-vehicular activity (EVA) of 5 hours, 57 minutes.\nIn April 1979, the Soviet Union offered France the opportunity to fly a cosmonaut on board a joint Soviet-French space flight, along the same lines as the agreement to fly non-Soviet cosmonauts from member countries of the Interkosmos program. The offer was accepted, and France began a spationaut selection process in September 1979. Chr\u00e9tien was one of two finalists named on 12 June 1980. He started training at the Yuri Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Center in September 1980. The following year, he was named as the Research Cosmonaut for the prime crew of the Soyuz T-6 mission.\nSoyuz T-6 was launched on 24 June 1982, and Chr\u00e9tien, Vladimir Dzhanibekov and Aleksandr Ivanchenkov linked up with Salyut 7 and joined the crew of Anatoli Berezovoy and Valentin Lebedev already on board. They spent nearly seven days carrying out a program of joint Soviet-French experiments, including a series of French echography cardiovascular monitoring system experiments, before returning to Earth after a flight lasting 7 days, 21 hours, 50 minutes, 42 seconds. This flight made him the first Western non-American to go to space, as well as the first Western European.\nFollowing the mission he was appointed Chief, CNES Astronaut Office.\nChr\u00e9tien was selected as the back-up crew member for STS-51-G (Patrick Baudry, another CNES astronaut, flew on that mission). During 1984\u20131985, he participated in mission training at the Johnson Space Center.\nChr\u00e9tien made his second space flight as a Research Cosmonaut on board Soyuz TM-7, which launched on 26 November 1988. Together with Alexander Alexandrovich Volkov and Sergei Krikalev, he linked up with Mir and joined the crew of Vladimir Titov, Musa Manarov and Valeriy Polyakov already on board. They spent 22 days carrying out a program of joint Soviet-French experiments, including a 5-hour and 57 minute EVA by Volkov and Chr\u00e9tien during which the two men installed the French ERA experimental deployable structure and a panel of material samples. In making the EVA, he became the first non-American and non-Soviet to walk in space. In addition, he was the first non-Soviet cosmonaut to make a second space flight aboard a Soviet spacecraft. The mission lasted 24 days, 18 hours, 7 minutes.\nDuring 1990\u20131993, Chr\u00e9tien participated in Buran spacecraft pilot training at the Moscow Joukovski Institute. He has also flown the Tupolev Tu-154 and MiG-25 aircraft, flying simulators equivalent to the Shuttle Training Aircraft (STA).\nIn 1994, he was selected as part of NASA Astronaut Group 15 to officially become an International Mission Specialist with NASA.\nChr\u00e9tien attended ASCAN Training at the Johnson Space Center during 1995. He was initially assigned to work technical issues for the Operations Planning Branch of the Astronaut Office. He served on the crew of STS-86 Atlantis (25 September to 6 October 1997) the seventh mission to rendezvous and dock with the Russian Space Station Mir. Highlights included the delivery of a Mir attitude control computer, the exchange of U.S. crew members Mike Foale and David Wolf, a spacewalk by Scott E. Parazynski and Vladimir Titov to retrieve four experiments first deployed on Mir during the STS-76 docking mission, the transfer to Mir of 4,700 kg (10,400 lb) of science and logistics, and the return of experiment hardware and results to Earth. Mission duration was 10 days, 19 hours, 21 minutes.\nIn September 2000, while visiting a Home Depot store in Webster, Texas, he was hit by a 31 kg (68 lb) drill press that fell from a shelf more than 3 m (9.8 ft) above him. The injuries to his neck, head and shoulders were severe enough that a NASA flight surgeon determined that Chr\u00e9tien could no longer fly. He was forced to retire from the space program in 2001. He filed a US$15 million lawsuit against Home Depot several months after the accident. The company settled the suit in 2002. The terms of the settlement are protected by a confidentiality agreement. Chr\u00e9tien is currently working for Tietronix Software as the vice president of Research and Development in Houston, Texas.\n\n\n== Books ==\nJean-Loup Chr\u00e9tien, Patrick Baudry and Bernard Chabbert, Spatiale premier: the first French in space, Paris, Plon, 1982, 306 p.

She was the first female air safety investigator for the National Transportation Safety Board, the first female civilian flight instructor at Fort Sill, Oklahoma, and the first female Federal Aviation Agency inspector, as well as one of the Mercury 13.Funk became the oldest person to go to space on July 20, 2021 at age 82, flying on Blue Origin's New Shepard spacecraft during its suborbital flight, breaking a record held by John Glenn for 23 years. Her record would stand until later that year when William Shatner's flight took place on October 13; Shatner was age 90 at the time. Funk continues to hold the record for the oldest woman to travel to space.\nTogether with Gene Nora Jessen, Funk is one of the last two surviving members of the Mercury 13 group. She is also the only one of the thirteen to have traveled to space.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nFunk was born in Las Vegas, New Mexico, in 1939 and grew up in Taos, New Mexico. Her parents owned a variety store. The family had a collection of artwork from artists at the Taos art colony, as the artists would trade artwork to pay off their debt at the store.As a child, Funk was captivated by planes. When she was one year old, her parents took her to an airport near where they lived in New Mexico and she got up close to a Douglas DC-3, an early airliner. \"I go right to the wheel and I try to turn the nut,\" she says. \"Mother said: 'She\u2019s going to fly.'\" She became interested in mechanics and built model airplanes and ships. By the time she was seven, she was making planes from balsa wood. At nine, she had her first flying lesson.Funk was also an accomplished outdoorswoman, spending time riding her bike or her horse, skiing, hunting, and fishing. At age 14, she became an expert marksman, receiving the Distinguished Rifleman's Award. The National Rifle Association sent her incredible shooting results to the president, Dwight Eisenhower, and he wrote back to her. At the same time she represented the southwestern United States as Top Female Skier, Slalom and Downhill races in United States competition.\n\n\n== Education and flight school ==\nAs a high school student, Funk wanted to take courses such as mechanical drawing and auto mechanics, but because she was a girl, she was permitted to take only courses such as home economics. Frustrated, Funk left high school early at the age of 16 and entered Stephens College in Columbia, Missouri. Funk became a member of the \"Flying Susies\" and rated first in her class of 24 fliers. She graduated in 1958 with her pilot's license and an Associate of Arts degree.Funk moved on to complete a Bachelor of Science degree in Secondary Education at Oklahoma State University. While at OSU, Funk was a member of Alpha Chi Omega, Gamma Epsilon chapter. Funk was drawn to OSU primarily by its famous \"Flying Aggies\" program. At OSU, Funk earned a large number of aviation certificates and ratings, including her Commercial, Single-engine Land, Multi-engine Land, Single-engine Sea, Instrument, Flight Instructor's, and all Ground Instructor's ratings. Funk was elected as an officer of the \"Flying Aggies\" and flew for them in the International Collegiate Air Meets. She received the \"Outstanding Female Pilot\" trophy, the \"Flying Aggie Top Pilot\" and the \"Alfred Alder Memorial Trophy\" two years in succession.\n\n\n== Aviation career ==\nAt 20 years old, Funk became a professional aviator. Her first job was at Fort Sill, Oklahoma, as a Civilian Flight Instructor of noncommissioned and commissioned officers of the United States Army. Funk was the first female flight instructor at a US military base. In the fall of 1961, she accepted a job as a Certified Flight Instructor, Charter, and Chief Pilot with an aviation company in Hawthorne, California.Funk earned her Airline Transport Rating in 1968, the 58th woman in the U.S. to do so. She applied to three commercial airlines but, like other qualified female pilots, was turned away because of her sex.In 1971, Funk earned the rating of flight inspector from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), becoming the first woman to complete the FAA's General Aviation Operations Inspector Academy course, which includes Pilot Certification and Flight Testing procedures, handling accidents, and violations. She worked for four years with the FAA as a field examiner, the first woman to do so. In 1973 she was promoted to FAA SWAP (Systems Worthiness Analysis Program) as a specialist, the first woman in the United States to hold this position. In late November 1973, Wally again entered the FAA Academy to take courses involving air-taxi, charter, and aviation rental businesses.In 1974, Funk was hired by the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) as its first female Air Safety Investigator. Funk investigated 450 accidents, ranging from a probable mob hit to a fatal crash at a mortuary. She made the discovery that people who die in small-plane crashes often have their jewelry, shoes, and clothes stripped off by the impact.Concurrently, Funk participated in many air races. She placed eighth in the Powder Puff Derby's 25th Annual Race, sixth in the Pacific Air Race, and eighth in the Palms to Pines Air Race. On August 16, 1975, she placed second in the Palms to Pines All Women Air Race from Santa Monica, California, to Independence, Oregon. On October 4, 1975, flying her red and white Citabria, Wally won the Pacific Air Race from San Diego, California, to Santa Rosa, California, against 80 participating competitors.Funk retired from her post as an Air Safety Investigator in 1985 after serving for 11 years. Funk was then appointed an FAA Safety Counselor and became a renowned pilot trainer and speaker on aviation safety. In 1986, she was the key speaker for the US at The World Aviation Education and Safety Congress. In 1987, Funk was appointed Chief Pilot at Emery Aviation College, Greeley, Colorado, overseeing the entire flight programs for 100 students from Private to Multi-engine flight Instructor and Helicopter ratings.\nFunk has been chief pilot for five aviation schools across the country. To date, as a professional Flight Instructor she has soloed more than 700 students and put through 3,000 Private, Commercial, Multi-engine, Seaplane, Glider, Instrument, CFI, Al, and Air Transport Pilots.\n\n\n== Space career ==\n\n\n=== Mercury 13 ===\n\nIn February 1961, Funk volunteered for the \"Women in Space\" Program. The program was run by William Randolph Lovelace, although it lacked official government sponsorship. Funk contacted Lovelace, detailing her experience and achievements. Despite being younger than the recruiting age range of 25\u201340, Funk was invited to take part. Twenty-five women were invited, nineteen enrolled, and thirteen graduated, including Funk, who at 21 was the youngest. On some tests, she scored better than John Glenn. The media dubbed the group the \"Mercury 13\", a reference to the Mercury 7.Like the other participants in the program, Funk was put through rigorous physical and mental testing. In one test, volunteers were placed in sensory deprivation tanks. Funk was in the tank, without hallucinating, for 10 hours and 35 minutes, a record. She passed her tests and was qualified to go into space. Her score was the third best in the Mercury 13 program. Despite this, the program was canceled before the women were to undergo their last test.After the Mercury 13 program was canceled, Funk became a Goodwill Ambassador.\n\n\n=== Later career ===\nFunk continued to dream of going to space.  When NASA finally began accepting women in the late 1970s, Funk applied three times. Despite her impressive credentials, she was turned down for not having an engineering degree or a background as a test pilot.In 1995, Lt. Col. Eileen Collins became the first woman to pilot a Space Shuttle into space; Funk was too old to qualify to become a Space Shuttle pilot by the time Collins became one. Funk and six other members of the Mercury 13 were invited guests of Collins at the launch, and NASA gave them a behind-the-scenes VIP tour of the Kennedy Space Center complex.In 2012, she put money down to be one of the first people to fly into space via Virgin Galactic. The money for the flight came from Funk's own book and film royalties and family money.In July 2020 Funk published a memoir, Higher Faster Longer \u2013 My Life in Aviation and My Quest for Space Flight with author Loretta Hall.\n\n\n=== 2021 suborbital space flight ===\n\nOn July 1, 2021, Blue Origin announced Funk would fly on the first New Shepard flight with passengers, one of four on the flight, including Jeff Bezos, his brother Mark, and 18-year-old Oliver Daemen from the Netherlands, who became the youngest ever person in space during the flight of July 20, 2021. During the successful flight Funk, at age 82, became the oldest person to fly to space, exceeding John Glenn's record at the age of 77 in 1998 (aboard STS-95). Her record would be surpassed later that year by William Shatner, who flew aboard Blue Origin NS-18 at the age of 90.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nFunk currently lives in Grapevine, Texas. She enjoys sports and restoring antique automobiles, with a collection that includes a 1951 Hooper Silver Wraith.She has over 18,600 flight hours and as of June 2019 still flew each Saturday as an instructor.\n\n\n== Popular culture ==\nThe Flight of Wally Funk is a 2001 album by Australian rock band Spiderbait. It peaked at number 34 on the ARIA charts.Wally Funk is the title of the 11th track on Pleasure Seekers, the 2022 album by The Electric Swing Circus.\n\n\n== Awards and honors ==\nIn 1964, Funk became the youngest woman in the history of Stephens College to receive the Alumna Achievement Award, honored in recognition for her work in aviation.\nIn 1965, Funk was selected as one of the Outstanding Young Women in America, \"in recognition of her outstanding ability, accomplishments and service to her community, country and profession\".\nIn 2012, filmed her life story for the Traveling Space Museum.\nIn 2017, Wally Funk's name was inscribed on the Smithsonian National Air & Space Museum's Wall of Honor \"in recognition of your contribution to our aviation and exploration heritage\".\nIn 2022, Funk was awarded the R.A.\"Bob\" Hoover trophy by the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association, for exhibiting \u201cthe airmanship, leadership, mentorship, and passion for aviation\u201d that Hoover exemplified, as well as for having a \u201cdistinguished career as a pilot and aviation advocate while also serving as a source of inspiration and encouragement for current and prospective aviators.\u201d\nFunk is listed in \"Who's Who in Aviation\".\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nWally Funk profile from the Ninety-Nines, Inc., International Organization of Women Pilots", "infobox": {"name": "Wally Funk", "image": "Wally Funk 2012.jpg", "caption": "Funk in 2012", "birth_date": "{{birth date and age|1939|2|1}}", "birth_place": "[[Las Vegas, New Mexico]], U.S.", "alma_mater": "[[Stephens College]] [[Oklahoma State University]]", "known_for": "First female FAA and NTSB inspector; one of the [[Mercury 13]]; oldest woman to fly in space.", "module": "{{Infobox astronaut| embed|=|yes\n| type          |=| Commercial Astronaut<br />[[File:US - FAA Astronaut Wings version 2.png|150px]]\n| selection     |=| [[Blue Origin]]\n| flight_time   |=| 10m 18s\n| missions      |=| [[Blue Origin NS-16|NS-16]]\n| insignia      |=|}}"}, "wikidata": {"instance of (P31)": "human (Q5)", "sex or gender (P21)": "female (Q6581072)", "image (P18)": "Seven Members of the First Lady Astronaut Trainees in 1995 - GPN-2002-000196-crop.jpg", "occupation (P106)": ["aircraft pilot (Q2095549)", "inspector (Q27214348)", "flight instructor (Q379318)", "astronaut (Q11631)"], "given name (P735)": ["Mary (Q734578)", "Wallace (Q2542509)"], "country of citizenship (P27)": "United States of America (Q30)", "date of birth (P569)": "+1939-01-31T00:00:00Z", "place of birth (P19)": "Las Vegas (Q676171)", "award received (P166)": ["Women in Aviation, International (Q8031408)", "honorary doctorate (Q11415564)"], "Commons category (P373)": "Wally Funk", "educated at (P69)": ["Stephens College (Q12070051)", "Oklahoma State University\u2013Stillwater (Q749718)"], "part of (P361)": "Mercury 13 (Q1517045)", "nickname (P1449)": "Wally", "family name (P734)": "Funk (Q1355692)", "Freebase ID (P646)": "/m/0w1fbmb", "member of the crew of (P5096)": "Blue Origin NS-16 (Q107483347)", "Library of Congress authority ID (P244)": "no2019061897", "VIAF ID (P214)": "91155707114222412984", "birth name (P1477)": "Mary Wallace Funk", "Podchaser creator ID (P9743)": "107a9Gfuwp", "significant event (P793)": "sub-orbital spaceflight (Q832435)", "official website (P856)": "https://wallyfly.com/", "IMDb ID (P345)": "nm9771397", "TMDb person ID (P4985)": "2028518"}, "cat": "Astronauts", "url": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wally_Funk", "wikibase": "Q16213049"}, {"name": "Francisco Rubio", "url_name": "54253195", "txt": "Francisco Carlos \"Frank\" Rubio (born December 11, 1975) is a US Army major and helicopter pilot, flight surgeon, and NASA astronaut.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nFrancisco Rubio was born on December 11, 1975, in Los Angeles, California, to Salvadoran parents.

The tower's architecture and engineering were performed by Skidmore, Owings & Merrill with Adrian D. Smith and Gordon Gill (now at their own firm, AS+GG) as architects. Ground broke on the tower on 8 September 2006 and construction was completed in March 2011. It is intended for office use and is partially occupied by the China National Tobacco Corporation.\n\n\n== Architecture and design ==\nThe design of the Pearl River Tower is intended to minimise harm to the environment and it will extract energy from the natural and passive forces surrounding the building. Major accomplishments are the technological integration of form and function in a holistic approach to engineering and architectural design.\n\n\n=== Sustainability ===\n\n\n==== Energy-Saving Strategies ====\nThere were four steps in the approach to the Pearl River Tower's high-performance design: reduction, absorption, reclamation, and generation. These steps were put in place to achieve the goal of being a zero-energy building.\n1. Reduction \u2013 This includes using low discharge ventilation, daylight responsive controls, radiant cooling, demand-based ventilation, and high-performance glazing.\n2. Absorption \u2013 This includes using wind turbines, daylight responsive controls, and integrated Photovoltaics.\n3. Reclamation \u2013 This stage includes using exhaust air heat recovery and chillers.\n4. Generation \u2013 This final stage works to achieve the objective of being a zero-energy building by creating sufficient energy on-site through the use of microturbines.\n\n\n==== Wind Turbines ====\nThe Pearl River Tower's design enables it to funnel wind through four large wind turbines to generate up to 15 times more energy than regular freestanding turbines.\nAlongside creating the power required for the building to operate, another benefit to this design is that the wind is re-routed through the tower's ventilation system, filtering it through the ceiling and floor spaces throughout the building.  \nAs well as being designed to tunnel the wind in the most efficient way, the tower was built so its widest side faces the direction of the wind, allowing it to capture the most wind possible and thus generate the most energy.Winds in Guangzhou are relatively predictable, coming from the south for 80% of the year and coming from the north for the remaining 20%. This meant that the wind turbines' success could be maximized by considering the building's wind loads. To make the most of the prevailing wind direction, it was essential to place the building's broadest face at a perpendicular angle to the prevailing wind.\n\n\n==== Turbine Usage ====\nThe building was designed to generate power as efficiently as possible. To achieve this goal, the Pearl River Tower was built to direct incoming wind into vents that lead to its turbines. Explicitly sculpted to guide wind into the turbines, this 71-story building works to ensure there is almost always clean energy being generated.\n\n\n==== Cooling ====\nDue to Guangzhou's climate, cooling is an essential part of keeping those within the building comfortable. As the heat increases to higher temperatures in the warmer months, the radiant ceiling system works to cool the office spaces. Another part of the cooling system design is the use of cladding on the broad faces of the building. Using cavities in the walls to trap hot air from the building's exterior, the air runs through the raised floor system and pushes the heat to specific areas where it can be collected and used effectively.\n\n\n==== High-Efficiency Lighting ====\nTo avoid unnecessary energy expenditure, artificial lighting is only used in the building when necessary. When used, the highest-efficiency light bulbs on the market provide lighting for the building without requiring large amounts of electricity to function. The ceiling panels are built in a curved shape to allow the light to be dispersed evenly throughout the rooms, reducing the amount of power needed to light a given space fully.\n\n\n==== Solar Heat ====\nThe Pearl River Tower has advanced double glazing that allows natural light to enter the building. There is a double-skin fa\u00e7ade in place, meaning the walls have two layers: the outer skin has a high permeability for solar heat to allow it in, while the inner skin prevents solar gain. This is referred to as a double curtain wall. There is a ventilation corridor between the two layers. The layers automatically adjust to allow heat in or out as required. The result of this design is that the building is more thermochemically efficient. It helps keep the building at the desired temperature regardless of the weather without using large amounts of energy to pump artificially created hot or cold air into the building.The heat that is trapped between the two skins rises, creating natural ventilation. Initially, the building design aimed to create a positive-energy building, meaning it would generate excess power that could be sold to the electrical grid. Complications with fire codes and regulations resulted in the original design being amended. In its final state, the 212,165m\u00b2 building uses around 40% of the energy that a building of its size would typically use.\n\n\n==== Triple Glazing ====\nThe glass on the exterior of the building has three layers of glazing applied to it. This glazing traps heat within the building, keeping it warmer during the winter. If the heat becomes excessive, it is easily vented out using the tower's built wind-powered ventilation system.\n\n\n==== Photovoltaic Cells ====\nThe shading system on the exterior of the tower has photovoltaic cells incorporated in its design. The purpose of these cells is to absorb solar energy, much like the panels on the top of the tower. This has the effect of increasing the tower's ability to power itself with clean energy by reducing the need for it to draw from the local power grid. This adds to the tower's already considerable power-saving capabilities caused by the wind and solar power used in other parts of the building.\n\n\n==== Reused Heating ====\nWhen coolers are used for air conditioning, the hot water created as a byproduct is then used throughout the building. This reduces water demands and makes the building more sustainable overall.\n\n\n==== Daylight Responsive Blinds ====\nThe blinds on the tower's exterior automatically open or close depending on the building's lighting needs. This maximizes the amount of light inside the building when needed while preventing an excess of light from blinding those insides. This is consistent with other sustainable, efficient aspects of the tower's design, as it prevents excessive artificial light usage and, in turn, prevents unnecessary power draw.\n\n\n=== Influence ===\nThe Pearl River Tower is one of the most environmentally friendly buildings in the world.Of Pearl River Tower\u2019s accomplishments, many are related to the sustainable design features include:\n\nThe largest radiant-cooled office building in the world\nMost energy efficient super-tall building in the world\nThe tower is an example of China\u2019s goal to reduce the intensity of carbon dioxide emissions per unit of GDP in 2020 by 40 to 45 percent as compared to the level of 2005.In a report presented at the 2008 Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat it was reported that the building's sustainable design features will allow a 58% energy usage reduction when compared to similar stand alone buildings.  The building would have been able to be carbon neutral and actually sell power back to the surrounding neighborhood if the micro-turbines had been installed into the building.  However the local power company in Guangzhou does not allow independent energy producers to sell electricity back to the grid.  Without the financial incentive to add the micro-turbines the developers removed them from the design.  If they had been added excess power would have been produced from the building, at the very least, after office hours when the power needed by the building itself had been reduced.\n\n\n=== Timeline ===\nFall 2005 : Design Competition\n8 September  2006 : Ground Breaking Ceremony\nNovember 2006 : Enabling Works begin\n18 July 2007 : Public bidding for the construction\nJanuary 2008 : Main Package construction begins \u221226.2 m (\u221286 ft)\nAugust 2008 : Building Core construction reaches ground level 0 m (0 ft)\nApril 2009 : 15th Level 80.6 m (264 ft)\nNovember 2009: Glass curtainwall installation begins\nDecember 2009: Building reaches upper wind turbine level\n28 March 2010: Topped-out\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nSOM's Pearl River Tower Page\nAS+GG's Pearl River Tower Page\nConsulting Services performed by RWDI", "infobox": {"name": "Pearl River Tower", "native_name": "\u73e0\u6c5f\u57ce\u5927\u53a6", "native_name_lang": "zh", "image": "\u82b1\u57ce\u6c47 \u97f3\u4e50\u55b7\u6cc9 (2013-10-26) - panoramio PRT (cropped).jpg", "image_size": "200px", "image_caption": "Pearl River Tower in October 2013", "alternate_name": "Guangdong Tobacco Building", "location": "Zhujiang Avenue West <br>[[Guangzhou]], [[People's Republic of China|China]]", "coordinates": "{{coord|23.12675|113.3176|region:CN-44|display|=|inline,title}}", "status": "Complete", "start_date": "28 September 2006", "completion_date": "March 2011", "building_type": "Commercial offices", "architectural_style": "[[Neo-futurism]]", "roof": "{{convert|309.6|m|abbr|=|on}}", "floor_count": "71 <small>(+5 basement floors)</small>", "elevator_count": "29", "floor_area": "{{convert|212165|m2|abbr|=|on}}", "architect": "[[Adrian Smith + Gordon Gill Architecture|Gordon Gill]] <br>[[Skidmore, Owings & Merrill]]<br>Guangzhou Chengzong Design Institute", "structural_engineer": "[[Skidmore, Owings & Merrill]]", "main_contractor": "[[Shanghai Construction Group]]", "developer": "Abu Zayyad Holdings .", "owner": "[[China National Tobacco Corporation]]"}, "wikidata": {"Commons category (P373)": "Pearl River Tower", "coordinate location (P625)": {"latitude": 23.12666667, "longitude": 113.3175, "altitude": null, "precision": 0.00027777777777778, "globe": "http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q2"}, "Freebase ID (P646)": "/m/026rkyy", "country (P17)": "People's Republic of China (Q148)", "instance of (P31)": "high-rise building (Q18142)", "architect (P84)": "Adrian Smith + Gordon Gill Architecture (Q4685364)", "image (P18)": "PearlRiverTower Jan.jpg", "structural engineer (P631)": "Skidmore Owings Merrill (Q459464)", "main building contractor (P193)": "Shanghai Construction Group (Q15528181)", "owned by (P127)": "China Tobacco (Q1003789)", "VIAF ID (P214)": "253057722", "CTBUH Skyscraper Center building ID (P1305)": "454", "located in the administrative territorial entity (P131)": "Guangzhou (Q16572)", "Emporis building ID (P455)": "275364", "SkyscraperPage building ID (P1699)": "33679", "number of elevators (P1301)": {"amount": "+29", "unit": "1"}, "Structurae structure ID (P454)": "20058652", "architectural style (P149)": "neo-futurism (Q17012219)", "height (P2048)": {"amount": "+309.6", "unit": "http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q11573"}, "inception (P571)": "+2011-00-00T00:00:00Z", "floors above ground (P1101)": {"amount": "+71", "unit": "1"}, "floors below ground (P1139)": {"amount": "+5", "unit": "1"}}, "cat": "Building", "url": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearl_River_Tower", "wikibase": "Q249319"}, {"name": "Waste House", "url_name": "47834322", "txt": "Waste House is a building on the University of Brighton campus in the centre of Brighton on the south coast of England.

The building has won several awards and was shortlisted for the Royal Institute of British Architects' Stephen Lawrence Prize in September 2015.\n\n\n== Background ==\nWaste House has its origins in an earlier project by Duncan Baker-Brown, a senior lecturer at the university and a director of architecture firm BBM Sustainable Design based at Cooksbridge railway station in East Sussex.  On Channel 4 television programme Grand Designs, he and designer and television presenter Kevin McCloud assembled a \"low-energy ... ecologically friendly\" prefabricated house made of organic materials.  It was the first such building to be constructed in the United Kingdom.  Baker-Brown was responsible for the design of this building, which was in turn referred to as \"The House that Kevin Built\".  Originally Baker-Brown planned simply to take down the building and re-erect it at the University.  Instead, the temporary building formed the prototype for Waste House, and since 2008 work has been undertaken at the University of Brighton Faculty of Arts to develop the ideas and techniques used on the programme in order to build a permanent house which can be used to test materials, construction theories and new techniques.  It is intended to be \"a real live research project\" as well as a building which the university and other groups can use.\n\n\n== Design and construction ==\nWork was planned to begin in 2012 in time for an end-of-year completion date and a public opening in February 2013.  These dates were not achieved, but preparation started on 26 November 2012 and by May 2013 construction was underway.  Work finished in April 2014, the building was featured as part of the Brighton Festival the following month, the public were able to view the interior during June 2014, and by August 2014 Waste House was complete.  Construction cost \u00a3140,000 and the total value of the contract was \u00a3200,000.  Waste House is the first permanent public building in Europe made from waste material.Over 300 students from the University of Brighton, City College Brighton & Hove (CCB) and apprentices from housing provider Mears Group were involved in the project.  The construction work was mainly undertaken by CCB students, the Mears apprentices and some volunteers, led by a project manager from Mears Group.  Students learning carpentry at CCB designed the timber-framed structure and the \"fine timber staircase, finished with a decorative flourish of offcuts\".  Many of the structural elements were created in the college's own workshops.  University of Brighton Faculty of Arts students worked with Baker-Brown on the design, the selection of materials and on interior features such as furniture.  Overall, 97.5% of the time taken to build Waste House\u20142,507 person-days\u2014was provided by students and volunteers, and about 700 people worked on the project.  A major aim of the project was to introduce students and apprentices to sustainable building techniques and to allow them to continue testing their ideas by retrofitting new fixtures.\n\n\n== Materials ==\nThe purpose of building Waste House was to demonstrate that material considered to be waste, and therefore destined for landfill, could be used to create a viable permanent building.  Baker-Brown stated that in the United Kingdom, 20% of construction materials go to waste\u2014so the equivalent of one house worth of unwanted material is generated for every five houses built.  Between 85% and 90% of the materials used in Waste House are building waste of this type or ordinary household and consumer products which are no longer needed.\n\nStructurally, the building is timber-framed and uses a mixture of reclaimed wood and plywood from various sources around Brighton.  It has been constructed on foundations of ground granulated blast-furnace slag.  The \"rather unusual\" walls consist of a mixture of waste chalk and clay left over or reclaimed from building sites.  These are compressed into rammed earth-style walls using pneumatic equipment\u2014a technique which improves the building's energy conservation, because such walls store solar energy for a long time.  On the outside the walls are covered with \"a scaly surface of rubbery black shingles\"\u20142,000 carpet tiles from an old office building in Brighton.  Their fire-retardant, waterproof underlay faces outwards, providing weatherproof cladding and insulation.  Their mostly black appearance is varied in places by being laminated with plastic bags in various colours.  Between the carpet tiles and the walls themselves, some new material was used: DuPont supplied about 400 square metres (4,300 sq ft) of \"breathable membrane\", to further weatherproof the building, and \"Housewrap\" moisture seal.  Inside, the walls are laid with reclaimed plasterboard coated with surplus paint from construction sites.  The main load-bearing wall is formed of 10 tonnes of compressed chalk spoil from a building site nearby.  Throughout the building, the space between the boarding and the exterior clay and chalk blocks has been filled with household rubbish which will act as insulation.  Sensors have been installed to monitor how well heat is kept in, which will form part of a PhD project for a University of Brighton student.  The insulation materials are revealed in various places by \"little peephole windows\" (transparent panels in the walls): as well as some secondhand conventional (polyurethane) insulation material, there are floppy disks, 4,000 VHS cassettes, 4,000 DVD and video cases, two tonnes of denim offcuts from pairs of jeans and denim jackets, cycle inner tubes to insulate windows, and 20,000 toothbrushes.  The cassettes and other media came from the stock of rental shops which were closing down; an aeroplane cleaning company at nearby Gatwick Airport donated most of the toothbrushes, which were provided to First and Business Class passengers and discarded after one use, and some others were provided by Brighton schoolchildren; and the denim came from textile traders (in particular, one company which turned imported jeans into denim shorts by cutting off the legs).Many materials were obtained on the Freegle website\u2014a free reuse and recycling service developed from The Freecycle Network.  These include the clay tiles on the roof, the kitchen and some of the insulation material.  Cat Fletcher, one of the founders of Freegle UK, was part of the Waste House project team and was responsible for obtaining many of the materials, both from Freegle members (numbering 18,000 in the Brighton area) and from other sources.  Other than the specialist cladding materials supplied by DuPont, the only new products used in the building are the triple-glazed windows and the material used in the wiring and plumbing.\n\n\n== Awards and reception ==\nIn September 2015, Waste House was nominated for that year's Stephen Lawrence Prize.  This Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA) award, named after the aspiring architect who was murdered in 1993, is for projects with a budget of up to \u00a31 million.  In its shortlisting for the award, which was judged in mid-October 2015, judges from the RIBA stated that the house \"has sufficient scientific integrity to be taken seriously by the construction industry\" and the potential to alter political attitudes to recycling.  Waste House was one of seven buildings nominated for the prize, which was won by a fishing hut designed by Niall McLaughlin Architects.Waste House was one of several buildings in Sussex, along with the Chichester Festival Theatre and St Botolph's Church at Botolphs, to win an award at the RIBA South East Regional Awards in April 2015.  It was described as \"a project with an interesting agenda\" and \"a collective of experiments in which students learn by application\".  Duncan Baker-Brown also won an Argus Achievement Award from local newspaper The Argus.RIBA awarded Waste House a Sustainability Award in 2014.  It described \"some of the experiments [as] extraordinary\", commenting specifically on the toothbrush insulation and the vinyl banner vapour control layers, and noted that \"the continually evolving [design] brief\" would \"continue to question important issues of recycling that affect everyone\".The 2Degrees Network, a worldwide collaborative association of sustainable businesses, awarded the building a Champions Award in 2014.  Waste House was described as \"an investment in educating the next generation of designers and builders to think and build more sustainably\".In view of its low energy use, Waste House has a building energy rating of A.  When work started, Baker-Brown stated the aim of making it one of the United Kingdom's first A*-rated buildings.\n\n\n== See also ==\nBuildings and architecture of Brighton and Hove\nSustainable architecture\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Waste House, Brighton at Wikimedia Commons", "infobox": {"name": "Waste House", "status": "complete", "image": "Waste House, University of Brighton, Grand Parade, Brighton (September 2015) (17).JPG", "caption": "The building from the south-southeast", "map_type": "United Kingdom Brighton", "map_caption": "Location in central [[Brighton]]", "architectural_style": "[[Contemporary architecture|Contemporary]] ([[Sustainable architecture|Sustainable]])", "cost": "\u00a3140,000", "owner": "[[University of Brighton]]", "address": "[[University of Brighton Faculty of Arts]], 58\u201367 Grand Parade, [[Brighton]] BN2&nbsp;0JY", "location_town": "[[Brighton and Hove]]", "location_country": "United Kingdom", "coordinates": "{{coord|50.823547|-0.134809|display|=|inline,title}}", "groundbreaking_date": "26 November 2012", "start_date": "May 2013", "completion_date": "April 2014", "opening_date": "10 June 2014", "floor_count": "2", "main_contractor": "[[Mears Group]]", "architect": "Duncan Baker-Brown", "architecture_firm": "BBM Sustainable Design"}, "wikidata": {"country (P17)": "United Kingdom (Q145)", "instance of (P31)": "building (Q41176)", "owned by (P127)": "University of Brighton (Q3056813)", "made from material (P186)": "carpet tile (Q2404195)", "Commons category (P373)": "Waste House, Brighton", "image (P18)": "Waste House, University of Brighton, Grand Parade, Brighton (September 2015) (17).JPG", "coordinate location (P625)": {"latitude": 50.82354736, "longitude": -0.134809, "altitude": null, "precision": 1e-06, "globe": "http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q2"}, "floors above ground (P1101)": {"amount": "+2", "unit": "1"}, "located in the administrative territorial entity (P131)": "Brighton and Hove (Q1022488)", "inception (P571)": "+2014-04-00T00:00:00Z", "street address (P6375)": "58\u201367 Grand Parade", "postal code (P281)": "BN2 0JY", "has quality (P1552)": "sustainable architecture (Q185035)", "occupant (P466)": "University of Brighton Faculty of Arts (Q86015343)", "significant event (P793)": "groundbreaking (Q1068633)", "cost (P2130)": {"amount": "+140000", "unit": "http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q25224"}, "main building contractor (P193)": "Mears Group (Q19903450)", "historic county (P7959)": "Sussex (Q23346)", "Atlas Obscura identifier (P7772)": "brighton-waste-house", "Google Knowledge Graph ID (P2671)": "/g/11b8_yzqjt"}, "cat": "Building", "url": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waste_House", "wikibase": "Q21062063"}, {"name": "ENERPOS", "url_name": "39308049", "txt": "ENERPOS is the first educational net-zero energy building in the tropics and one of the 13 Net ZEBs in the tropics thanks to its bioclimatic design. Its name comes from the French \"\u00e9nergie positive\" (\"positive energy\" in English). ENERPOS is located on R\u00e9union Island, a French territory in the Indian Ocean. Building an energy-efficient building in such a climate is particularly challenging, but the energy expectations with regard to ENERPOS have been reached, even largely exceeded. ENERPOS is not only an energy-efficient building but also displays various passive methods to reduce energy consumption while providing a comfortable environment for its users. Classes are hosted for both undergraduate diploma and degree courses as well as for the Department of Construction and Energy at the Graduate Engineering School of R\u00e9union Island.\n\n\n== Location ==\nENERPOS is a university building located in Saint-Pierre on the French island of La R\u00e9union. This island, whose climate is hot and humid, is located in the Indian Ocean, to the east of Madagascar. This area is also often struck by tropical cyclones, generating building difficulties.\n\n\n== Context of R\u00e9union Island ==\nOver 800,000 inhabitants of R\u00e9union Island rely on a limited supply of energy. In addition to that, electricity production on R\u00e9union  Island is one of the most polluting on earth, mainly generated from fossil fuels such as coal and fuel. The electricity produced is expensive and is one of the most polluting in the world with 820 grams (29 oz) of CO2 produced with every kilowatt hour (close to eight times more than in mainland France). Unfortunately, the ever-increasing demand for energy, due to significant demographic growth, sometimes exceeds the amount of energy available. As a consequence, shortages can occur certain times during austral summers when air conditioning is widely used.\nAs is the case in other parts of the world, the electricity consumption of buildings represents a significant percentage of the energy used on R\u00e9union Island. Buildings in French Tropical zones, and especially on R\u00e9union Island, have often been awkwardly designed, contrary to former Creole vernacular architecture, importing metropolitan building concepts. Indeed, it has been common practice to build as cheaply as possible for decades, without any consideration for the environment and the climate, making it uncomfortable to live in without air conditioning. Moreover, air conditioning and lighting are usually oversized by designers, this leads to wasteful energy consumption.\nThe good news is that considerable improvements can be made in reducing energy consumption in the field of building on R\u00e9union Island.\n\n\n== Goal and achievements ==\nUnder the general context of energy supply and consumption on R\u00e9union Island, this building was expected to be net-zero energy and to export at least as much energy as its consumption to the polluting electricity grid of the island. To achieve this goal, the first issue to be addressed is the energy consumption of the building and how to build without using air conditioning, a considerable consumer, while providing a comfortable environment for the users. Air conditioning is only used in one-third of the total surface area for computers and servers, the remaining two-thirds are cooled and ventilated naturally. Passive methods are used, requiring people to be active instead of being passive in an active building (Fran\u00e7ois Garde, Ph.D., P.E. and ASHRAE member). At the beginning of the design of ENERPOS in 2005, the main aim was to demonstrate that the overall consumption of the building could be reduced by three times compared to that of a standard building. The result is that only one-seventh of the annual energy consumption of a standard building is used \u2013 14 kilowatt-hours per square metre (4.7 MJ/sq ft) instead of 100 kWh/m2 (33 MJ/sq ft) in a year. To compensate for this, photovoltaic panels are implemented over the rooftops, enabling the production of 71,118 kilowatt-hours (256,020 MJ) in 2010 compared to an overall consumption of 9,824 kWh (35,370 MJ), making this building one of the 13 Net ZEBs in a tropical climate. Saint Pierre is usually sunny all year and receives a heavy amount of solar radiation with up to 1.2 kilowatts per square metre (0.15 hp/sq ft) in summer. Consequently, the building consumes 7 times less energy than its production, the extra production of electricity being released into the grid.\nENERPOS meets the requirements of the following two performance labels, HQE and PERENE. PERENE is a local label in R\u00e9union Island guiding those wishing to abide by it on how to build in harmony with the corresponding climate (four different classifications are defined depending mainly on the altitude), Saint Pierre being in the hottest zone of the island.\n\n\n== Principles and features ==\n\n\n=== Natural cross ventilation ===\nHuman comfort depends on five criteria, two of which concern one\u2019s clothing and metabolism, and three others which focus on air temperature, air humidity and airflow speed. The faster the airflow is on someone the cooler he feels. Moreover, natural ventilation brings sound fresh air into the building when well-designed. Thus, natural ventilation tends to increase comfort as well as health in tropical climates and aims to suppress air conditioning.\nThe building has been orientated to prevent strong East-South-East trade winds from entering the rooms in winter and still benefit from thermal breezes in summer. The main fa\u00e7ades are then orientated North and South, reducing the heat gain on the Western and Southern fa\u00e7ades (which are more exposed to solar radiation) at the same time.\n\nSuccessful ventilation has been obtained by creating a window to wall ratio of 30% using louvres on both opposite sides of the rooms. Louvres are not only useful to regulate the airflow but also to protect against cyclones and break-ins. In addition to that, the surroundings of the building have been well-thought-out to prevent the ground from heating before entering the rooms:\n\nPlanting native plants and trees in the patio and around the building to create a microclimate which is as fresh as possible.\nPlacing car parks under the building instead of next to it for the same reason. Furthermore, it increases soil permeability so that tropical rains do not cause floods but penetrate the ground.Finally, large ceiling fans are installed in every room, even those using air conditioning. Ceiling fans ensure that even in the absence of the necessary breezes, the airflow needed to feel comfortable in the room is provided for the users. This solution significantly reduces the amount of energy consumed. The overall consumption of the ceiling fans and the split system (the latter used to cool the technical rooms) is only 3.7 kilowatt-hours per square metre (1.2 MJ/sq ft) per year compared to a classic air conditioning system in a standard building consuming 80 kWh/m (88 MJ/ft) per year.\n\n\n=== Solar shading ===\n\nNow that the airflow parameter has been dealt with, the next issue to be addressed is air temperature. Most of the heat gained in the rooms is due to solar radiation coming through the glazing.\nBarely any glazing has been placed on the Western and Eastern small fa\u00e7ades because they are the most likely to receive solar radiation. The two main fa\u00e7ades, including the louvres, are protected against direct sun rays thanks to vertical solar shading composed of inclined wooden strips. To be as efficient as possible, solar shading has been simulated with 3-D software. This glazing protection has two main effects: to prevent glare on the desks, which can be very annoying for the students and the employees working in ENERPOS; and to decrease indoor temperature.\n\n\n=== Materials ===\nConcerning the envelope, the walls are made of concrete; the roofing is insulated with a 10-centimetre (3.9 in) layer of polystyrene and a ventilated BIPV (Building Integrated Photovoltaic) over-roof; the solar shading systems are made of wooden strips; the east and west gables are insulated with mineral wood and wooden cladding. The paint used is completely organic and the wooden components have not undergone any specific treatment. No insulation is required on the main facades as they are very efficient in terms of S-value due to the solar shading.\n\n\n=== Lighting ===\nDaylighting has also been simulated to ensure a Useful Daylight Index (UDI) of at least 90% in most places. Two classrooms facing the sea on the first floor of the building do not have any artificial lighting. Except for those two classrooms, all classrooms and offices are lit by low energy consumption lights producing an artificial lighting density inferior to that of a standard building, 7 watts per square metre (0.00087 hp/sq ft) in the classrooms with low energy T-5 lights and 3.7 W/m2 (0.00046 hp/sq ft) in the offices with personal LED desks lamps. These lighting densities are high enough to make these workplaces comfortable to work in and yet reduce both the energy consumption and the thermal heat gain produced by the lights in so far as is possible.\nThere are multiple switches to control the lights and ceiling fans by the rows of tables in the classrooms since some people could feel hot or do not have enough light while others are comfortable. This avoids wasting electricity.\nA Building Management System is used to control the active systems. In the event of people forgetting to turn off the light when leaving a room, a timer will turn off lights automatically after two hours.\n\n\n=== Computing ===\nThis is similar to the lighting issue as computing systems can affect both energy consumption and thermal heat gain greatly. The main solution adopted in the offices is to use laptops rather than desktop computers since they usually consume less electricity. As for the computer rooms, they are only equipped with screens, mice and keyboards and all central units are located in the air-conditioned technical room. The thermal loads from the computers are thus kept outside the computing rooms.\n\n\n=== Photovoltaic production ===\n\nAs previously explained is, the city of Saint Pierre receives a huge amount of solar radiation throughout the year. This natural source of energy has consequently been exploited. The target is to make ENERPOS a positive energy building thanks to solar panels, the PV production must be at least equal to the energy consumption of the building.\nSince the photovoltaic panels have been used as an over-roof, the overall surface of the panels has been oversized compared to the energy needs to protect the whole roof from direct sun rays. The low energy consumption of ENERPOS is more than balanced by 365 square metres (3,930 sq ft) of these integrated solar panels, generating a total production of 71,118 kilowatt-hours (256,020 MJ) over one year. The resulting surplus of energy, not being consumed by the building but released into the grid instead, is then up to 61 kilowatt-hours (220 MJ) in a year.\nFurthermore, all of the costs and risks of this installation are provided by the manufacturer, as agreed in the contract, and not by the owner of ENERPOS (that is to say the University of R\u00e9union Island). In exchange, the University of R\u00e9union Island rents the photovoltaic production to the manufacturer who receives the benefit of the electricity fed into the grid for 15 years. After that period, the owner of the building becomes the owner of the PV panels.\n\n\n== Making the users active ==\nThe energy consumption of a building not only relies on the way it has been built but also mainly on occupant behaviour. This idea is all the more true for buildings being constructed based on passive designs. Indeed, making ENERPOS a passive building implies that people need to be active to use it to its full capacity.\nFor example, before turning on the ceiling fans of a classroom, the students have to open the louvres first. It seems to be common sense but as a matter of fact, people do not think about that most of the time. That is why signs are displayed in the rooms explaining how to use a classroom properly to avoid wasting energy. The purpose is to educate students (and teachers) about the way to behave and to make them realize the environmental issues at stake on R\u00e9union Island.\n\n\n== Post-occupancy evaluation ==\nSince ENERPOS is a pioneer project on R\u00e9union Island and in the tropics, it is essential to analyze the consumption distribution, the performance and how people feel in this building. Therefore, a post-occupancy evaluation has been carried out for three hot seasons to assess the comfort level in ENERPOS. Students and teachers were asked to fill in a questionnaire about how they feel in the building while environmental parameters, such as temperatures, humidity and air velocity, were collected.\nThe main conclusion is that out of 700 students surveyed, the vast majority feel comfortable in ENERPOS in the hot season without any air conditioning. The ultimate objective of this project has then been met.\n\n\n== Results ==\nAmong the annual 14.4 kilowatt-hours per square metre (4.8 MJ/sq ft) consumption of ENERPOS, the energy end uses are listed in the table.\nThe contribution of the plug loads to the overall energy consumption is abnormally high compared to a standard building because the air conditioning and lighting parts have been well reduced.\nTo conclude, the ENERPOS building shows that it is possible to build an educational Net ZEB in the tropics while providing a comfortable environment for people to work and study in. Moreover, the lessons learnt about the ENERPOS project can be applied to green building and Net ZEB projects in hot climates.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nAutonomous buildings\nBuilding-integrated photovoltaics\nCategory:Low-energy building\nEnergy conservation\nGreen building\nHome energy monitor\nPlug load\nSustainable design\nNet-zero energy building\n\n\n== References ==\nhttp://www.hpbmagazine.org/case-studies/educational/university-of-la-reunions-enerpos-saintpierre-la-reunion-france\nhttp://www.nxtbook.com/nxtbooks/ashrae/hpb_2012summer/\n\n\n== External links ==\nUniversity of Reunion Island\nESIROI\nInstitute of technology\nPiment laboratory", "infobox": {"name": "ENERPOS", "image": "Enerpos1ciel.jpg", "map_type": "R\u00e9union", "map_alt": "Location within R\u00e9union", "etymology": "[[French language|French]]: {{underline|\u00c9ner}} gie {{underline|pos}} itive", "building_type": "Educational", "location": "[[Saint-Pierre, R\u00e9union|Saint-Pierre]]", "location_country": "France", "coordinates": "{{coord|-21.340846|55.490897|type:landmark|display|=|inline,title}}", "opened_date": "{{start date and age|2008}}", "cost": "$1.7 million", "owner": "[[University of Reunion Island]]", "floor_area": "{{convert|739|m2|sqft|abbr|=|on}}"}, "wikidata": {"image (P18)": "Enerpos1ciel.jpg", "located in the administrative territorial entity (P131)": "Saint-Pierre (Q249884)", "instance of (P31)": "building (Q41176)", "coordinate location (P625)": {"latitude": -21.340846, "longitude": 55.490897, "altitude": null, "precision": 0.009644453434223795, "globe": "http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q2"}, "country (P17)": "France (Q142)", "continent (P30)": "Africa (Q15)", "Freebase ID (P646)": "/m/0vpsnps"}, "cat": "Building", "url": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ENERPOS", "wikibase": "Q16256642"}, {"name": "Council House 2 (CH2)", "url_name": "15749468", "txt": "Council House 2 (also known as CH2), is an office building located at 240 Little Collins Street in the CBD of Melbourne, Australia. It is used by the City of Melbourne council, and in April 2005, became the first purpose-built office building in Australia to achieve a maximum Six Green Star rating, certified by the Green Building Council of Australia. CH2 officially opened in August 2006.\n\n\n== Environmental features ==\nComparing to a building with a six Green Star rating, CH2's emissions will be 64% lower. When compared to the existing Council House next door, it is expected to:\n\nreduce electricity consumption by 85%\nreduce gas consumption by 87%\nproduce only 13% of the emissions\nreduce water mains supply by 72%Features include new LCD computer monitors, which will consume 77% less energy, and new T5 light fittings which should consume 65% less energy. The building also houses 48 m2 of solar panels, which provide 60% of hot water, as well as a gas-fired cogeneration plant which provides 40% of the building's overall electricity and heating, with significantly reduced carbon emissions. The cogeneration plant is powered by a Capstone C65 microturbine which produces 65 kW of electricity and 130 kW of hot water.Of the total construction cost of $51 million, $12 million were invested in energy, water and waste innovation. The time for payback is expected to be less than ten years.\n\n\n== Design ==\nCH2 is meant to be a 'lighthouse project' for new building developments, aiming to influence future design to be more sustainable and efficient. Some objectives when designing the building were to be greenhouse neutral and improve the overall employee wellbeing. Different strategies were used when doing this but all were focused around a sustainability aspect.\nBiomimicry was a large component in designing the building. The building's principal design architect, Mick Pearce, incorporated a system previously and successfully used in the Eastgate Centre in Harare. The heating, ventilating, and cooling system (hvac) is designed with strategies taken from a termite mound. In the termite mound, the cool wind is drawn into the base of the mound, via channels and the 'coolth' is stored using wet soil. As the air warms, it flows upwards and out of the mound via vents. This gives the mound the ability to keep a stable temperature. CH2 uses similar strategies with its system by effectively using natural convection, ventilation stacks, thermal mass, phase change material, and water for cooling. Another strategy used taken from nature is the skin system. The fa\u00e7ade is composed of an epidermis (outer skin) and dermis (inner skin). The 'dermis' of the building consists of the outside zone to house the stairs, lifts, ducts, balconies, sunscreens and foliage with the inner line defining the extent of the 'fire compartment'. The dermis was designed with lightweight constructing using a steel frame. The epidermis provides the micro-environment including the primary sun and glare control for the building while creating a semi enclosed micro-environment.\nVentilation stacks are implemented on the north and south fa\u00e7ades of the building. These stacks are used to channel air. The north stacks receive more sun so they are black to absorb heat, which in turn encourages the warm air from the building to rise up out of the stacks. The south stacks are used to channel down cold air through the vents. These stacks also offer shading for office windows.\nThe ceilings are made from pre-cast concrete, with a 'wavy' shape, to optimise surface area, which allows for an increase in thermal mass capacity. The thermal mass in the concrete is flushed at night, through a night purge, absorbing 'coolth' form the night air and allowing it to absorb heat from the space during the day. With the 'wavy' design, heated air is collected at ceiling height, and then channelled out of the building and into the ventilation stacks. Radiant cooling is also a strategy used by running chilled water through beams and ceiling panels. Chilled panels cool the rising warm air, which then drops, creating a natural convection current. Phase change material is used to cool the water for the chilled beams and panels. It efficiently helps to keep the water circulating through the beams and panels at a desired temperature. The phase change material is often referred to as the 'battery' of the building because of its purpose of storing the 'coolth'.\nNatural day lighting was a difficult task for the CH2 team due to the building's orientation and position in relation to surrounding buildings, and the requirement for a deep open plan office space. The best design techniques for CH2 to allow the most natural light included a synergy between windows size and air ducts, light shelves to reflect light into the office area, vaulted ceilings to allow further light penetration, shading on north, west, and east fa\u00e7ades, and finally timber louvres to control light penetration from the afternoon western sun. The light shelves were placed on the north fa\u00e7ade which in turn will create a soft indirect light on the roof space. These light shelves are placed externally and made of fabric in a steel frame. The vaulted ceilings allow for more natural light filtering to the deeper parts of the office space. Locating the windows at the highest point of the curve improved this technique. The east facing fa\u00e7ade uses a perforated metal system for shading that also acts like a thermal chimney. Heat rises pulling air through the eastern part of the building allowing it to be naturally ventilated. The north facing fa\u00e7ade is composed of steel trellises and balconies supporting vertical gardens nine stories high. The foliage protects the building from the sun and also filters sunlight for a reduction of indoor glares. Light shelves are used to provide shading as well as reflect natural light into the building. These light shelves are placed externally and made of fabric in a steel frame. The west facing fa\u00e7ade is covered with a system of timber louvres that pivot to optimise the penetration of natural light and views. These louvres also protect the fa\u00e7ade from the harsh western sun. The louvres open and close depending on the amount of sun that is hitting the western fa\u00e7ade. The louvres are made from untreated recycled timber and are moved by a computer-controlled hydraulic system. The building also uses artificial lighting throughout to provide a sufficient amount of light when natural light is not available. These lights use the low-energy T5 luminaries which achieve a lighting power density of less than 2.5 watts/m2 per 100 lux.\nShower towers are used on the southern fa\u00e7ade. These towers draw outside air from above street level and cool the air by evaporation to form the shower of water. The cool air is then supplied to the retail spaces and the cool water is used to pre-cool the water coming from the chilled water panels. The towers are made from tubes of lightweight fabric 1.4 meters in diameter. Testing from these towers has shown a temperature reduction of 4 to 13 degrees Celsius from the top of the tower to the bottom of the tower.\nThe designers also used an innovative concept of design by using the same amount of foliage on the building as would have been present if the site was still in its original natural vegetated state. This is accomplished by using a roof garden, which also serves as a break-out and recreation space for staff. The northern fa\u00e7ade also incorporates planter boxes situated east and west of each northern balcony.\n\n\n== Indoor environment quality ==\nA main concern when designing CH2 was the indoor environment quality (IEQ), and many steps were made to optimise this in particular. With an improvement in the overall IEQ designers believed this could lead to fewer sick days of occupants, fewer headaches and better well-being while staff are at work. The City of Melbourne's aim was to create a healthy, comfortable, adaptable and stimulating work environment for the staff. Strategies used to improve the IEQ include a well-designed working environment, fresh air, natural light, greenery, and use of materials that emit low amounts of volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Not only do these strategies improve the work place, but also can save the city money based on productivity gains.\nDisplacement ventilation was used as the primary ventilation in CH2. The advantages of using a displacement ventilation system include increased cost effectiveness in operation, improved air quality within occupied zone, greater operational efficiency, ability to conceal, quiet, and finally flexibility. The minimum fresh air requirement at CH2 is 22.5 litres/second/person. This is much higher than the Australian Standard of 10 litres/second/person (AS 1668.2)\nThe higher turnover rate was chosen because research has shown that low fresh air requirements can be directly linked to low productivity and sickness, including colds and flu.Natural light was optimised in the design of CH2 by creating a wavy ceiling, use of light shelves, larger windows at the bottom of building and smaller windows at the top, use of colours to accentuate the natural light, and the concepts that windowed areas were shared by all not owned individuals.\nThe interior of the building is also decorated with a variety of plant life with aesthetic purposes, as well as research that shows that plants reduce the amount of VOCs in the air. In addition to controlling VOCs with plants, CH2 planners chose materials to keep the indoor pollutants at a minimum. Low-VOC paints, low-VOC carpets, low-VOC adhesives and sealants, and low-emission formaldehyde composite wood products are all used in the interiors of the building.\n\n\n== Green Star Rating ==\nGreen Star rates the environmental performance of a building based, in this case, on its design. It is administrated by the Green Building Council of Australia (GBCA). The rating looks at the following aspects of the building process:\n\nBuilding Input\nManagement\nIndoor Environment Quality (IEQ)\nEnergy\nTransport\nWater\nMaterials\nLand Use & Ecology\nEmissions\nInnovationEach of these aspects are then broken up into smaller categories that cover a wide range of topics.\nGreen Star is a public method of demonstrating commitment to environmentally responsible building.  It provides a standard language to discuss sustainability for buildings.\nOn 22 March 2005, CH2 building design was awarded a 6 Star rating under Green Star \u2013 Office Design v1.  The following table presents the points possible, and points awarded for CH2\n\n\n== Post-Occupancy Reports ==\nNote: Post-occupancy reports were recorded after one year of building use while the building was still going under adjustments.\nThermal Comfort: Thermal dissatisfaction ratings should be below 10% in most locations of the building.  The perceived overall thermal comfort is also good but the airflow is perceived to be to low.\nAir Quality:The air quality of CH2 is excellent in terms of measured pollutant levels. The occupants also perceive the air quality to be better.  The formaldehyde concentrations are much lower than compared to common office buildings.  The overall air quality is excellent due to the 100% fresh air intake and the use of low toxicity materials used in all furnishings and finishes as well as an extensive use of indoor plants.\nNoise Levels: Ambient noise levels and reverberation times were considered ideal but the occupant satisfaction ratings for now were average to poor and were generally worse than benchmarks.  This is due to the open floor layout, which improves communication between employees, but allows for unwanted interruptions.  White noise increases satisfaction scores on one level compared to the rest of the building (10\u201318%).\nLighting: The background lighting levels are sufficient, and the recommended task illuminances could be achieved if personal task lighting was switched on.  Occupant satisfaction for lighting is average to poor in CH2 and is worse than some Building Uses Studies benchmarks (BUS).\nPerceived Productivity: Three-quarters of CH2 occupants rate the building as having a positive or neutral effect on productivity, compared to 39% in the original Council House.  CH2 is rated in the top 20% of Australian buildings for perceived productivity.\nPerceived Worker Health: CH2 is rated very highly for perceived healthiness, and is considered to have low levels of occupant reported rates for building related health symptoms.  Absenteeism and staff turnover has not changed but more time must pass to have conclusive data.\nOverall: 80% of occupants prefer CH2 to their previous accommodation.  It was also seen that the staff productivity improved 10.9% resulting in a cost savings of over two million dollars.  The improvement results in a seven-year payback period for the buildings environmental features, three years ahead of the suspected schedule of ten years.\n\n\n== Awards and recognition ==\n2004\n\nExemplar, Imagining the Future Award, Year of the Built Environment Awards, CRC Construction Innovation in association with DesignInc.2005\n\nSpecial Projects Initiative, Award of Excellence LG Pro Local Government Professionals\n6 Start Rating Certification, Green Start Rating Green Building Council of Australia\nGreen Building Award, World Environment Day Awards 2005 United Nations Association2006\n\nGreenhouse Expenditure Award, Eco-Buy Awards 2006\nRecycled Expenditure Award, Eco-Buy Awards 2006\nThe Hey Big Spender Award, Eco-Buy Awards 2006\nEnvironmental Planning or Conservation Award, Awards for Planning Excellence 2006, Planning Institute of Australia, Victoria Division2007\n\nEnvironment Planning or Conservation, National Awards for Planning Excellence, Planning Institute of Australia\nPresident's Award, National Awards for Planning Excellence, Planning Institute of Australia\nSustainable Architecture Award, 2007 Victorian Architecture Awards, Royal Australian Institute of Architects, Victorian Chapter in association with DesignInc.\nPresident's Award, 2007 Excellence in Property Awards, Australian Property Institute, Victorian Division\nSustainable Architecture Award, 2007 National Architecture Awards, Royal Australian Institute of Architects\nFinalist, Sustainable Design, Global Innovator's Awards 2007 CoreNet Global\nEnvironment and Sustainability Award, Victorian Engineering Excellence Awards 2007, Engineers Australia, Victorian Division in association with Lincolne Scott and Bonacci Group\nSustainability Award, IDEA Excellence Awards 2007, (Inside) Australian Design Review in association with DesignInc.\nSire William Hudson Award, Australian Engineering Excellence Awards 2007 Engineers Australia in association with Lincolne Scott and Bonacci Group\nSustainability Building Award (projects under \u00a325,000), Sustainable Building Services Awards UK Chartered Institution of Building Services Engineers (CIBSE) Awarded to Lincolne Scott2010\n\n6 Star \u2013 As Built Rating Certification, Green Star Rating, Green Building Council of Australia\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nSustainable buildings in Australia\nBuilding-integrated renewable energy\nPassive solar building design\nSustainable design\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nCH2 website\nCH2 in Green Star Project Directory, Green Building Council Australia", "infobox": {"name": "Council House 2 (CH<sub>2</sub>)", "image": "CouncilHouse2.jpg", "building_type": "Office", "location": "[[Melbourne, Australia]]", "owner": "[[City of Melbourne]]", "current_tenants": "[[City of Melbourne]]", "start_date": "2004", "completion_date": "2006", "floor_count": "10", "floor_area": "{{convert|12536|m2|sqft|abbr|=|on}}", "main_contractor": "Hansen Yuncken", "architect": "City of Melbourne in association with [[Mick Pearce]] with DesignInc.", "structural_engineer": "Bonacci Group", "services_engineer": "Lincolne Scott", "civil_engineer": "Bonacci Group", "quantity_surveyor": "Donald Cant Watts Corke"}, "wikidata": {"coordinate location (P625)": {"latitude": -37.8142, "longitude": 144.967, "altitude": null, "precision": 0.0001, "globe": "http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q2"}, "country (P17)": "Australia (Q408)", "located in the administrative territorial entity (P131)": "Victoria (Q36687)", "image (P18)": "CouncilHouse2.jpg", "Commons category (P373)": "Council House 2", "instance of (P31)": "green building (Q242606)", "architect (P84)": "Mick Pearce (Q2140435)", "owned by (P127)": "City of Melbourne (Q1919098)", "located on street (P669)": "Little Collins Street (Q14935196)", "date of official opening (P1619)": "+2006-00-00T00:00:00Z", "floors above ground (P1101)": {"amount": "+10", "unit": "1"}, "inception (P571)": "+2006-00-00T00:00:00Z", "Freebase ID (P646)": "/m/03ns6rm"}, "cat": "Building", "url": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Council_House_2", "wikibase": "Q2866891"}, {"name": "Indira Paryavaran Bhawan", "url_name": "42071787", "txt": "Indira Paryavaran Bhawan is India\u2019s first on-site net-zero building located in New Delhi, India. The building houses the Ministry of Environment, Forest  and Climate Change (MoEFCC) accommodating three ministers and their offices along with about 600 officials. The building, designed and constructed by the Central Public Works Department (CPWD), was completed in 2013 at a cost of INR 209 Crore.The inauguration of the building, 28 February 2014, was conducted by the then prime minister Dr. Manmohan Singh. The building is rated as a five-star GRIHA (Green Rating for Integrated Habitat Assessment) by MNRE and LEED India Platinum by Indian Green Building Council (IGBC) rating. The building has its own solar power plant, sewage treatment facility, fully automatic robotic multi-level car parking system facility & puzzle parking facility, and geothermal heat exchange system.\n\n\n== Details ==\nIndira Paryavaran Bhawan consists of two blocks within the premises connected through a corridor. Each block is a G+7 storey structure with 3 basements. The total floor area of the campus is 32,000 sq.metre. Each floor consists of office spaces, meeting rooms, conference rooms etc. The building consists of 7 elevators and a central atrium located in between the two blocks.Indira Paryavaran Bhawan is located in a composite climate zone, a mix of hot, dry, humid, and cold climatic conditions, and the design involves multiple active, passive, and renewable strategies to achieve net zero goal. The building is divided into 5 sections: Vayu (Wind), Agni (Fire), Jal (Water), Prithvi (Earth), and Aakash (Space) depicting the 5 elements that all matters are composed of, as per Hinduism. Indira Paryavaran Bhawan is a set example that impinges on society's consciousness towards environmental awareness for adopting green building concepts in India.The Union environment ministry is facing a challenge of a garden variety - bird droppings, soiling the courtyard of Indira Paryavaran Bhawan, which houses it, and is amongst the India\u2019s highest green-rated buildings. Individuals or organizations which will offer the best solution will be awarded an amount of \u20b91 lakh.\n\n\n== Design ==\n\n\n=== Passive Design Strategies ===\n\n\n==== Orientation ====\nThe orientation of the building is set towards north south direction, to accommodate natural daylight and air movement in the building, a central atrium and corridor provide cross ventilation within the building.\n\n\n==== Landscaping and Horticulture ====\nMore than 50% of the area outside the building is covered with plantations, to conserve as many existing trees as possible, out of a total of 79 trees, only 19 trees are cut and 11 trees are transplanted. The pathways and circulation roads in the building are made with grass paver blocks for ground water percolation and ground water recharge. The 7th floor of building also consists of a terrace garden.\n\n\n==== Daylighting and Ventilation ====\nThe building is designed to ensure daylight in more than 75% of the floor space and to reduce dependency on active lighting devices. The central atrium located between the two blocks allows natural movement of air due to stack effect. The provision of windows further enhances the process of cross ventilation.\n\n\n==== Building Envelope and Fenestration ====\nThe building envelope construction comprises heavy weight construction. The external wall consists of 30 cm thick Autoclave Aerated Concrete (AAC) block, 7 cm thick mineral wool insulation, 12 cm thick air gap and 12 cm thick 'Fal-G' [proprietary blend of fly ash (Fa), lime (L) and gypsum (G)] block brick, and has a U-value of .221 W/m2K. The external roof of the building consists of 2 cm thick clay tile, 6 cm thick cement mortar, 4 cm thick PUF insulation, 6 cm thick brick bat coba, 6 cm thick cement mortar,10 cm thick concrete. High reflectance terrace tiles are installed on the building roof for roof cool treatment - low heat ingress, high strength and hard wearing. Windows installed in the building with uPVC (Unplasticized Polyvinyl Chloride) frame are hermetically sealed double glazed with gas filling with a U-Value of 0.26 W/m2K and SHGC of 0.32 and aluminium frame.\n\n\n==== Material and Construction technique ====\nFly ash bricks and heat-insulating Autoclave Aerated Concrete blocks along with fly ash-based mortar and plaster are used for walls. Low energy materials and locally available stones are utilized for flooring. Bamboo jute composite that is rapidly renewable is used for door frames and shutters. Low VOC paints are used to improvise indoor air quality.\n\n\n=== Active Design Strategies ===\n\n\n==== Lighting Design ====\nEnergy efficient lights are provided in the interior and exterior lighting system of the building. To maximize energy efficiency in lighting, the artificial lighting in the building is regulated using a lux-level sensor. The lighting power density is kept close to 5 W/m2 which is 50% more efficient than the Energy Conservation Building Code 2007 requirement (Lighting Power Density = 11 W/m2). The lighting load is supplied by the building integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) power plant.\n\n\n==== Optimized HVAC System ====\nThe building is centrally air conditioned. Chilled beam system technology is used to meet 160 TR air conditioning load of the building. The process of air conditioning happens by convection currents rather than air supply by ducts. The chilled beams are used from second to sixth floor and this system has reduced energy utilization by up to 50% as compared to the conventional system. Integrated building management is utilized to control HVAC equipment and to monitor related systems. For energy efficiency, the room temperature is maintained at 26 \u00b11 \u00b0C.\n\n\n=== Geothermal Heat Exchange System ===\nTo minimize the load on the HVAC system, a vertical closed loop system of geothermal heat exchange system is implemented. This is the first time it has been adopted on a large scale in a government building in India.  The system takes advantage of the difference between the ambient temperature and the temperature below the ground level.The vertical closed loop system consists of 180 vertical bores all over the premises to a depth of 80 meters. A minimum distance of 3 meters between any two bores is retained. Every bore has a 32mm outer diameter HDPE pipe U-loop and is connected in the central air conditioning plant room to the condenser water pipe system. A single U-Loop with a heat rejection capacity of 0.9TR results in a heat rejection capacity of 160TR from 180 vertical bores, resulting in reduction of cooling tower load and subsequent reduction in water consumption.\n\n\n=== Renewable Energy Systems ===\nA building integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) Power Plant has been installed on the entire roof surface of the building and court area. This clean and green renewable energy system has helped in meeting the energy demand of the building to achieve the target of net-zero energy.\n\n\n=== Robotic Car Parking ===\nAutomated parking system is used on all 3 levels of the basement. The first basement is designed for the lobby and puzzle parking system for car entry and exit. The second and third basement floors use robotic dolly parking systems. The capacity for the first basement is 49, the second basement is 126, and the third basement is 170.\n\n\n=== Water Management ===\nThe landscape and horticulture design of planting native species along with efficient irrigation systems are utilized leading up to 50% reduction in water requirement. The remaining water demand is met by recycling and reusing wastewater, and by implementation of rainwater harvesting systems. Additionally, low discharge and efficient water fixtures are installed including sensor urinals and dual flow cisterns.\n\n\n== Savings ==\n\n\n== Awards ==\nThe building has received the following awards.\n\n\n== References ==", "infobox": {"name": "Indira Paryavaran Bhawan", "awards": "[[LEED]] India Platinum, GRIHA 5 Star", "address": "166, [[Jor Bagh metro station|Jor Bagh Road]], Block 17, [[Lodhi Colony]]<br> [[New Delhi]], [[Delhi]] 110003, [[India]]", "start_date": "{{start date and age|January 25, 2011}}", "completion_date": "{{start date and age|October 31, 2013}}", "inauguration_date": "{{start date and age|February 28, 2014}}", "owner": "[[Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change]]", "cost": "[[Indian rupee|INR]]209 [[Crore|Cr]]", "floor_area": "32,000 sq.m", "floor_count": "G+7 (+3 basements floors)", "parking": "330 Cars", "building_type": "Office", "elevator_count": "7", "architecture_firm": "[[Central Public Works Department]]"}, "wikidata": {"coordinate location (P625)": {"latitude": 28.585, "longitude": 77.218, "altitude": null, "precision": 0.010230119887431, "globe": "http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q2"}, "country (P17)": "India (Q668)", "Microsoft Academic ID (P6366)": "2777605325", "Freebase ID (P646)": "/m/0_t_v06"}, "cat": "Building", "url": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indira_Paryavaran_Bhawan", "wikibase": "Q16892652"}, {"name": "ArthaLand Century Pacific Tower", "url_name": "43369994", "txt": "The ArthaLand Century Pacific Tower is a 32-storey office building in Bonifacio Global City in Taguig, Metro Manila, Philippines.

Since 2012, the government of South Korea has relocated numerous ministries and agencies to Sejong, but many still reside in other cities, primarily Seoul, where the National Assembly and many important government bodies remain.\nSejong has a population of 351,007 as of 2020 and covers a geographic area of 465.23 km2 (179.63 sq mi), making it the least-populous and smallest first-level administrative division in South Korea. Sejong is located in the west-central Hoseo region, bordering South Chungcheong to the west, Daejeon Metropolitan City to the south, and North Chungcheong to the east.\nThe construction of the city should be completed in 2030. In the same year, all government institutions should be moved to Sejong. About 500,000 people are expected to live there in 2030.\n\n\n== Name ==\nSejong was named in honor of King Sejong the Great, the fourth king of the Joseon Dynasty and creator of the Korean alphabet, Hangul. The city was formed by combining Yeongi County, the county of South Chungcheong Province from which the majority of the city's territory was ceded, and other counties.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn 2003, then-President Roh Moo-hyun sought to relocate the national capital of South Korea from the metropolitan city of Seoul to a new multifunctional administrative city in the center of the country. The goal was to reduce the influence and dominance of Seoul on national governance and economics, whilst promoting the regional development of other areas of the country. According to the former Interior Minister Maeng Hyung-gyu in 2012, \"Sejong is a symbol of the country's efforts toward more balanced regional development,\" helping to decongest Seoul and spur investment in the country's central region.\nIn October 2004, the Constitutional Court dealt a setback to President Roh's plans, ruling that the capital must remain in Seoul in response to a complaint filed by the main opposition, the conservative Grand National Party (now Liberty Korea Party). As such, the Roh administration was forced to modify the project to relocate the majority of government ministries and institutions to Sejong, which would become a special administrative city instead of a new capital. The revised plan was approved by the National Assembly in March 2005. Challenges to the new plan were rejected by the Constitutional Court in November 2005.When the Grand National Party retook the presidential office in 2008, then-President Lee Myung-bak opposed the idea of moving government agencies, claiming that it would hurt Seoul's global competitiveness and result in inefficiency. Following Lee's directions, plans were made to make Sejong an industrial, science and education hub instead. This plan was opposed by many, including Roh's allies and some members of the ruling Grand National Party, including Lee's arch-rival and eventual successor, Park Geun-hye. Defeat in the mid-2010 local elections forced Lee to present his proposal to the National Assembly where it was voted down.\nIn July 2012, Sejong Special Self-Governing City was created by combining all of Yeongi County, three townships of Gongju and one township of Cheongwon County.\nIn April 2013, the city government of Putrajaya, Malaysia signed a letter of intent (LOI) with the government of Sejong City to mark cooperation between the two planned capitals.As of 2019, 12 ministries were relocated to the city. As such, only 5 ministries continue to remain in Seoul; the Ministry Of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Unification, Ministry of Justice, Ministry of National Defense, and Ministry of Gender Equality and Family.Sejong was specifically designed to be a \"smart city\", and is sometimes referred to as Sejong smart city. It is the leading smart city in Korea, and is often held up as the standard for other cities experimenting with the development of smart city infrastructure.By 2019, there was disagreement among experts as to whether Sejong had \"lived up to expectations. ...Sejong uses its new development to market itself as an alternative to Seoul, offering luxury living at a fraction of the cost. It boasts shiny state-of-the-art condominiums, ample public green space and smart and sustainable city tech, like automated trash collection and zero-waste food disposal, electric car charging and sharing stations, solar-powered buildings, interactive digital signage, closed-circuit television security and fine dust emergency alerts. [It] has sparked criticism that the new city is not only too lackluster to draw residents away from Seoul, but also difficult to access and poorly designed.\"\n\n\n== Geography ==\nSejong is surrounded by the two provinces of Chungcheongnam-do, and Chungcheongbuk-do, as well as the metropolitan city of Daejeon. It is about 121 kilometres (75 mi) south from Seoul.\n\n\n=== Cityscape ===\nAs of 2012 much of the city was under construction. The residential area, by 2012, had several high-rises built for transferees. At that time the residential area was cordoned off from much of the under-development governmental area and had some restaurants, six schools, and one grocery store.\n\n\n== Administrative divisions ==\n\nThe 10 haengjeong-dong and Jochiwon-eup is the city main urban center. Sejong is divided into 12 haengjeong-dong (administrative neighborhood), 1 eup (town) and 9 myeon (townships).\n\nNotes\nThere are no Hanja for Hansol, Dodam, Areum, Goun, Boram, Serom, Sodam, Dajeong, or Haemil as they are native Korean words.\n\n\n== Population and demographics ==\nThe city aimed to have a population of 200,000 in 2012, 300,000 by 2020 and 500,000 by 2030. As of 2017, Sejong had a population of 281,120.As of 2018, Sejong had a higher proportion of children compared to the South Korean average.As of June 30, 2020, Sejong has a population of 351,007.\n\n\n== Religion ==\n\n\n== Government and infrastructure ==\n\nThe South Korean government plans to move 36 government ministries and agencies to Sejong City.Government Complex Sejong is located in Sejong City. The complex, on a 213,000-square-metre (2,290,000 sq ft) plot of land, has seven stories and one basement. Construction began in November 2011 in what was South Chungcheong Province, and the complex was completed on November 16, 2013. The ceremony to mark the movement of several government agencies to the complex occurred on December 23, 2013.Government Complex Sejong includes the head offices of: \n\nOffice of the Prime Minister (OPM)\nMinistry of Economy and Finance (MOEF)\nMinistry of Education (MOE)\nMinistry of Science and ICT (MSIT)\nMinistry of the Interior and Safety (MOIS)\nMinistry of Culture, Sports and Tourism (MCST)\nMinistry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs (MAFRA)\nMinistry of Trade, Industry and Energy (MOTIE)\nMinistry of Health and Welfare (MOHW)\nMinistry of Environment (ME)\nMinistry of Employment and Labor (MOEL)\nMinistry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport (MOLIT)\nMinistry of Oceans and Fisheries (MOF)\nMinistry of SMEs and Startups (MSS)\nMinistry of Patriots and Veterans Affairs (MPVA)\nMinistry of Personnel Management (MPM)\nMinistry of Government Legislation (MOLEG)\nNational Tax Service (NTS)\nNational Agency for Administrative City Construction (NAACC)\nFair Trade Commission (KFTC)\nAnti-Corruption and Civil Rights Commission (ACRC)Several MOLIT agencies, the Korea Office of Civil Aviation (KOCA), the Korean Maritime Safety Tribunal (KMST), and the Aviation and Railway Accident Investigation Board (ARAIB), have their headquarters in Government Complex Sejong.\n\n\n== Culture ==\nSejong Lake Park was completed in March 2013 and has various theme facilities in the park, including the square fountain.

Korean: \uc138\uc885; Hanja: \u4e16\u5b97), officially the Sejong Special Self-Governing City (\uc138\uc885\ud2b9\ubcc4\uc790\uce58\uc2dc; \u4e16\u5b97\u7279\u5225\u81ea\u6cbb\u5e02), is a special self-governing city and de facto administrative capital of South Korea.\nSejong was founded in 2007 as the new planned capital of South Korea from many parts of the South Chungcheong province and some parts of North Chungcheong province to ease congestion in South Korea's current capital and largest city, Seoul, and encourage investment in the country's central region. Since 2012, the government of South Korea has relocated numerous ministries and agencies to Sejong, but many still reside in other cities, primarily Seoul, where the National Assembly and many important government bodies remain.\nSejong has a population of 351,007 as of 2020 and covers a geographic area of 465.23 km2 (179.63 sq mi), making it the least-populous and smallest first-level administrative division in South Korea. Sejong is located in the west-central Hoseo region, bordering South Chungcheong to the west, Daejeon Metropolitan City to the south, and North Chungcheong to the east.\nThe construction of the city should be completed in 2030. In the same year, all government institutions should be moved to Sejong. About 500,000 people are expected to live there in 2030.\n\n\n== Name ==\nSejong was named in honor of King Sejong the Great, the fourth king of the Joseon Dynasty and creator of the Korean alphabet, Hangul. The city was formed by combining Yeongi County, the county of South Chungcheong Province from which the majority of the city's territory was ceded, and other counties.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn 2003, then-President Roh Moo-hyun sought to relocate the national capital of South Korea from the metropolitan city of Seoul to a new multifunctional administrative city in the center of the country. The goal was to reduce the influence and dominance of Seoul on national governance and economics, whilst promoting the regional development of other areas of the country. According to the former Interior Minister Maeng Hyung-gyu in 2012, \"Sejong is a symbol of the country's efforts toward more balanced regional development,\" helping to decongest Seoul and spur investment in the country's central region.\nIn October 2004, the Constitutional Court dealt a setback to President Roh's plans, ruling that the capital must remain in Seoul in response to a complaint filed by the main opposition, the conservative Grand National Party (now Liberty Korea Party). As such, the Roh administration was forced to modify the project to relocate the majority of government ministries and institutions to Sejong, which would become a special administrative city instead of a new capital. The revised plan was approved by the National Assembly in March 2005. Challenges to the new plan were rejected by the Constitutional Court in November 2005.When the Grand National Party retook the presidential office in 2008, then-President Lee Myung-bak opposed the idea of moving government agencies, claiming that it would hurt Seoul's global competitiveness and result in inefficiency. Following Lee's directions, plans were made to make Sejong an industrial, science and education hub instead. This plan was opposed by many, including Roh's allies and some members of the ruling Grand National Party, including Lee's arch-rival and eventual successor, Park Geun-hye. Defeat in the mid-2010 local elections forced Lee to present his proposal to the National Assembly where it was voted down.\nIn July 2012, Sejong Special Self-Governing City was created by combining all of Yeongi County, three townships of Gongju and one township of Cheongwon County.\nIn April 2013, the city government of Putrajaya, Malaysia signed a letter of intent (LOI) with the government of Sejong City to mark cooperation between the two planned capitals.As of 2019, 12 ministries were relocated to the city. As such, only 5 ministries continue to remain in Seoul; the Ministry Of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Unification, Ministry of Justice, Ministry of National Defense, and Ministry of Gender Equality and Family.Sejong was specifically designed to be a \"smart city\", and is sometimes referred to as Sejong smart city. It is the leading smart city in Korea, and is often held up as the standard for other cities experimenting with the development of smart city infrastructure.By 2019, there was disagreement among experts as to whether Sejong had \"lived up to expectations. ...Sejong uses its new development to market itself as an alternative to Seoul, offering luxury living at a fraction of the cost. It boasts shiny state-of-the-art condominiums, ample public green space and smart and sustainable city tech, like automated trash collection and zero-waste food disposal, electric car charging and sharing stations, solar-powered buildings, interactive digital signage, closed-circuit television security and fine dust emergency alerts. [It] has sparked criticism that the new city is not only too lackluster to draw residents away from Seoul, but also difficult to access and poorly designed.\"\n\n\n== Geography ==\nSejong is surrounded by the two provinces of Chungcheongnam-do, and Chungcheongbuk-do, as well as the metropolitan city of Daejeon. It is about 121 kilometres (75 mi) south from Seoul.\n\n\n=== Cityscape ===\nAs of 2012 much of the city was under construction. The residential area, by 2012, had several high-rises built for transferees. At that time the residential area was cordoned off from much of the under-development governmental area and had some restaurants, six schools, and one grocery store.\n\n\n== Administrative divisions ==\n\nThe 10 haengjeong-dong and Jochiwon-eup is the city main urban center. Sejong is divided into 12 haengjeong-dong (administrative neighborhood), 1 eup (town) and 9 myeon (townships).\n\nNotes\nThere are no Hanja for Hansol, Dodam, Areum, Goun, Boram, Serom, Sodam, Dajeong, or Haemil as they are native Korean words.\n\n\n== Population and demographics ==\nThe city aimed to have a population of 200,000 in 2012, 300,000 by 2020 and 500,000 by 2030. As of 2017, Sejong had a population of 281,120.As of 2018, Sejong had a higher proportion of children compared to the South Korean average.As of June 30, 2020, Sejong has a population of 351,007.\n\n\n== Religion ==\n\n\n== Government and infrastructure ==\n\nThe South Korean government plans to move 36 government ministries and agencies to Sejong City.Government Complex Sejong is located in Sejong City.

Construction began in November 2011 in what was South Chungcheong Province, and the complex was completed on November 16, 2013.

The fortifications of the thirteenth century are the best preserved in Brittany.\n\n\n== Situation ==\nThe ramparts follow the contours of the rocky plateau where the Ch\u00e2teau de Vitr\u00e9 and the urban nucleus developing around the Church of Notre-Dame \u00c9glise_Notre-Dame_de_Vitr\u00e9 are built.

To the north flows the river Vilaine where there was a pond, swamps and a very high talus of 30 meters. The views over the landscape were excellent. In the south, the depression created by Vernouzet Vernouzet stream was an additional protection. The defensive fragility was to the east, direction from Laval and the French Kingdom, because access was so easy.\nVitr\u00e9 is located in the Armorican Massif, at the interface of zones of beige sandstone, and schists (argillites, black micaceous siltites, locally with ferruginous oolites). The ramparts are built with these materials available on the place. As a consequence, the exploitation of the stone has allowed the creation of large ditches to the south and east of the intramuros city of the order of 12 m (39 ft.) depth and a width of 20 m (66 ft.). A small supermarket in the rue de la Borderie has two levels of basement up to the level of the old ditches and illustrates these dimensions.\nThe inventory of the Baronnie de Vitr\u00e9 in 1681 testifies to the presence of springs and fountains in the moat, exploited by the inhabitants of the faubourgs for laundry, orchards and gardens.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe ramparts were built in 1240 by Baron Andrew III and reinforced with the development of artillery in the 15th century.\nVitr\u00e9 was a Protestant city, rich and prosperous. But during the religious wars, attacks by the Catholic leagues destroyed a part of the towers and ramparts east of the ancient city. At the end of the 16th century, a bastion was built in 1591.\nThe fortifications were destroyed in the south in the 19th century to connect the old town with the modern neighborhood. The Gare de Vitr\u00e9 arrived in 1857.\nIn 1987, the Tour des Claviers was discovered during the construction of a residential building. The old town is classified as a \"remarkable heritage site\" and the town borough engages in the renovation of this ramparts (Tour de la Bridole). All fortifications have been classified \"historical monuments\" on January 15, 2014.The remains of walls and towers are the most outstanding to the north and east of the intramuros of Vitr\u00e9, along the Promenade du Val with exceptional point of view.\n\n\n== Plan of fortifications ==\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==\n\nDaniel Pichot, Val\u00e9rie Lagier et Gwenol\u00e9 Allain, Vitr\u00e9 : Histoire et Patrimoine d'une Ville, Vitr\u00e9, Somogy, \u00c9ditions d'Art, avril 2009, 295 p.

It has no historical relation to the modern republic of Benin, which was historically known as Dahomey from the 17th century until 1975. The Kingdom of Benin's capital was Edo, now known as Benin City in Edo state, Nigeria. The Benin Kingdom was \"one of the oldest and most developed states in the coastal hinterland of West Africa\". It was formed out of the previous Edo Kingdom of Igodomigodo around the 11th century AD, and lasted until it was annexed by the British Empire in 1897.\n\n\n== Oral traditions ==\nThe original people and founders of the Benin Kingdom, the Edo people, were initially ruled by the Ogiso (Kings of the Sky) who called their land Igodomigodo. The first Ogiso (Ogiso Igodo), wielded much influence and gained popularity as a good ruler. He died after a long reign and was succeeded by Ere, his eldest son. In the 12th century, a great palace intrigue erupted and crown prince Ekaladerhan, the only son of the last Ogiso, was sentenced to death as a result of the first queen (who was barren) deliberately changing an oracle's message to the Ogiso. In carrying out the royal order that he be killed, the palace messengers had mercy and set the prince free at Ughoton near Benin. When his father the Ogiso died, the Ogiso dynasty officially ended. The people and royal kingmakers preferred their late king's son as the next to rule.\n\nThe exiled Prince Ekaladerhan had by this time changed his name to Izoduwa (meaning 'I have chosen the path of prosperity') and found his way to Ile-Ife. It was during this period of confusion in Benin that the elders, led by Chief Oliha, mounted a search for the banished Prince Ekaladerhan \u2013 whom the Ile-Ife people now called Oduduwa. Oduduwa, who could not return due to his advanced age, granted them Oranmiyan, his grandson, to rule over them. Oranmiyan was resisted by Ogiamien Irebor, one of the palace chiefs, and took up his abode in the palace built for him at Usama by the elders (now a coronation shrine). Soon after his arrival, he married a beautiful lady, Erinmwinde, daughter of Ogie-Egor, the ninth Enogie of Egor, by whom he had a son. After residing there for some years he called a meeting of the people and renounced his office, remarking in vexation Ile-Ibinu (\"ile\" means land, \"binu\" mean anger, and thus the kingdom was called Ibinu, which was mispronounced Bini in the 15th and 16th centuries by the Portuguese). This was out of frustration as he often expressed that \"only a child born, trained and educated in the arts and mysteries of the land could reign over the people\". He arranged for his son born to him by Erinmwinde, Eweka, to be made king in his place, and returned to Yorubaland thereafter. His son the new king was soon found to be deaf and mute, and so the elders appealed to Oranmiyan. He gave them charmed seeds known as \"omo ayo\" to play with, saying that to do so will make him talk. The little Eweka played with the seeds with his peers at Useh near egor, his mother's hometown. While playing with the seeds, he announced \"Owomika\" as his royal name. Thus, he gave rise to the tradition of the subsequent Obas of Benin spending seven days and nights at Usama before proceeding to announce their royal names at Useh. Eweka thus started a dynasty that now bears his name. Oranmiyan went on to serve as the founder of the Oyo Empire, where he ruled as the first Alaafin of Oyo. His descendants now rule in Ile Ife, Oyo and Benin.By the 15th century, Benin had expanded into a thriving city-state. The twelfth Oba in the line, Oba Ewuare the Great (1440\u20131473) would expand the city-state's territories to surrounding regions.It was not until the 15th century, during the reign of Oba Ewuare the Great, that the kingdom's administrative centre, the city of Ubinu (or Ibinu), began to be known as Benin City by the Portuguese, a pronunciation later adopted by the locals as well. The Portuguese would write this down as Benin City. Edo's neighbours, such as the Itsekiris and the Urhobos, continued to refer to the city as Ubini up until the late 19th century.Aside from Benin City, the system of rule of the Oba in the empire, even through the golden age of the kingdom, was still loosely based upon the Ogiso dynasty's tradition, which was military protection in exchange for pledged allegiance and taxes paid to the royal administrative centre. The language and culture was not enforced, as the empire remained heterogeneous and localized according to each group within the kingdom, though a local enogie (or duke) was often appointed by the Oba for specific ethnic areas.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\nBy the 1st century BC, the Benin territory was partially agricultural; and it became primarily agricultural by around 500 AD, but hunting and gathering still remained important. Also by 500 AD, iron was in use by the inhabitants of the Benin territory.Benin City (formerly Edo) sprang up by around 1000, in a forest that could be easily defended. The dense vegetation and narrow paths made the city easy to defend against attacks. The rainforest, which Benin City is situated in, helped in the development of the city because of its vast resources \u2013 fish from rivers and creeks, animals to hunt, leaves for roofing, plants for medicine, ivory for carving and trading, and wood for boat building \u2013 that could be exploited. However, domesticated animals, from the forest and surrounding areas, could not survive, due to a disease spread by tsetse flies; after centuries of exposure, some animals, such as cattle and goats, developed a resistance to the disease.The original name of the kingdom of Benin, at its creation some time in the first millennium CE, was Igodomigodo, as its inhabitants called it. Their ruler was called Ogiso \u2013 the ruler of the sky. Nearly 36 known Ogiso are accounted for as rulers of this initial incarnation of the state.\n\n\n=== Architecture ===\n\nThe Walls of Benin are a series of earthworks made up of banks and ditches, called Iya in the Edo language in the area around present-day Benin City, the capital of present-day Edo, Nigeria. They consist of 15 kilometres (9.3 miles) of city iya and an estimated 16,000 kilometres (9,900 miles)  in the rural area around Benin. Some estimates suggest that the walls of Benin may have been constructed between the thirteenth and mid-fifteenth century CE and others suggest that the walls of Benin (in the Esan region) may have been constructed during the first millennium AD.\n\n\n=== History ===\n\n\n==== First Encounters and Records ====\nThe Benin City walls have been known to Westerners since around 1500. Around 1500, the Portuguese explorer Duarte Pacheco Pereira, briefly described the walls during his travels. Another description given around 1600, one hundred years after Pereira's description, is by the Dutch explorer Dierick Ruiters.Pereira's account of the walls is as follows:\n\nThis city is about a league long from gate to gate; it has no wall but is surrounded by a large moat, very wide and deep, which suffices for its defence.\nThe archaeologist Graham Connah suggests that Pereira was mistaken with his description by saying that there was no wall. Connah says, \"[Pereira] considered that a bank of earth was not a wall in the sense of the Europe of his day.\"Ruiters' account of the walls is as follows:\n\nAt the gate where I entered on horseback, I saw a very high bulwark, very thick of earth, with a very deep broad ditch, but it was dry, and full of high trees... That gate is a reasonable good gate, made of wood in their manner, which is to be shut, and there always there is watch holden.\n\n\n==== Construction ====\nEstimates for the initial construction of the walls range from the first millennium to the mid-fifteenth century.  According to Connah, oral tradition and travelers' accounts suggest a construction date of 1450\u20131500. It has been estimated that, assuming a ten-hour work day, a labour force of 5,000 men could have completed the walls within 97 days, or by 2,421 men in 200 days. However, these estimates have been criticized for not taking into account the time it would have taken to extract earth from an ever deepening hole and the time it would have taken to heap the earth into a high bank. It is unknown whether slavery or some other type of labour was used in the construction of the walls.\n\n\n==== Description ====\n\nThe walls were built of a ditch and dike structure; the ditch dug to form an inner moat with the excavated earth used to form the exterior rampart.\nThe Benin Walls were partially demolished by the British in 1897 during their 1897 punitive expedition. Scattered pieces of the structure remain in Edo, with the vast majority of them being used by the locals for building purposes. What remains of the wall itself continues to be torn down for real estate developments in Nigeria.Fred Pearce wrote in New Scientist:", "infobox": {"native_name": "''Edo''", "conventional_long_name": "Kingdom of Benin", "common_name": "Benin Kingdom", "government_type": "[[Monarchy]]", "year_start": "1180", "year_end": "1897", "event_end": "Annexed by the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]]", "p1": "Igodomigodo", "flag_p1": "Transparent_flag_with_question_mark.png", "s1": "Southern Nigeria Protectorate", "flag_s1": "Flag of the Southern Nigeria Protectorate (1900\u20131914).svg", "image_map": "Benin 1625 locator.png", "image_map_caption": "The extent of Benin in 1625", "capital": "Edo<br/>(now [[Benin City]])", "common_languages": "[[Edo language|Edo]]", "leader1": "Eweka I", "leader2": "[[Ewuare]] (1440\u20131473)", "leader3": "[[Ovonramwen]] (exile 1897)", "leader4": "[[Erediauwa I]] (post-imperial)", "leader5": "[[Ewuare II]] (post-imperial)", "year_leader1": "1180\u20131246", "year_leader2": "1440\u20131473", "year_leader4": "1978\u20132016", "year_leader5": "2016\u2013", "title_leader": "[[Oba of Benin#List of Obas of the Benin Empire|King (Oba)]]", "today": "[[Nigeria]]"}, "wikidata": {"Commons category (P373)": "Benin Empire", "Freebase ID (P646)": "/m/02wqgm", "inception (P571)": "+1170-01-01T00:00:00Z", "dissolved, abolished or demolished date (P576)": "+1897-01-01T00:00:00Z", "instance of (P31)": ["historical country (Q3024240)", "traditional state in Nigeria (Q18920569)", "realm (Q1250464)", "polity (Q1063239)"], "coordinate location (P625)": {"latitude": 6.31667, "longitude": 5.6, "altitude": null, "precision": 9.0380227988515, "globe": "http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q2"}, "notable work (P800)": "Benin Bronzes (Q248101)", "Encyclop\u00e6dia Universalis ID (P3219)": "royaume-du-benin", "ASC Leiden Thesaurus ID (P5198)": "294901272", "country (P17)": "Nigeria (Q1033)", "continent (P30)": "Africa (Q15)", "image (P18)": ["Benin kingdom Louvre A97-4-1.jpg", "Benin bronze Louvre A97-14-1.jpg"], "Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Online ID (P1417)": "place/Benin-historical-kingdom-West-Africa", "Great Russian Encyclopedia Online ID (P2924)": "1875342", "BlackPast.org ID (P6723)": "global-african-history/benin", "Gran Enciclop\u00e8dia Catalana ID (P1296)": "0009253", "NKCR AUT ID (P691)": "ge484444", "described by source (P1343)": "The Nuttall Encyclop\u00e6dia (Q3181656)", "Treccani's Dizionario di Storia ID (P6404)": "regno-del-benin", "flag image (P41)": "Unidentified West African flag.svg", "language used (P2936)": "Yoruba (Q34311)", "locator map image (P242)": "Benin 1625 locator.png", "Larousse ID (P6058)": "autre-region/wd/98869", "capital (P36)": "Benin City (Q320704)", "Grove Art Online ID (P8406)": "T007886", "iDAI.gazetteer ID (P8217)": "2379015", "GND ID (P227)": "4069261-9", "Getty Thesaurus of Geographic Names ID (P1667)": "8711681", "museum-digital place ID (P9957)": "5375", "World History Encyclopedia ID (P9000)": "Kingdom_of_Benin"}, "cat": "City", "url": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Benin", "wikibase": "Q171203"}, {"name": "Benin Kingdom", "url_name": "25649488", "txt": "The Kingdom of Benin (also known as the Edo Kingdom, or the Benin Empire) was a kingdom in what is now in southwestern  Nigeria.

What remains of the wall itself continues to be torn down for real estate developments in Nigeria.Fred Pearce wrote in New Scientist:", "infobox": {"native_name": "''Edo''", "conventional_long_name": "Kingdom of Benin", "common_name": "Benin Kingdom", "government_type": "[[Monarchy]]", "year_start": "1180", "year_end": "1897", "event_end": "Annexed by the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]]", "p1": "Igodomigodo", "flag_p1": "Transparent_flag_with_question_mark.png", "s1": "Southern Nigeria Protectorate", "flag_s1": "Flag of the Southern Nigeria Protectorate (1900\u20131914).svg", "image_map": "Benin 1625 locator.png", "image_map_caption": "The extent of Benin in 1625", "capital": "Edo<br/>(now [[Benin City]])", "common_languages": "[[Edo language|Edo]]", "leader1": "Eweka I", "leader2": "[[Ewuare]] (1440\u20131473)", "leader3": "[[Ovonramwen]] (exile 1897)", "leader4": "[[Erediauwa I]] (post-imperial)", "leader5": "[[Ewuare II]] (post-imperial)", "year_leader1": "1180\u20131246", "year_leader2": "1440\u20131473", "year_leader4": "1978\u20132016", "year_leader5": "2016\u2013", "title_leader": "[[Oba of Benin#List of Obas of the Benin Empire|King (Oba)]]", "today": "[[Nigeria]]"}, "wikidata": {"Commons category (P373)": "Benin Empire", "Freebase ID (P646)": "/m/02wqgm", "inception (P571)": "+1170-01-01T00:00:00Z", "dissolved, abolished or demolished date (P576)": "+1897-01-01T00:00:00Z", "instance of (P31)": ["historical country (Q3024240)", "traditional state in Nigeria (Q18920569)", "realm (Q1250464)", "polity (Q1063239)"], "coordinate location (P625)": {"latitude": 6.31667, "longitude": 5.6, "altitude": null, "precision": 9.0380227988515, "globe": "http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q2"}, "notable work (P800)": "Benin Bronzes (Q248101)", "Encyclop\u00e6dia Universalis ID (P3219)": "royaume-du-benin", "ASC Leiden Thesaurus ID (P5198)": "294901272", "country (P17)": "Nigeria (Q1033)", "continent (P30)": "Africa (Q15)", "image (P18)": ["Benin kingdom Louvre A97-4-1.jpg", "Benin bronze Louvre A97-14-1.jpg"], "Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Online ID (P1417)": "place/Benin-historical-kingdom-West-Africa", "Great Russian Encyclopedia Online ID (P2924)": "1875342", "BlackPast.org ID (P6723)": "global-african-history/benin", "Gran Enciclop\u00e8dia Catalana ID (P1296)": "0009253", "NKCR AUT ID (P691)": "ge484444", "described by source (P1343)": "The Nuttall Encyclop\u00e6dia (Q3181656)", "Treccani's Dizionario di Storia ID (P6404)": "regno-del-benin", "flag image (P41)": "Unidentified West African flag.svg", "language used (P2936)": "Yoruba (Q34311)", "locator map image (P242)": "Benin 1625 locator.png", "Larousse ID (P6058)": "autre-region/wd/98869", "capital (P36)": "Benin City (Q320704)", "Grove Art Online ID (P8406)": "T007886", "iDAI.gazetteer ID (P8217)": "2379015", "GND ID (P227)": "4069261-9", "Getty Thesaurus of Geographic Names ID (P1667)": "8711681", "museum-digital place ID (P9957)": "5375", "World History Encyclopedia ID (P9000)": "Kingdom_of_Benin"}, "cat": "City", "url": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Benin", "wikibase": "Q171203"}, {"name": "\u0e40\u0e17\u0e28\u0e1a\u0e32\u0e25\u0e19\u0e04\u0e23\u0e02\u0e2d\u0e19\u0e41\u0e01\u0e48\u0e19", "url_name": "203855", "txt": "Khon Kaen (Thai: \u0e02\u0e2d\u0e19\u0e41\u0e01\u0e48\u0e19, pronounced [k\u02b0\u0254\u030c(\u02d0)n k\u025b\u0300n]) is one of the four major cities of Isan, Thailand, also known as the \"big four of Isan\", the others being Udon Thani, Nakhon Ratchasima, and Ubon Ratchathani. It is the capital of Khon Kaen Province and the Mueang Khon Kaen District. Khon Kaen lies 450 kilometres (280 mi) north-northeast of Bangkok.\n\n\n== Geography and demography ==\nKhon Kaen is on the Khorat Plateau, elevation 187 m, and is the center of the mid-northeastern provincial group of Thailand, according to the Thai government. Its coordinates are 16\u00b026\u2032N 102\u00b050\u2032E. The city has a population of 114,459.\n\n\n== Regional importance ==\nKhon Kaen is a city in the northeastern region of Thailand. The city is bisected by Mithraphap Road, also known as the \"Friendship Highway\", or \"Highway 2\", the road linking Bangkok to the Thai-Lao Friendship Bridge. Highway 230, a modern, multi-lane by-pass enables through-traffic to avoid the city center to the west, and connects to the airport, the new main bus station (BKS3), and to the highway 12 to Kalasin and Maha Sarakham in the east, and Udon Thani in the north.The city can be easily navigated by driving along with either of the two north-south main roads: Na Muang and Klang Muang, which are east and parallel to the Friendship Highway. In addition, there are two main east-west roads: Srichan Road and Prachasamosorn Road, leading east to the city of Kalasin, and west to the airport, as well as to other small villages via highway 12.\n\n\n== Smart City initiative ==\nThe province of Khon Kaen's 2017 population was 1.8 million with a GDP of 190 billion baht. Its Smart City development plan aims to double its GDP per person to 394,000-493,000 baht by 2029 from an average of about 192,000 baht in 2016. Khon Kaen's plan has been incorporated into Thailand's 12th national social and economic plan (2017-2021). The plan has been driven largely by the Khon Kaen Think Tank (KKTT), a group of involved citizens. The Smart City's signature project is the Khon Kaen Transit System Co (KKTS), founded in 2017. Its plans for a 26 km light rail network from Samran to Tha Phra in the Mueang Khon Kaen District are complete and awaiting Thai Cabinet approval before bidding on the project can begin. The light rail system will feature 18 to 21 stations, take two years to complete, and will cost 15 billion baht. The Land Traffic Management Commission (LTMC), a national think tank for transportation policy, has already blessed the plan.\n\n\n== Climate ==\nKhon Kaen's climate is categorised as tropical savanna (K\u00f6ppen climate classification Aw), with winters that are dry and very warm. Temperatures rise until April\u2014a very hot month, with an average daily maximum of 36.4 \u00b0C (97.5 \u00b0F). The monsoon season runs from May until October, with heavy rain and somewhat cooler temperatures during the day, although nights remain warm.\n\n\n== Culture ==\nThailand's 2014 EU Film Festival included Khon Kaen, together with Chiang Mai and Bangkok, as host locations. A selection of six films was shown in the city, including the Spanish film The Pelayos and the Polish film Walesa, Man of Hope.\n\n\n== Administration ==\nOn 20 August 1935 Khon Kaen town municipality (thesaban mueang) was established, with an area of 4.031 sq.km. On 24 September 1995 Khon Kaen was upgraded to city municipality (thesaban nakhon). The administration of the city is responsible for an area that covers approximately 46 sq.km. and consists of 66,179 households. There are 95 communities (chumchon) divided as follows: zone 1 - 17, zone 2 - 28, zone 3 - 31 and zone 4 - 19 communities.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Khon Kaen travel guide from Wikivoyage\nTourism Thailand official website", "infobox": {"name": "Khon Kaen", "official_name": "City of Khon Kaen<br />\u0e40\u0e17\u0e28\u0e1a\u0e32\u0e25\u0e19\u0e04\u0e23\u0e02\u0e2d\u0e19\u0e41\u0e01\u0e48\u0e19", "native_name": "{{lang|th|\u0e02\u0e2d\u0e19\u0e41\u0e01\u0e48\u0e19}}", "settlement_type": "[[List of municipalities in Thailand|City Municipality]]", "image_skyline": "Monument of King Rama IV at Khon Kaen University.JPG", "image_caption": "[[Rama IV]] monument, [[Khon Kaen University]]", "image_flag": "Khon Kaen Flag.png", "flag_size": "100px", "image_seal": "Seal Khon Kaen.png", "seal_size": "100px", "pushpin_map": "Thailand", "pushpin_label_position": "left", "pushpin_map_caption": "Location in [[Thailand]]", "pushpin_mapsize": "220", "subdivision_type": "[[List of sovereign states|Country]]", "subdivision_name": "Thailand", "subdivision_type1": "[[Provinces of Thailand|Province]]", "subdivision_name1": "[[Khon Kaen Province|Khon Kaen]]", "subdivision_type2": "[[Amphoe|District]]", "subdivision_name2": "[[Mueang Khon Kaen District|Muang Khon Kaen]]", "government_type": "City Municipality", "leader_title": "Mayor", "leader_name": "Thirasak Thikhayuphan<br>(since Sept 2012)", "established_title": "Town municipality", "established_date": "20 Aug 1935", "established_title1": "City municipality", "established_date1": "24 Sept 1995", "unit_pref": "Metric", "area_rank": "10th", "area_total_km2": "46", "elevation_m": "187", "population_as_of": "2019", "population_note": "Registered residents", "population_rank": "11th", "population_total": "114,459", "population_density_km2": "2,488", "timezone": "[[UTC+07:00|ICT]]", "utc_offset": "+7", "coordinates": "{{coord|16|26|N|102|50|E|region:TH|display|=|inline,title}}", "postal_code_type": "[[Postal codes in Thailand|Postcode]]", "postal_code": "40000", "area_code_type": "[[Telephone numbers in Thailand|Calling ode]]", "area_code": "043", "website": "{{URL|www.kkmuni.go.th}}"}, "wikidata": {"Commons category (P373)": "Khon Kaen", "country (P17)": "Thailand (Q869)", "coordinate location (P625)": [{"latitude": 16.433333333333, "longitude": 102.83333333333, "altitude": null, "precision": 0.016666666666667, "globe": "http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q2"}, {"latitude": 16.4297, "longitude": 102.8297, "altitude": null, "precision": 0.000277778, "globe": "http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q2"}], "topic's main category (P910)": "Category:Khon Kaen (Q8573308)", "Freebase ID (P646)": "/m/01cygw", "instance of (P31)": ["Thesaban Nakhon (Q15141632)", "big city (Q1549591)"], "located in the administrative territorial entity (P131)": "Mueang Khon Kaen (Q476023)", "Thailand central administrative unit code (P1067)": "4099", "GeoNames ID (P1566)": "1609776", "GND ID (P227)": "4240920-2", "native label (P1705)": "\u0e40\u0e17\u0e28\u0e1a\u0e32\u0e25\u0e19\u0e04\u0e23\u0e02\u0e2d\u0e19\u0e41\u0e01\u0e48\u0e19", "VIAF ID (P214)": "134993539", "population (P1082)": [{"amount": "+115928", "unit": "1"}, {"amount": "+113754", "unit": "1"}, {"amount": "+120957", "unit": "1"}], "page banner (P948)": "Khon Kaen Banner.jpg", "image (P18)": "Hotel in Khon Kaen.jpg", "IPA transcription (P898)": "k\u02b0\u0254\u030c(\u02d0)n k\u025b\u0300n", "WOEID (P1281)": "1226003", "official website (P856)": "http://www.kkmuni.go.th/", "official name (P1448)": "\u0e40\u0e17\u0e28\u0e1a\u0e32\u0e25\u0e19\u0e04\u0e23\u0e02\u0e2d\u0e19\u0e41\u0e01\u0e48\u0e19", "Quora topic ID (P3417)": "Khon-Kaen-Thailand", "area (P2046)": {"amount": "+46.00", "unit": "http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q712226"}, "Great Russian Encyclopedia Online ID (P2924)": "2126398", "seal image (P158)": "Seal of Khon Kaen.png", "postal code (P281)": "40000", "located in time zone (P421)": "UTC+07:00 (Q6940)", "elevation above sea level (P2044)": {"amount": "+162", "unit": "http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q11573"}, "capital of (P1376)": "Khon Kaen (Q327533)", "Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Online ID (P1417)": "place/Khon-Kaen", "Gran Enciclop\u00e8dia Catalana ID (P1296)": "0514852", "Who's on First ID (P6766)": "102025307", "WorldCat Identities ID (P7859)": "lccn-n89284983", "NKCR AUT ID (P691)": "ge307115", "coextensive with (P3403)": "Nai Mueang (Q16138088)", "Store norske leksikon ID (P4342)": "Khon_Kaen", "National Library of Israel J9U ID (P8189)": "987007562765905171", "Den Store Danske ID (P8313)": "Khon_Kaen"}, "cat": "City", "url": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khon_Kaen", "wikibase": "Q876526"}, {"name": "Khon Kaen", "url_name": "203855", "txt": "Khon Kaen (Thai: \u0e02\u0e2d\u0e19\u0e41\u0e01\u0e48\u0e19, pronounced [k\u02b0\u0254\u030c(\u02d0)n k\u025b\u0300n]) is one of the four major cities of Isan, Thailand, also known as the \"big four of Isan\", the others being Udon Thani, Nakhon Ratchasima, and Ubon Ratchathani.

as the \"big four of Isan\", the others being Udon Thani, Nakhon Ratchasima, and Ubon Ratchathani. It is the capital of Khon Kaen Province and the Mueang Khon Kaen District. Khon Kaen lies 450 kilometres (280 mi) north-northeast of Bangkok.\n\n\n== Geography and demography ==\nKhon Kaen is on the Khorat Plateau, elevation 187 m, and is the center of the mid-northeastern provincial group of Thailand, according to the Thai government. Its coordinates are 16\u00b026\u2032N 102\u00b050\u2032E. The city has a population of 114,459.\n\n\n== Regional importance ==\nKhon Kaen is a city in the northeastern region of Thailand. The city is bisected by Mithraphap Road, also known as the \"Friendship Highway\", or \"Highway 2\", the road linking Bangkok to the Thai-Lao Friendship Bridge. Highway 230, a modern, multi-lane by-pass enables through-traffic to avoid the city center to the west, and connects to the airport, the new main bus station (BKS3), and to the highway 12 to Kalasin and Maha Sarakham in the east, and Udon Thani in the north.The city can be easily navigated by driving along with either of the two north-south main roads: Na Muang and Klang Muang, which are east and parallel to the Friendship Highway. In addition, there are two main east-west roads: Srichan Road and Prachasamosorn Road, leading east to the city of Kalasin, and west to the airport, as well as to other small villages via highway 12.\n\n\n== Smart City initiative ==\nThe province of Khon Kaen's 2017 population was 1.8 million with a GDP of 190 billion baht. Its Smart City development plan aims to double its GDP per person to 394,000-493,000 baht by 2029 from an average of about 192,000 baht in 2016. Khon Kaen's plan has been incorporated into Thailand's 12th national social and economic plan (2017-2021). The plan has been driven largely by the Khon Kaen Think Tank (KKTT), a group of involved citizens. The Smart City's signature project is the Khon Kaen Transit System Co (KKTS), founded in 2017. Its plans for a 26 km light rail network from Samran to Tha Phra in the Mueang Khon Kaen District are complete and awaiting Thai Cabinet approval before bidding on the project can begin. The light rail system will feature 18 to 21 stations, take two years to complete, and will cost 15 billion baht. The Land Traffic Management Commission (LTMC), a national think tank for transportation policy, has already blessed the plan.\n\n\n== Climate ==\nKhon Kaen's climate is categorised as tropical savanna (K\u00f6ppen climate classification Aw), with winters that are dry and very warm. Temperatures rise until April\u2014a very hot month, with an average daily maximum of 36.4 \u00b0C (97.5 \u00b0F). The monsoon season runs from May until October, with heavy rain and somewhat cooler temperatures during the day, although nights remain warm.\n\n\n== Culture ==\nThailand's 2014 EU Film Festival included Khon Kaen, together with Chiang Mai and Bangkok, as host locations. A selection of six films was shown in the city, including the Spanish film The Pelayos and the Polish film Walesa, Man of Hope.\n\n\n== Administration ==\nOn 20 August 1935 Khon Kaen town municipality (thesaban mueang) was established, with an area of 4.031 sq.km. On 24 September 1995 Khon Kaen was upgraded to city municipality (thesaban nakhon). The administration of the city is responsible for an area that covers approximately 46 sq.km. and consists of 66,179 households. There are 95 communities (chumchon) divided as follows: zone 1 - 17, zone 2 - 28, zone 3 - 31 and zone 4 - 19 communities.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Khon Kaen travel guide from Wikivoyage\nTourism Thailand official website", "infobox": {"name": "Khon Kaen", "official_name": "City of Khon Kaen<br />\u0e40\u0e17\u0e28\u0e1a\u0e32\u0e25\u0e19\u0e04\u0e23\u0e02\u0e2d\u0e19\u0e41\u0e01\u0e48\u0e19", "native_name": "{{lang|th|\u0e02\u0e2d\u0e19\u0e41\u0e01\u0e48\u0e19}}", "settlement_type": "[[List of municipalities in Thailand|City Municipality]]", "image_skyline": "Monument of King Rama IV at Khon Kaen University.JPG", "image_caption": "[[Rama IV]] monument, [[Khon Kaen University]]", "image_flag": "Khon Kaen Flag.png", "flag_size": "100px", "image_seal": "Seal Khon Kaen.png", "seal_size": "100px", "pushpin_map": "Thailand", "pushpin_label_position": "left", "pushpin_map_caption": "Location in [[Thailand]]", "pushpin_mapsize": "220", "subdivision_type": "[[List of sovereign states|Country]]", "subdivision_name": "Thailand", "subdivision_type1": "[[Provinces of Thailand|Province]]", "subdivision_name1": "[[Khon Kaen Province|Khon Kaen]]", "subdivision_type2": "[[Amphoe|District]]", "subdivision_name2": "[[Mueang Khon Kaen District|Muang Khon Kaen]]", "government_type": "City Municipality", "leader_title": "Mayor", "leader_name": "Thirasak Thikhayuphan<br>(since Sept 2012)", "established_title": "Town municipality", "established_date": "20 Aug 1935", "established_title1": "City municipality", "established_date1": "24 Sept 1995", "unit_pref": "Metric", "area_rank": "10th", "area_total_km2": "46", "elevation_m": "187", "population_as_of": "2019", "population_note": "Registered residents", "population_rank": "11th", "population_total": "114,459", "population_density_km2": "2,488", "timezone": "[[UTC+07:00|ICT]]", "utc_offset": "+7", "coordinates": "{{coord|16|26|N|102|50|E|region:TH|display|=|inline,title}}", "postal_code_type": "[[Postal codes in Thailand|Postcode]]", "postal_code": "40000", "area_code_type": "[[Telephone numbers in Thailand|Calling ode]]", "area_code": "043", "website": "{{URL|www.kkmuni.go.th}}"}, "wikidata": {"Commons category (P373)": "Khon Kaen", "country (P17)": "Thailand (Q869)", "coordinate location (P625)": [{"latitude": 16.433333333333, "longitude": 102.83333333333, "altitude": null, "precision": 0.016666666666667, "globe": "http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q2"}, {"latitude": 16.4297, "longitude": 102.8297, "altitude": null, "precision": 0.000277778, "globe": "http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q2"}], "topic's main category (P910)": "Category:Khon Kaen (Q8573308)", "Freebase ID (P646)": "/m/01cygw", "instance of (P31)": ["Thesaban Nakhon (Q15141632)", "big city (Q1549591)"], "located in the administrative territorial entity (P131)": "Mueang Khon Kaen (Q476023)", "Thailand central administrative unit code (P1067)": "4099", "GeoNames ID (P1566)": "1609776", "GND ID (P227)": "4240920-2", "native label (P1705)": "\u0e40\u0e17\u0e28\u0e1a\u0e32\u0e25\u0e19\u0e04\u0e23\u0e02\u0e2d\u0e19\u0e41\u0e01\u0e48\u0e19", "VIAF ID (P214)": "134993539", "population (P1082)": [{"amount": "+115928", "unit": "1"}, {"amount": "+113754", "unit": "1"}, {"amount": "+120957", "unit": "1"}], "page banner (P948)": "Khon Kaen Banner.jpg", "image (P18)": "Hotel in Khon Kaen.jpg", "IPA transcription (P898)": "k\u02b0\u0254\u030c(\u02d0)n k\u025b\u0300n", "WOEID (P1281)": "1226003", "official website (P856)": "http://www.kkmuni.go.th/", "official name (P1448)": "\u0e40\u0e17\u0e28\u0e1a\u0e32\u0e25\u0e19\u0e04\u0e23\u0e02\u0e2d\u0e19\u0e41\u0e01\u0e48\u0e19", "Quora topic ID (P3417)": "Khon-Kaen-Thailand", "area (P2046)": {"amount": "+46.00", "unit": "http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q712226"}, "Great Russian Encyclopedia Online ID (P2924)": "2126398", "seal image (P158)": "Seal of Khon Kaen.png", "postal code (P281)": "40000", "located in time zone (P421)": "UTC+07:00 (Q6940)", "elevation above sea level (P2044)": {"amount": "+162", "unit": "http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q11573"}, "capital of (P1376)": "Khon Kaen (Q327533)", "Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Online ID (P1417)": "place/Khon-Kaen", "Gran Enciclop\u00e8dia Catalana ID (P1296)": "0514852", "Who's on First ID (P6766)": "102025307", "WorldCat Identities ID (P7859)": "lccn-n89284983", "NKCR AUT ID (P691)": "ge307115", "coextensive with (P3403)": "Nai Mueang (Q16138088)", "Store norske leksikon ID (P4342)": "Khon_Kaen", "National Library of Israel J9U ID (P8189)": "987007562765905171", "Den Store Danske ID (P8313)": "Khon_Kaen"}, "cat": "City", "url": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khon_Kaen", "wikibase": "Q876526"}, {"name": "Ancient Kano City Walls", "url_name": "47573229", "txt": "The Ancient Kano City Walls (Hausa: Kofar Na'isa) were ancient defensive walls built to protect the inhabitants of the ancient city of Kano.

The Ancient Kano City Walls were described as \"the most impressive monument in West Africa\".\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Ancient Kano City Walls were built as a defensive wall with the construction of the foundation laid by Sarki Gijimasu (r. 1095\u20131134), the third king of the Kingdom of Kano in the Kano Chronicle. In the mid 14th century during the reign of Zamnagawa, the wall was completed before it was further expanded during the 16th century.

Spanish pronunciation: [sju\u02c8\u00f0a\u00f0 \u02c8xwa\u027ees] (listen)) is the  most populous city in the Mexican state of Chihuahua. It is commonly referred to as Ju\u00e1rez and was known as El Paso del Norte (The Pass of the North) until 1888. Ju\u00e1rez is the seat of the Ju\u00e1rez Municipality with an estimated population of 1.5 million people. It lies on the Rio Grande (R\u00edo Bravo del Norte) river, south of El Paso, Texas, United States. Together with the surrounding areas, the cities form El Paso\u2013Ju\u00e1rez, the second largest binational metropolitan area on the Mexico\u2013U.S. border (after San Diego\u2013Tijuana), with a combined population of over 2.7 million people.Four international points of entry connect Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez and El Paso: the Bridge of the Americas, the Ysleta\u2013Zaragoza International Bridge, the Paso del Norte Bridge, and the Stanton Street Bridge. Combined, these bridges allowed 22,958,472 crossings in 2008, making Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez a major point of entry and transportation into the U.S. for all of central northern Mexico. The city has a growing industrial center, which in large part is made up by more than 300 \"maquiladoras\" (assembly plants) located in and around the city. According to a 2007 New York Times article, Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez was \"absorbing more new industrial real estate space than any other North American city\". In 2008, fDi Magazine designated Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez \"The City of the Future\".\n\n\n== History ==\n\nAs 17th century Spanish explorers sought a route through the southern Rocky Mountains, the Franciscan Friar Garc\u00eda de San Francisco founded Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez in 1659 as \"El Paso del Norte\" (\"The North Pass\"). The Misi\u00f3n de Guadalupe de los Mansos en el Paso del r\u00edo del Norte became the first permanent Spanish development in the area in the 1660s, although Native American peoples were already present. The Franciscan friars established a community that grew in importance as commerce between Santa Fe and Chihuahua passed through it. The wood for the first bridge across the Rio Grande came from Santa Fe, New Mexico in the late 18th century. The original population of Mansos, Suma, Jumano, and other natives from the south brought by the Spanish from Central New Spain grew around the mission. In 1680 during the Pueblo Revolt, most of the Piro Pueblo and some of the Tiwa people branch of the Pueblo became refugees, A Mission was established for the Tigua in Ysleta del Sur. Piro Pueblo colonial era settlements along El Camino Real, south of the Guadalupe Mission, included Missions Real de San Lorenzo, Senec\u00fa del Sur, and Soccoro del Sur. Presidio del Nuestra Senora del Pilar del Paso del Rio Norte was established near the Mission in 1683.:\u200a39\u201396\u200aThe population of the entire district was close to 5,000 in 1750 when the Apache attacked the other native towns and ranchos around the missions. Additional Presidios were established to counter them. One Presidio, San Elzeario, was established near El Porvenir in 1774, where it remained until being moved in 1788 to what is now San Elizario, Texas where that settlement grew up around that Presidio. Another was Presidio de San Fernando de Carrizal, which was established in 1774 at the San Fernando settlement that became present-day Carrizal, Chihuahua.:\u200a39\u201340\u200aThe 1848 Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo established the Rio Grande as the border between Mexico and the United States. The main channel of the Rio Grande had moved southwestward leaving the settlements of Ysleta, Socorro, and San Elzeario on the Camino Real on the north bank of the river, isolated from the rest of the towns, in Texas.\n\nOther settlements on the east bank of the Rio Grande were not part of a town at that time; as the U.S. Army set up its installations settlements grew around it. This would later become El Paso, Texas. From that time until around 1930, populations on both sides of the border moved freely across it.In 1853, a new border adjustment occurred when the territory of La Mesilla was sold to the United States, with which the new border line after the Rio Grande began precisely in Paso del Norte, reinforcing its status as a border town.\nDuring the French intervention in Mexico (1862\u20131867), Benito Ju\u00e1rez's republican forces stopped temporarily at El Paso del Norte before establishing his government-in-exile in Chihuahua. After 1882, the city grew, in large part, because of the arrival of the Mexican Central Railway. Commerce thrived in the city as more banks began operating, telegraph and telephone services became available, and trams appeared. These commercial activities were under the firm control of the city's oligarchy, which consisted of the Ochoa, Samaniego, Daguerre, Provencio, and Cuar\u00f3n families. In 1888, El Paso del Norte was renamed in honor of Benito Ju\u00e1rez.\nThe city expanded significantly thanks to D\u00edaz's free-trade policy, creating a new retail and service sector along the old Calle del Comercio (now Vicente Guerrero) and September 16 Avenue. A bullring opened in 1899. The Escobar brothers founded the city's first institution of higher education in 1906, the Escuela Particular de Agricultura. That same year, a series of public works are inaugurated, including the city's sewage and drainage system, as well as potable water. A public library, schools, new public market (the old Mercado Cuauht\u00e9moc) and parks dotted the city, making it one of many Porfirian showcases. Modern hotels and restaurants catered to the increased international railroad traffic from the 1880s on. However, national and foreign opposition to the \"disloyal\" commercial rivalry of the free zone was not long in coming and the Mexican government was forced to modify the status of the free zone in 1891. To this must be added the worldwide devaluation of silver and water scarcity, which generated a severe economic crisis in the city, causing a significant number of workers to flee to the United States. As a result of the collapse of commercial activities and population, Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez focused on tourism as an economic activity at the beginning of the 20th century, particularly promoting \"diversions\", thus beginning \"the moment of scandal\"\n\nIn 1909, D\u00edaz and William Howard Taft planned a summit in Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez and El Paso, a historic first meeting between a Mexican and a U.S. president, and also the first time a U.S. president would cross the border into Mexico. But tensions rose on both sides of the border over the disputed Chamizal strip connecting Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez to El Paso, even though it would have been considered neutral territory with no flags present during the summit. The Texas Rangers, 4,000 U.S. and Mexican troops, U.S. Secret Service agents, FBI agents and U.S. marshals were all called in to provide security. Frederick Russell Burnham, the celebrated scout, was put in charge of a 250 private security detail hired by John Hays Hammond. On October 16, the day of the summit, Burnham and Private C.R. Moore, a Texas Ranger, discovered a man holding a concealed palm pistol standing at the El Paso Chamber of Commerce building along the procession route. Burnham and Moore captured, disarmed, and arrested the assassin within only a few feet of D\u00edaz and Taft.The city was Mexico's largest border town by 1910\u2014and as such, it held strategic importance during the Mexican Revolution. In May 1911, about 3,000 revolutionary fighters under the leadership of Francisco Madero laid siege to Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, which was garrisoned by 500 regular Federal troops under the command of General Juan J Navarro. Navarro's force was supported by 300 civilian auxiliaries and local police. After two days of heavy fighting most of the city had fallen to the insurrectionists and the surviving federal soldiers had withdrawn to their barracks. Navarro then formally surrendered to Madero. The capture of a key border town at an early stage of the revolution not only enabled the revolutionary forces to bring in weapons and supplies from El Paso, but marked the beginning of the end for the demoralized Diaz regime.During the subsequent years of the conflict, Villa and other revolutionaries struggled for the control of the town (and income from the Federal Customs House), destroying much of the city during battles in 1911 and 1913. Much of the population abandoned the city between 1914 and 1917. Tourism, gambling, and light manufacturing drove the city's recovery from the 1920s until the 1940s. A series of mayors in the 1940s\u20131960s, like Carlos Villareal and Ren\u00e9 Mascare\u00f1as Miranda, ushered in a period of high growth and development predicated on the PRONAF border industrialization development program. A beautification program spruced up the city center, building a series of arched porticos around the main square, as well as neo-colonial fa\u00e7ades for main public buildings such as the city health clinic, the central fire station, and city hall. The cathedral, built in the 1950s, gave the city center the flavor of central Mexico, with its carved towers and elegant dome, but structural problems required its remodeling in the 1970s. The city's population reached some 400,000 by 1970. In 1984, the city had a radiation incident after a private medical company illegally purchased a radiation therapy unit. It was dismantled, sold to a junkyard and later smelted to produce six thousand tons of rebar (which is used to reinforce buildings), exposing thousands to radiation.\n\nJu\u00e1rez has grown substantially in recent decades due to a large influx of people moving into the city in search of jobs with the maquiladoras. As of 2014 more technological firms have moved to the city, such as the Delphi Corporation Technical Center, the largest in the Western Hemisphere, which employs over 2,000 engineers. Large slum housing communities called colonias have become extensive.\nJu\u00e1rez has a long, notorious history of drug trafficking and the intense related violence. Mexico's first homegrown cartel, run by Ignacia Jasso, was seated in the city, and for a time controlled much of the border drug trade. Today the Ju\u00e1rez Cartel controls the routes in Juarez. Related violence in the city is responsible for more than 1000 unsolved murders of young women from 1993 to 2003.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nDue to its location in the Chihuahuan Desert and high altitude, Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez has a cold desert climate (K\u00f6ppen: BWk). Seasons are distinct, with hot summers, mild springs and autumns, and cold winters. Summer average high is 35 \u00b0C (95 \u00b0F) with lows of 21 \u00b0C (70 \u00b0F). Winter highs average 14 \u00b0C (57 \u00b0F) with lows of 0 \u00b0C (32 \u00b0F). Rainfall is scarce and greater in summer. Snowfalls occur occasionally (about 4 times a year), between November and March. On December 26/27, 2015, parts of the city received 40 cm (16 in) of snow within a 24-hour period beating the previous record of 28 cm (11 in) set in 1951. The record high is 49 \u00b0C (120 \u00b0F) and the record low is \u221223 \u00b0C (\u22129 \u00b0F).\n\n\n=== Cityscape ===\n\nCiudad Ju\u00e1rez has many affluent neighborhoods, such as Campestre, Campos El\u00edseos, and Misi\u00f3n de Los Lagos. Other neighborhoods, including Anapra, Chave\u00f1a, and An\u00e1huac, would be considered more marginal, while the remaining neighborhoods in Ju\u00e1rez represent the middle- to working-class, for example, Infonavit, Las Misiones, Valle de Ju\u00e1rez, Lindavista, Altavista, Guadalajara, Galeana, Flores Mag\u00f3n, Mariano Escobedo, Los Nogales, and Independencia.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nBetween the 1960s and 1990s, Ju\u00e1rez saw a high level of population growth due in part to the newly established maquiladoras. The end of the Bracero Program also brought workers back from border cities in the U.S. through Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, contributing to the growing number of citizens.The average annual growth in population over a 10-year period [1990\u20132000] was 5.3%.  According to the 2010 population census, the city had 1,321,004 inhabitants, while the municipality had 1,332,131 inhabitants. During the last decades the city has received migrants from Mexico's interior, some figures state that 32% of the city's population originate outside the state of Chihuahua, mainly from the states of Durango (9.9%), Coahuila (6.3%), Veracruz (3.7%) and Zacatecas (3.5%), as well as from Mexico City (1.7%). Though most new residents are Mexican, some also immigrate from Central American countries, such as Guatemala, Haiti, El Salvador, Honduras and Nicaragua.However, a March 2009 article noted there has been a mass exodus of people who could afford to leave the city due to the ongoing violence from the Mexican Drug War. The article quoted a city planning department estimate of over 116,000 abandoned homes, which could roughly be the equivalent of 400,000 people who have left the city due to the violence. A September 2010 article in The Guardian  said of Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez: \"About 10,670 businesses \u2013 40% of the total \u2013 have shut down. A study by the city's university found that 116,000 houses have been abandoned and 230,000 people have left.\"\n\n\n== Government ==\nThe city is governed by a municipal president and an 18-seat council. The president is Armando Cabada Alvidrez, who won as an Independent candidate in 2016. Six national parties are represented on the council: the PRI, the National Action Party, Ecologist Green Party of Mexico, Party of the Democratic Revolution, Labor Party and the New Alliance Party.\n\n\n=== Crime and safety ===\n\nViolence towards women in the municipality increased dramatically between 1993 and the mid-2000s, with approximately 370 girls and women murdered and at least 400 women reported missing. Escalating turf wars between the rival Ju\u00e1rez and Sinaloa Cartels led to increasingly brutal violence in the city beginning in 2007.In 2012, the Ju\u00e1rez police department dismissed approximately 800 officers in an effort to clean up corruption within its ranks.  Recruitment goals set by the department called for the force to more than double. In 2009, a vigilante group calling itself Ju\u00e1rez Citizens Command threatened to put a stop to all the perpetrators of violence if the government continued to fail to curb the violence in the city. Government officials expressed concern that such vigilantism would contribute to further instability and violence.In 2008, General Moreno and the Third Infantry Company took over the fight against the cartels in town. They were removed in 2009, with the general and 29 of his associates now in custody and awaiting trial for charges of murder and civil rights violations.In response to increasing violence in the city, the presence of the Mexican Armed Forces and Federal Police has almost doubled. By August 2009 there were more than 7500 soldiers augmented by an expanded and highly restaffed municipal police force.\n\nAs of 2019, Ju\u00e1rez's murder rate placed #2 of the highest reported in the world, at 104 murders per 100,000 inhabitants. An August 2008 GQ article described a dispirited and disorderly atmosphere that permeated the city, caused by multiple factors including drug violence, government corruption and poverty.\n\n\n=== Crime reduction ===\nAfter the homicide rates escalated to the point of making Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez the most violent city in the world, violent crime began to decline in the early 2010s. In 2012, homicides were at their lowest rate since 2007 when drug violence flared between the Sinaloa and Ju\u00e1rez Cartel. That trend has continued in 2015 with 300 homicides reported, the lowest number since 2006. Explanations for the rapid decline in violence include the Sinaloa Cartel's success in defeating its rivals, as well as federal, state and local government efforts to combat crime and improve the city's quality of life.The cause of the reduction in crime is the subject of speculation. One theory attributes it to deals the rival gangs made to coexist once the federal police were withdrawn in 2011. Another holds that a more powerful trafficking network, such as Joaquin \"El Chapo\" Guzman's Sinaloa cartel, might have moved in and restored a kind of \"order among thieves.\" Others attribute it to the end of the cartel war between Ju\u00e1rez and Sinaloa, the arrest or dismissal of many policemen with cartel ties, resolutions reached by liaisons between government and a group of local leaders called \"La Mesa de Seguridad y Justicia\", and the creation of an anti-extortion squad to combat extortion inflicted upon local companies. Crime was significantly reduced from 2010 to 2014, with 3,500 homicides in 2010 and 430 in 2014. In 2015, there were only 311 homicides.The decrease in crime inspired more business in the city. Some citizens who left because of the violence have since returned with their families. Many of them had moved their businesses to El Paso. In addition, U.S companies are investing more in Ju\u00e1rez. Community centers work with victims of crime and teach women how to defend themselves. Citizens have also formed neighborhood watch groups and patrol neighborhoods. \"La Fundacion Comunitaria de la Frontera Norte\" is giving young people career opportunities and giving people hope. Technology HUB is a startup incubator working to diversify the city's economy and move the regions low-skill manufacturing industry into an innovation cluster. Its economic development projects are in line with the research of University of Berkeley Professor Enrico Moretti. Innovation economies are found to be more adaptive to shifting tech and trade conditions and more resilient to the kind of civil unrest that plagued Ciudad Juarez in the past. City officials have said that they have plans to increase tourism in the city. For example, in April 2015, the city created a new campaign to increase tourism called \"Juarez is waiting for you\". That same month, U.S. representative Beto O'Rourke visited Ju\u00e1rez to give a speech about how much Ju\u00e1rez has changed for the better. A children's museum was opened in honor of the children who lost their parents during the violent years. Businesses that were closed because of the violence and extortion have reopened in recent years. The city's violence was depicted in the 2015 film Sicario, drawing criticism and calls for a boycott from Juarez mayor Enrique Serrano Escobar, who said the film presented a false and negative image of the city. He said the violence the film depicted was accurate through about 2010, and that the city had made progress in restoring peace.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\n\n=== Notable natives and residents ===\n\n\n=== In popular culture ===\nPart of the action of the 2015 film Sicario is set in Ju\u00e1rez.\nThe Bob Dylan song \"Just Like Tom Thumb's Blues\" is set in a nightmarish depiction of Ju\u00e1rez.\nCiudad Ju\u00e1rez and the female homicides which took place there are the inspiration for the city of Santa Teresa in Roberto Bolano's 2004 novel 2666.\nThe Way She Spoke is a play by Isaac Gomez based on his interviews with people affected by the femicide in Ju\u00e1rez, Mexico. A First Look at Isaac Gomez's The Way She Spoke Off-Broadway, Playbill, July 19, 2019.\n\"Invalid Litter Department,\" a song by El Paso band At the Drive-In, centers on the murders of women in Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez.\nThe majority of the events depicted in the 2007 videogame Tom Clancy's GRAW 2 take place in and around the city. This drew the ire of then Mayor H\u00e9ctor Murgu\u00eda Lardiz\u00e1bal,who accused the game's publisher Ubisoft of \"painting a negative picture of his city\".\n\n\n== Economy and infrastructure ==\nThe El Paso Regional Economic Development Corporation indicated that Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez is the metropolis absorbing \"more new industrial real estate space than any other North American city.\"  The Financial Times Group through its publication The Foreign Direct Investment Magazine ranked Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez as the \"City of the Future\" for 2007\u20132008. The El Paso\u2013Ju\u00e1rez area is a major manufacturing center. CommScope, Electrolux, Bosch, Foxconn, Flextronics, Lexmark, Delphi, Visteon, Johnson Controls, Toro, Lear, Boeing, Cardinal Health, Yazaki, Sumitomo, and Siemens are some of the foreign companies that have chosen Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez for business operations.The Mexican state of Chihuahua is frequently among the top five states in Mexico with the most foreign investment. Many foreign retail, banking, and fast-food businesses have locations within Ju\u00e1rez.\nIn the 1990s, traditional brick kilns made up a big part of the economic informal sector. These were typically located in the poorer regions of Ju\u00e1rez. The kilns used open-air fires, where certain materials that were burned generated a lot of air pollution. Along with rapid industrialization, small brick kilns have been a big contributor to the high amount of air pollution in Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez. While the Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez economy has largely been dependent on Maquiladora program, business leaders have undertaken initiatives to upskill and secure the city are larger stake in the global manufacturing economy. Technology Hub is a business incubator that works with regionally based companies, on programs in skill development, and the transition into automation and industry 4.0.\n\n\n=== Media ===\nJu\u00e1rez has four local newspapers: El Diario, El Mexicano, El PM and Hoy.  El Norte was a fifth, but it ceased operations on April 2, 2017, following the murder of journalist Miroslava Breach because, the paper explained, the recent killings of several Mexican journalists made the job too dangerous.\n\n\n==== Digital NewsPapers ====\nJrznoticias\nEl Diario\n\n\n=== Transportation ===\n\n\n==== Public bus system ====\nThe main public transportation system in the city is the public bus system. The public buses run the main streets of Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez throughout the day, costing eight pesos (less than 40 cents) to ride one. Due to the aging current bus fleet being considered potentially outdated, the municipal government is working on replacing the buses with new ones, along with improving the bus stops, such as by equipping them with shade.The ViveBus bus rapid transit (BRT) system opened to the public in November 2013 with the first route of five planned. The project was made a reality with the collaboration of the local municipal government, the private enterprise of Integradora de Transporte de Ju\u00e1rez (INTRA) as well as other city government agencies.  Studies have shown that the current bus system averages 8 mph (13 km/h) while the new system is projected to average 16 mph (26 km/h).  The BRT system studies conducted by the Instituto Municipal de Investigacion Y Planeacion project a daily ridership of 40,000.\nThe first of the five routes opened to users in late 2013 and is officially named Presidencia-Tierra Nueva and has 34 stations distributed along the north to south corridor.  The route starts at Avenida Francisco Villa, follows north to Eje Vial Norte-Sur then veers left at Zaragoza Blvd. and ends at Avenida Independencia and the elevated Carretera Federal 2.\n\n\n==== Airport ====\nThe city is served by Abraham Gonz\u00e1lez International Airport, with flights to several Mexican cities. It accommodates national and international air traffic for the city. Nearby El Paso International Airport handles flights to cities within the United States.\n\n\n==== International border crossings ====\n\nThe first bridge to cross the Rio Grande at El Paso del Norte was built in the time of New Spain, over 250 years ago, from wood hauled in from Santa Fe.  Today, this bridge is honored by the modern Santa Fe Street Bridge, and Santa Fe Street in downtown El Paso.\nSeveral bridges serve the El Paso\u2013Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez area in addition to the Paso Del Norte Bridge also known as the Santa Fe Street Bridge, including the Bridge of the Americas, Stanton Street Bridge, and the Ysleta Bridge also known as the Zaragoza Bridge.\nThere is also a land crossing at nearby Santa Teresa, New Mexico, and another one, the Tornillo - Guadalupe International Bridge located 50 km southeast of Juarez City.\n\n\n==== Rail ====\n\n\n===== Light rail =====\nEl Paso City Lines operated a streetcar system in Ju\u00e1rez from 1881 until 1974.\n\n\n===== Heavy rail =====\nMexico North Western Railway's subsidiary operation, the El Paso and Southwestern Railroad, extended into the US at El Paso, Texas but no longer operates passenger rail.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\nAccording to the latest estimates, the literacy rate in the city is in line with the national average: 97.3% of people above 15 years old are able to read and write.Ju\u00e1rez has about 20 institutions of higher learning Universidades en Ju\u00e1rez, Chihuahua: 20 : Sistema de Informaci\u00f3n Cultural-Secretar\u00eda de Cultura. The largest ones are among the following:\n1. The Instituto Tecnol\u00f3gico de Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez (ITCJ), founded in 1964, became the first public institution of higher education in the city.\n2. The Autonomous University of Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez (Universidad Aut\u00f3noma de Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, UACJ), founded in 1968, is the largest university in the city. It has several locations inside of the city including the Institute of Biomedical Sciences (Instituto de Ciencias Biom\u00e9dicas, ICB), the Institute of Social and Administrative Sciences (Instituto de Ciencias Sociales y Administrativas, ICSA), the Institute of Architecture, Design and Art (Instituto de Arquitectura, Dise\u00f1o y Arte, IADA), the Institute of Engineering and Technology (Instituto de Ingenier\u00eda y Tecnolog\u00eda, IIT) and the University City (Ciudad Universitaria, CU) located in the southern part of Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez. The IADA and IIT share the same location appearing to be a single institute where the students from both institutes share facilities as buildings or classrooms with the exception of the laboratories of Engineering and the laboratories of Architecture, Design and Arts. The UACJ also has spaces for Fine Arts and Sports.These latter services are considered among the best because they recluse nearly 30,000 participants in sports such as swimming, racquetball, basketball and gymnastics, and arts such as Classical Ballet, Drama, Modern Dance, Hawaiian and Polynesian Dances, Folk dance, Music and Flamenco. \n3. The Faculty of Political and Social Sciences of the Autonomous University of Chihuahua (Universidad Aut\u00f3noma de Chihuahua, UACH) which has delivered 70% of the city's media and news crew, is located in the city. \n4.

It also owns and operates the Discover and Pulse networks, and owns Diners Club International. Discover Card is the third largest credit card brand in the United States, when measured by cards in force, with nearly 50 million cardholders. Discover is currently headquartered in the Chicago suburb of Riverwoods, Illinois.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn 1981, Sears purchased the Dean Witter Reynolds brokerage firm organization and Coldwell, Banker & Company (real estate franchise) as an attempt to add financial services to its portfolio of customer services. In 1985, Sears also acquired the Greenwood Trust Company. Altogether, these companies operated as a Sears subsidiary called Dean Witter Financial Services Group, Inc. The plan to create a one-stop financial-services center in Sears stores was not as successful as Sears had hoped. Its credit card operations accounted for a loss of $22 million in the fourth quarter of 1986, and a loss of $25.8 million in the first quarter of 1987.On March 1, 1993, Sears sold off its financial services branch as a new independent publicly traded company called Dean Witter, Discover & Co. with Dean Witter Reynolds in charge. This company had a stock ticker symbol of DWD.\nIn 1995, Discover Card Services, Inc. changed its name to NOVUS Services, Inc. to distinguish its network functions from the Discover Card.\nIn 1997, this company merged with investment banking house Morgan Stanley to become Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, Discover & Co.\n\nOn February 1, 1999, the company rebranded itself as Discover Financial Services, Inc. The NOVUS logo was retired, replaced by the Discover Network logo.\nIn April 2005, Morgan Stanley announced that it would divest Discover Financial Services as an independent company within six months. By June, industry sources reported that Morgan Stanley was reassessing its plan to spin off Discover. In August, the company confirmed it would not sell Discover. However, on December 19, 2006 during a fourth quarter earnings report, Morgan Stanley CEO John J. Mack announced Discover would be spun off as a standalone publicly traded company by the end of August 2007, stating that both companies will be better positioned for growth and success as separate entities. Ahead of schedule on June 30, 2007, Discover was spun off as an independent, publicly traded company. It began trading on the NYSE for the first time on July 2 as DFS.\n\n\n== Acquisitions ==\n\n\n=== Acquisition of The Greenwood Trust Company ===\nThe Greenwood Trust Company was founded on August 30, 1911 and was based in Greenwood, Delaware. It was acquired in 1985 and renamed Discover Bank on August 1, 2000. Discover Bank is mainly an online financial institution that offers many financial services such as checking accounts, savings accounts, and money market accounts. However the first and original location of the Greenwood Trust Company on 502 East Market Street is still operating and is the only physical banking location of Discover Bank. Discover Bank operates as a subsidiary of Discover Financial Services and is FDIC insured.\n\n\n=== Acquisition of Pulse ===\nIn 2005, Discover Financial Services acquired Pulse, an interbank electronic funds transfer payments network. This allowed Pulse and its more than 4,000 member banks, credit unions, and savings institutions to join with the Discover Network's 4 million merchant and cash access locations. Additionally DFS now had the ability to market and issue debit and ATM cards. On February 13, 2006, DFS announced that it would begin offering Discover debit cards to other financial institutions, becoming the first credit card services company to compete directly with MasterCard and Visa in the rapidly growing signature debit market.\n\n\n=== Acquisition of Diners Club International ===\nIn April 2008, Discover Financial and Citigroup announced that Discover was purchasing the Diners Club International network from Citigroup for $165 million. In May 2008, the Federal Trade Commission approved the transaction and it was finalized on July 1, 2008. Discover stated that the Diners Club network, which is a major network outside the United States, will be merged with the Discover Network, a major network in the United States. The creation of an international network for Discover and Diners Club cardholders allowed customers to expand their global reach. Diners Club cards will continue to be issued by Diners Club International licensees. At this time, Discover Bank has no plans on issuing Diners Club branded cards itself.\n\n\n=== Acquisition of Student Loan Corporation ===\nOn September 17, 2010, Discover Financial Services announced it would acquire Citigroup-owned Student Loan Corporation for $30/share. The deal was finalized on December 31, renamed Discover Student Loans, and expanded DFS's market presence and origination capabilities in private student loans. In 2014, DFS launched Rewards for Good Grades, rewarding college and graduate students who get at least a 3.0 GPA (or equivalent) a one-time cash reward equal to 1% of the loan amount on each new Discover student loan. In 2015, DFS introduced an interactive tool called FAFSA assistant to help students and their families get ready to complete the FAFSA. The tool provides individualized tips and guidance based on personal situations.\n\n\n=== Acquisition of Home Loan Center ===\nOn June 6, 2012, Tree.com, Inc. completed the sale of substantially all of the operating assets of its Home Loan Center, Inc. business to a wholly owned subsidiary of Discover Financial. In exchange for the assets sold, Discover paid an aggregate of $45.9 million including payments made prior to the closing which were applied to the closing price.  On June 12, 2012, Discover began originating mortgages with its launch of Discover Home Loans, offering prime variable- and fixed-rate conventional and FHA home mortgage loans. The Home Loans business was later sold in 2015.\n\n\n== Business developments ==\nIn 1989, Discover Network signs its 1 millionth merchant, a restaurant called Vincente's Restaurant in Wilminton, Delaware.In 1995, DiscoverCard.com was launched where consumers could apply for credit cards, pay bills, redeem rewards, receive email reminders, and earn extra rewards through online retail partners.\nOn December 22, 1998, the company introduced Discover Platinum, a premium card featuring new ways to increase rewards, low balance transfer and annual percentage rates, no annual fee, and expanded credit lines.\nOn December 21, 2001, fourth-quarter income at Discover grew 31% to $193 million, compared with $147 million the year before.In 2002, Discover launched the industry's first keychain credit card. It was named the Discover 2GO Card and was recognized as one of the \"Best Products of 2002\" by editors and reporters from Business Week and USA Today.\nOn March 5, 2002, the company announced that the Account Center at Discovercard.com had registered over eight million card members, an increase of 61% since January 2001.On September 1, 2002, Discover announced that Citibank would accept the Discover\u00ae Card for cash advances at its approximately 450 Financial Centers and more than 2,000 ATM locations nationwide.In 2003, Discover introduced gas and miles rewards cards. The Gasoline Card (renamed Open Road in 2007) awarded 5% Cashback Bonus on gas purchases. The Miles Card by Discover card allowed redemption with as little as 2,500 miles for non-flight reward options. Discover also introduced the option for paperless statements to minimize the impact on the environment and reduce clutter for customers.\nIn October 2004, the Supreme Court upheld a ruling in Discover's favor that challenged exclusionary policies of Visa and MasterCard, stating that Mastercard and Visa were violating antitrust regulations with anticompetitive practices. Before this ruling, Visa and MasterCard would not allow banks to issue a Discover or American Express card if they issued a Visa or MasterCard. Within days of the court ruling, Discover filed a lawsuit in federal court seeking damages from Visa and MasterCard. In October 2008, DFS was awarded $2.75 billion in damages, the third largest settlement at the time in U.S. history. Shortly after the Supreme Court ruling, Discover struck its first deal to have its cards issued by another financial institution, GE Consumer Finance, which began to issue credit cards for retailer Walmart and its wholesale warehouse stores, Sam's Club. Transactions were processed on the Discover Network. Sam's Club exclusively accepted Discover for many years; since November 2006, it has also accepted MasterCard for purchases. In April 2014, Walmart announced that they were ending their relationship with Discover and would begin converting all Discover-branded cards to Mastercard beginning in June 2014.HSBC has issued Discover-branded credit cards processed through the Discover Network since its acquisition of card issuer Metris in late 2005. Metris had originally signed an agreement with Discover in September 2005, three months prior to the HSBC acquisition.\nIn 2006, Discover Network united with Visa, MasterCard, American Express, and JCB to form the Payment Card Industry (PCI) Security Standards Council, which helps to manage the ongoing payment account security throughout the transaction process. In this same year, DFS also launched the Discover Business Card, offering a single payment solution for small business owners. On July 14, 2006, DFS and First Data Corp., a global leader in electronic commerce and payment services, announced that First Data would offer Discover Network card services to small- and mid-sized merchants.\nOn March 13, 2007, Discover Financial Services announced the Discover Motiva card, the credit card that gives cardmembers cash rewards for making six on-time monthly payments in a row. This card was the industry's first credit card to give cash rewards for good credit management. Later in the year, DFS announced the Discover More card to replace the Discover Platinum card. The Discover More card was designed for consumers who use credit in many different categories and provided them with more ways to earn cash back on their purchases.\nFollowing the 2007-08 financial crisis, Discover received about $1.2 billion in bailout funds under the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP). The company announced in 2010 that it had received approval to pay back the funds.In 2009, Discover Financial Services introduced the Spend Analyzer tool, an innovative easy-to-use online tool that provides cardmembers with a visual representation of their Discover card purchases for the past 24 months.\nIn 2010, Discover Financial Services and Softcard announced a strategic partnership to build a mobile payment network that utilizes mobile phones to make point-of-sale purchases.\nIn September 2012, Discover Financial Services was ordered to pay over $200 million in fines and customer reimbursements to settle accusations by U.S. federal regulators that it had engaged in deceptive telemarketing tactics.In 2012, Discover Financial Services announced a five year, $10 million commitment called Pathway to Financial Success to help bring financial education curriculum to public high schools across the U.S.\nIn 2013, Discover Financial Services and PayPal partnered to enable millions of participating merchants to accept PayPal easily through their existing relationship with Discover. In the same year, Discover Cashback Checking was introduced. This checking account product paid customers 10 cents for every debit card purchase, online bill payment, and check written. Additionally in this same year, the Discover it card was announced. The card rewards cardmembers with 5% cash back in rotating categories each quarter like gas and restaurants. Discover also introduced Discover Home Equity Loans, offering homeowners the opportunity to simplify their finances inclusive of supporting home improvement projects, paying for major expenses, or consolidating debt into a single, fixed monthly payment. Discover also became the first major credit card issuer to provide free access to FICO Credit Scores based on TransUnion data directly to its cardmembers on their monthly statements. Additional information provided with their FICO Credit Scores were educational content to help them better understand their scores.\nIn 2014, Discover Financial Services launched Discover it Chrome for Students, allowing students to establish credit while earning 2% at gas stations and restaurants.\nIn 2015, Discover Financial Services launched Discover it Miles, which rewards 1.5 miles per dollar spent.\nIn 2016, Discover Financial Services launched Discover it Secured for consumers looking to build their credit. Additionally, DFS expanded FICO Credit Scores based on Experian data for free to everyone via a platform called Credit Scorecard, which also included a summary of the data that helps determine an individual's FICO Credit Score.\nIn 2017, Discover Financial Services launched a free service called Discover Identity Alerts to notify cardmembers if their social security numbers are found on risky websites and if any new accounts are opened on their Experian credit report. All of these services are offered at no cost and do not impact credit scores.\nIn 2018, Discover Financial Services announced a change to its checking account rewards program, a new industry-leading reward of 1% cash back on up to $3,000 in qualifying debit card purchases each month. Additionally DFS also introduced First Fee Forgiveness, a new program that automatically waives the first eligible fee each calendar year for certain Discover accounts. Eligible fees included in the program were inclusive of insufficient funds, stop payment, excessive withdrawal and Money Market minimum balance fees. For its U.S.-based employees, DFS launched the Discover College Commitment, which offers employees a full ride bachelor's degree program covering tuition, required fees, books, and supplies to select online degrees. On September 12, DFS launched the Discover it Business credit card, offering unlimited 1.5% cash back on all purchases, as well as free business and security features.\nIn 2019, Discover Financial Services' subsidiary Discover Bank eliminated most fees on all of its deposit products. Additionally, Discover Home Equity Loans surpassed $1 billion in funded loans, helping over 20,000 homeowners with their financial goals. DFS also launched contactless cards this year.\n\n\n== Advertising ==\nFrom 1998 to 2007, Discover Card owned a billboard at One Times Square, just above the flagpole where the Times Square Ball is placed, until Toshiba bought the space. As a result, its logo could be seen on national television during New Year's Eve, while the ball dropped. Discover also sponsored the ball drop itself.From its opening in 2001 to 2012, Sugarloaf Mills Mall in Lawrenceville, Georgia was named Discover Mills in a naming rights partnership with Discover Card. The slogan for the mall was \"Where Discover Card is the Smart Choice.\" It was the first shopping mall to have granted naming rights to interested companies.Since 2008, Discover has been the official credit-card partner of the National Hockey League. As part of this deal, Discover offers team- and league-branded credit cards as well as a 10% discount on purchases made from the NHL's online store using Discover.\nIn 2011 and 2012, Discover participated and won the Grand Marshal award for excellence in creative concept and design in the Tournament of Roses Parade in Pasadena.\nFrom 2011 to 2013, Discover was the sponsor of the college football Orange Bowl.\nIn 2013, Discover was the sponsor of the BCS National Championship.\nIn 2017, Discover was named the first ever presenting sponsor and official credit card of the Big Ten Football Conference and Championship Game as part of a multi-year sponsorship.\n\n\n== Business ==\nIn addition to its card products, Discover Financial Services also markets savings products, checking accounts, personal loans, student loans, identity protection, and home equity loans.\n\n\n== Competitors ==\nIn the United States, Discover, as a card network, competes primarily with Visa, MasterCard, and American Express. Unlike Visa and MasterCard, Discover directly issues its cards as both the card network and associated bank, through its Discover Bank unit. When measured by card balances, Discover is the sixth largest credit card issuer in the U.S. behind JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, Bank of America, Capital One and American Express, and ahead of Wells Fargo and U.S. Bank.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nDiscover Financial Services official corporate site\nDiscover all services official site\nDiscover Card official site\nDiscover Bank official banking services site\nDiscover Network official merchant, acquirer, and issuer services site\nDiscover Student Loans official private student loan site\nDiscover Home Loans official home mortgage loan site\nDiscover Personal Loans official personal lending site\nBusiness data for Discover Financial Services:", "infobox": {"name": "Discover Financial Services", "logo": "Discover Card logo.svg", "logo_size": "200px", "type": "[[Public company|Public]]", "traded_as": "{{ubl|NYSE|DFS|[[S&P 500]] component}} {{NYSE|DFS}}", "foundation": "{{Start date and age|1985}} (as a subsidiary of [[Sears]])", "founder": "[[Sears]]", "location_city": "[[Riverwoods, Illinois]]", "location_country": "U.S.", "key_people": "{{unbulleted list|Roger Hochschild |small|([[chief executive officer|CEO]])|[[David Nelms]] |small|(Executive Chairman)}} {{small|([[chief executive officer|CEO]])}} {{small|(Executive Chairman)}}", "industry": "[[Financial services]]", "products": "[[Payment system]]s, [[Credit card]]s, [[Finance]], [[Retail banking|Consumer banking]], Loans", "revenue": "{{decrease}} {{US$|12.95 billion|link|=|yes}} (2020)", "operating_income": "{{decrease}} US$1.44 billion (2020)", "net_income": "{{decrease}} US$1.14 billion (2020)", "assets": "{{decrease}} US$112.89 billion (2020)", "equity": "{{decrease}} US$10.88 billion (2020)", "num_employees": "17,600 (2020)", "subsid": "[[Diners Club International]]<br>[[Discover Bank]]<br>[[Discover Network]]<br>[[Pulse (interbank network)|Pulse]]", "parent": "{{unbulleted list|[[Dean Witter Reynolds]]|small|(1985\u20131997)|[[Morgan Stanley]] |small|(1997\u20132007)|[[Independent business|Independent]] |small|(2007\u2013present)}} {{small|(1985\u20131997)}} {{small|(1997\u20132007)}} {{small|(2007\u2013present)}}", "website": "{{URL|discoverfinancial.com}}"}, "wikidata": {"stock exchange (P414)": "New York Stock Exchange (Q13677)", "instance of (P31)": ["commercial organization (Q21980538)", "credit institution (Q730038)", "public company (Q891723)"], "headquarters location (P159)": "Riverwoods (Q2271100)", "inception (P571)": "+1985-00-00T00:00:00Z", "official website (P856)": "http://www.discover.com/", "country (P17)": "United States of America (Q30)", "industry (P452)": "financial service (Q837171)", "product or material produced (P1056)": ["payment system (Q986008)", "Discover Card (Q1228562)"], "ISNI (P213)": "0000 0000 9894 5854", "Ringgold ID (P3500)": "125512", "legal form (P1454)": "joint-stock company (Q134161)", "subsidiary (P355)": ["Diners Club International (Q877332)", "Discover Home Loans (Q98443202)"], "PermID (P3347)": "4295902718", "topic's main category (P910)": "Category:Discover Financial (Q30679813)", "founded by (P112)": "Sears (Q6499202)", "Library of Congress authority ID (P244)": "n2004108301", "VIAF ID (P214)": "146787159", "member of (P463)": "FIDO Alliance (Q15731702)", "Twitter username (P2002)": "discover", "director / manager (P1037)": "Roger C.

The promotion was founded in 1992 by Tod Gordon and in 1993, businessman Paul Heyman took over the creative end of the promotion from Eddie Gilbert and rechristened the promotion from Eastern Championship Wrestling to \"Extreme\" Championship Wrestling.\nThe promotion showcased various international styles of professional wrestling, ranging from lucha libre to puroresu and hardcore wrestling. Heyman's creative direction created new stars, and established the \"third\" big brand in the United States, competing with the billionaire-backed World Wrestling Federation and World Championship Wrestling promotions. HHG closed ECW in 2001 when it was unable to secure a new national television contract, and World Wrestling Entertainment, Inc. purchased the assets of the company from bankruptcy in January 2003.\nIn 2006, WWE relaunched the ECW franchise as a third brand with their existing Raw and SmackDown brands. It debuted on June 13, 2006 on Sci Fi in the United States and ran for close to four years until it aired its final episode on February 16, 2010 on the rebranded Syfy.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Tri-State Wrestling Alliance and NWA Eastern Championship Wrestling (1989\u20131994) ===\n\nECW had its origins in 1990 under the banner Tri-State Wrestling Alliance owned by Joel Goodhart. ECW would, in fact, continue to use the former Tri-State Heavyweight championship belt to represent its own Championship, although the ECW title was not considered a continuation of that title. In 1992, Goodhart sold his share of the company to his partner, Tod Gordon, who renamed the promotion Eastern Championship Wrestling. When Eastern Championship Wrestling was founded, it was not a member of the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA). At the time, \"Hot Stuff\" Eddie Gilbert, the lead booker of Eastern Championship Wrestling, had managed to secure television time on SportsChannel Philadelphia starting in April 1993. Gilbert, after a falling out with Tod Gordon, was replaced in September 1993 by  then-28 year old businessman Paul Heyman. Heyman, known on television as Paul E. Dangerously, had just been fired by World Championship Wrestling (WCW) and was looking for a new challenge.\n\n\n=== Secession from the NWA (1994) ===\n\nIn 1994, Jim Crockett's non-compete agreement with Ted Turner, who purchased World Championship Wrestling (WCW) from Crockett in November 1988, was up and he decided to start promoting with the NWA again. Crockett went to Tod Gordon and asked him to hold a tournament for the NWA's top prize, the NWA World Heavyweight Championship, in ECW's home area of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on August 27, 1994. NWA President Dennis Coralluzzo alleged that Crockett and Gordon were going to try to monopolize the title (akin to Crockett's actions in the 1980s) and stated Crockett did not have the NWA board's approval, which resulted in Coralluzzo personally overseeing the tournament. Gordon took offense at Coralluzzo for his power plays and began contemplating a plan to secede ECW from the NWA through a controversial and public manner that would attract attention to ECW and insult the NWA organization. Gordon planned to have Shane Douglas, who was scheduled to face 2 Cold Scorpio in the tournament finals on August 30, 1994, throw down the NWA World Heavyweight Championship belt upon winning as an act of defiance.\n\nTod Gordon and Paul Heyman originally planned the idea of throwing down the NWA World Heavyweight Championship belt. Heyman persuaded Douglas by noting that the negative would only be that NWA traditionalists would just see them as traitors to tradition. Adding to Douglas' decision was the animosity between Douglas and NWA President Dennis Coralluzzo, who at the time publicly criticized Douglas and told NWA affiliated bookers not to book Douglas for shows. Coralluzzo believed that Douglas was a \"bad risk\" and had the tendency to no-show events. Douglas ultimately decided to go through with Gordon and Heyman's plan, inspired by his father's motto of \"doing right by the people that do right by you.\" After looking up and saying, \"This is it tonight, Dad,\" Douglas threw down the NWA World Heavyweight Championship belt, stating that he did not want to be champion of a \"dead promotion\" that \"died seven years ago.\" He then raised the Eastern Championship Wrestling title belt and declared it to be a World Heavyweight Championship \u2013 calling it the only real world title left in professional wrestling. When recalling this event years later, Paul Heyman stated the following in a 1998 chat:\n\nThe National Wrestling Alliance was old-school when old-school wasn't hip anymore. We wanted to set our mark, we wanted to breakaway from the pack, we wanted to let the world know that we weren't just some independent promotion.Coralluzzo was interviewed after the event and declared that Douglas would be the world champion of the NWA \"whether he likes it or not\", calling Douglas' actions a \"disgrace\" and said he would move to have Douglas stripped of both the NWA World Heavyweight Championship and the Eastern Championship Wrestling Heavyweight Championship, calling him \"undeserving\" of both titles. Gordon made the following announcement on the next edition of NWA-ECW programming:\n\nI listened with great interest as the representative of the NWA board of directors took it upon himself to inform you that they have the power to force NWA-Eastern Championship Wrestling not to recognize The Franchise, Shane Douglas, as a world heavyweight champion. Well, as of noon today, I have folded NWA-Eastern Championship Wrestling. In its place will be ECW- Extreme Championship Wrestling- and we recognize The Franchise, Shane Douglas, as our World Heavyweight Champion. And we encourage any wrestler in the world today to come to the ECW to challenge for that belt. This is the ECW, Extreme Championship Wrestling, changing the face of professional wrestling.\nThe promotion showcased many different styles of professional wrestling, including hardcore wrestling matches as well as lucha libre and Japanese wrestling styles.\n\n\n=== ECW Arena and television syndication (1994\u20132001) ===\n\nThe bulk of ECW's shows remained at the ECW Arena, a former warehouse secluded under a section of Interstate 95. Seating comprised simple folding chairs and four sets of portable bleachers, with the unconventional scene reflective of the gritty style of the promotion itself. Shows were broadcast on a Philadelphia local cable sports station (SportsChannel America's local affiliate, SportsChannel Philadelphia) on Tuesday evenings. After Sports Channel Philadelphia went off the air in 1997, the show moved to WPPX-TV 61. It later moved to a former independent broadcast station (WGTW 48) in Philadelphia on either Friday or Saturday night, and at 1:00 a.m. or at 2:00 a.m. Shows were also aired on the MSG Network in NYC on Friday nights (early Saturday morning) at 2:00 a.m. Due to the obscurity of the stations and ECW itself, as well as the lack of FCC oversight at that late hour, many times expletives and violence were not edited out of these showings, along with extensive use of copyrighted music and music videos.\n\n\n=== Paul Heyman and cross promotion with the WWF and the USWA (1996\u20131997) ===\n\nIn 1995, Tod Gordon sold Extreme Championship Wrestling, Inc., to his head booker, Paul Heyman, trading as HHG Corporation. Afterward, Gordon remained in ECW as a figurehead commissioner. Years after being the ECW \"Commissioner\", Gordon left ECW in May 1997, his absence was explained on-air that he retired from wrestling due to family. Rumors circulated, however, that Gordon was fired by Heyman after he was suspected as a \"locker room mole\" for a rival wrestling promotion, helping to lure talent to World Championship Wrestling.\n\nStoryline-wise, Vince McMahon first became \"aware\" of ECW while at the 1995 King of the Ring event in ECW's home base of Philadelphia. During the match between Mabel and Savio Vega, the crowd suddenly started to chant, \"ECW! ECW! ECW!\". On September 22, 1996, at the In Your House: Mind Games event in Philadelphia, ECW stars The Sandman, Tommy Dreamer, Paul Heyman, and Taz were in the front row with Sandman even interfering in one match (when he threw beer on Savio Vega during his strap match with Bradshaw). McMahon acknowledged ECW's status as a local, up and coming promotion on the air. The following night on WWF Monday Night RAW, broadcast on September 23, 1996, at the onset of a match between The Bodydonnas vs. The British Bulldog and Owen Hart, Bill Alfonso, and Tazz could be seen invading the program. Both Tazz and Alfonso were able to successfully jump the security rails, and Tazz was able to prominently display a bright orange sign with black lettering that read \"Sabu Fears Tazz-ECW\". On February 24, 1997, ECW \"invaded\" Raw from the Manhattan Center. They advanced a storyline, plugged their first ever pay-per-view and worked three matches in front of the WWF audience while McMahon called the action with both Jerry \"The King\" Lawler and Paul Heyman. The Manhattan Center in New York was peppered with a large number of ECW fans, who gave the WWF wrestlers \"Boring!\" chants when they felt it was warranted. Likewise, when the ECW performers arrived, they popped and introduced the WWF Monday night audience to some trademark ECW group chants. This invasion sparked an inter-promotional feud between ECW and Lawler's United States Wrestling Association. Lawler disparaged ECW on-camera and convinced wrestlers such as Rob Van Dam and Sabu to join him in an anti-ECW crusade. Throughout 1997, ECW wrestlers appeared on USWA television programs, and vice versa. As part of the working relationship between ECW and the WWF, a number of WWF-contracted wrestlers were sent to ECW for seasoning in 1997, including Droz and Brakkus.On April 13, 1997 ECW broadcast their first pay-per-view (PPV) wrestling card Barely Legal, highlighted by Terry Funk defeating Raven to win the ECW World Heavyweight Championship. In June 1997, the company's Wrestlepalooza '97 event featured Raven's final ECW match before leaving for WCW. In this match, Tommy Dreamer finally beat Raven, his longtime nemesis. Dreamer's celebration was short-lived, though, as Jerry Lawler, along with Sabu and Rob Van Dam showed up to attack Dreamer. This set up a match between Dreamer and Lawler at the pay-per-view, 1997 Hardcore Heaven, on August 17, which was won by Dreamer. ECW continued through 1998 and early 1999 with a string of successful pay-per-views.\n\n\n=== ECW on TNN, Mike Awesome controversy and promotional rivalry (2000) ===\n\nIn August 1999, ECW began to broadcast nationally on TNN (for what was initially a three-year contract) as ECW on TNN. Despite very limited advertising, low budget, and disputes with the broadcaster (reflected on The Network stable), ECW became TNN's highest rated show and bolstered the network's Friday night slot, both in ratings and line-up. In April 2000, Mike Awesome made a surprise appearance on WCW Monday Nitro-- making his debut by attacking Kevin Nash-- while still reigning as ECW World Heavyweight Champion. Mike Awesome's friend Lance Storm has said that Awesome refused to sign a new contract with ECW until Paul Heyman paid him overdue wages. There were rumors that WCW Executive Vice-President Eric Bischoff wanted Awesome to drop the ECW World Championship belt in the trash can on television, as had been done previously with the WWF Women's title by Madusa when she jumped from the WWF to WCW. After Paul Heyman filed an injunction, WCW refrained from having Awesome appear on Nitro with the belt, but did acknowledge him as the champion. Eventually, a compromise was reached. Awesome (a WCW employee and the reigning ECW World Heavyweight champion) appeared at an April 13, 2000 ECW event in Indianapolis, Indiana, where he lost the title to Tazz (who was working for the World Wrestling Federation).In July 2000, ECW made its West Coast debut, holding its annual summer pay-per-view ECW Heat Wave in Los Angeles. At the time Los Angeles was home to Xtreme Pro Wrestling (XPW), and its owner Rob Black purchased six front row tickets for the show. The tickets were given to a cadre of XPW talent, and their mission was to make it clear that ECW was on enemy turf; it was not part of either companies' storylines. At the beginning of the main event, the XPW contingent donned shirts emblazoned with the XPW logo, gaining the attention of security and ECW wrestler Tommy Dreamer. Security ejected the XPW group from the building and later, a brawl broke out in the parking lot between members of the XPW ring crew and the ECW locker room. The XPW wrestlers were not involved in the fracas, during which the ECW wrestlers brutalized the XPW ring crew with several of the ring crew members left in pools of their own blood. Initial reports claimed that XPW valet Kristi Myst had somehow touched ECW valet Francine Fournier and that this is what prompted the incident, but Fournier herself has since gone on record as saying that she was never grabbed or in any other way touched by any of the XPW crew, and other eyewitnesses support the story that Fournier never had a hand laid on her. XPW was not acknowledged by ECW announcer Joey Styles during the pay-per-view telecast, however at the November to Remember pay-per-view a few months later, color-commentator Don Callis made a subtle reference to the incident, describing a wild brawl as \"looking like a Los Angeles parking lot.\" The XPW contingent at ringside consisted of wrestlers The Messiah, Kid Kaos, Supreme, Kristi Myst, Homeless Jimmy and XPW announcer Kris Kloss.\n\n\n=== Decline (2000\u20132001) ===\nBy 2000, financial problems began rocking the company; that October, ECW on TNN was cancelled (with the final episode airing on October 6, 2000) in favor of WWF Raw is War moving to the network. Paul Heyman stated he believed that the inability to land another national television deal was the cause of ECW's demise.\n\nECW struggled for months after the cancellation, trying to secure a new national television deal. On December 30, 2000, ECW Hardcore TV aired for the last time and the January 7, 2001 broadcast of Guilty as Charged was the company's last PPV. The promotion's January 13, 2001 show in Pine Bluff, Arkansas would prove to be its final event of any kind. Living Dangerously was scheduled to air on March 11, 2001, but because of financial trouble it was canceled in February. Heyman could not get out of financial trouble and ECW closed on April 4, 2001. Heyman, who became color commentator for Raw that February (replacing Jerry Lawler, who quit WWF in protest after his then-wife, Stacy Carter, had been fired by McMahon), had supposedly never told his wrestlers that the company was on its last legs and was unable to pay them for a while. Heyman also noted in later years that he had made an effort to put ECW on the USA Network (then the former home of Raw) and that this effort was thwarted after McMahon sent an email which pressured USA Network executives to put ECW on the network. The company was listed as having assets totaling $1,385,500. Included in that number was $860,000 in accounts receivable owed the company by In Demand Network (PPV), Acclaim (video games) and Original San Francisco Toy Company (action figures). The balance of the assets were the video tape library ($500,000), a 1998 Ford truck ($19,500) and the remaining inventory of merchandise ($4). The liabilities of the company totaled $8,881,435.17. Wrestlers and talent were listed, with amounts owed ranging from $2 for Sabu and Steve Corino to hundreds, and in some cases, thousands of dollars. The highest amounts owed to talents were Rob Van Dam ($150,000), Shane Douglas ($145,000), Tommy Dreamer ($100,000), Joey Styles ($50,480), Rhyno ($50,000), and Francine Fournier ($47,275). On January 28, 2003, World Wrestling Entertainment Inc. purchased ECW's assets from HHG Corporation in court, acquiring the rights to ECW's video library.\n\n\n== Legacy and return ==\n\nIn ECW, there were virtually no rules. The role of referees only included counting pinfalls, acknowledging submissions, and upholding rope breaks. ECW was known for making popular several types of matches, including the 3-Way Dance, barbed wire match, tables match and Singapore Cane match among others. According to Heyman, ECW was the first victim of the \"Monday Night Wars\" between WCW Monday Nitro and Monday Night Raw. The WWF had a working relationship with ECW, going so far as to participate in cross-promotional angles, providing talent on loan in exchange for developed young talent and marketable gimmicks (Al Snow's \"head\" gimmick among them) and even providing financial aid to Heyman for a considerable period of time. WCW on the other hand, refused to even mention ECW by name (with a few notable exceptions; including a passing remark by Raven in late 1997 and Nash and Scott Hall mentioning it as a viable second option in American wrestling in a slight on their main competition, the World Wrestling Federation). It was referred to as \"barbed wire city\" and \"a major independent promotion that wrestled in bingo halls\" during a segment directed at Diamond Dallas Page. The former ECW Arena, now known as the 2300 Arena, is host to the Hardcore Hall of Fame, which recognizes its history with hardcore wrestling.\n\n\n=== The Alliance ===\n\nA few months after the promotion's 2001 demise, ECW resurfaced as a stable as part of the World Wrestling Federation Invasion storyline. On the July 9, 2001 edition of Raw, Heyman, who had been hired by the WWF as Raw color commentator while ECW was still in bankruptcy proceedings, joined several former ECW alumni on the WWF roster (including the debuting Rob Van Dam and Tommy Dreamer) and claimed that he was bringing ECW back to participate in the Invasion by themselves (at the time, however, the ownership of ECW, including the use of its name on-air, was disputed despite Heyman still technically owning the company when he jumped ship to the WWF. In addition, WWF faced legal action by Harry Slash & The Slashtones for the use of the song \"This Is Extreme!\" which was eventually settled). Before Raw was over that evening, Heyman and Shane McMahon, who had (kayfabe) purchased World Championship Wrestling (WCW), revealed that they were in cahoots with each other and that Heyman had (also kayfabe) sold ECW to Stephanie McMahon, forming The Alliance to try and wrestle power from Vince McMahon. At that time, the inter-promotional feud shifted into an internal power struggle among the McMahon family. The defection of WWF superstars to The Alliance continued the shift as less focus was placed on WCW and ECW performers-- in fact, with rare exceptions such as Van Dam, the ECW alumni in The Alliance were given even less focus than WCW's performers. The feud lasted six months and concluded with WWF defeating The Alliance at the 2001 Survivor Series when Kurt Angle attacked Stone Cold Steve Austin, allowing Dwayne Johnson (a.k.a. \"The Rock\"), who had himself gotten attacked by Chris Jericho during the match (trying to help The Alliance in the process), to get the winning pinfall. The WWF's victory also marked the end of the Invasion storyline and WCW and ECW wrestlers were reintegrated into the WWF. The following night after Survivor Series, the WWF began the Ruthless Aggression Era despite the company using its Attitude slogans.\n\n\n=== Documentaries ===\nOn January 28, 2003, World Wrestling Entertainment Inc. purchased ECW's assets from HHG Corporation in court, acquiring the rights to ECW's video library. They used this video library to put together a two-disc DVD titled The Rise and Fall of ECW. The set was released in November 2004. The main feature of the DVD was a near three-hour documentary on the company's history, with the other disc featuring 7 matches from the promotion. An unauthorized DVD called Forever Hardcore was written, directed and produced by former WCW crew member Jeremy Borash in response to The Rise and Fall of ECW. The DVD had stories of wrestlers who were not employed by WWE telling their side of ECW's history.  During the week of November 10, 2014, WWE had ECW Week on the WWE Network featuring the ECW Exposed special hosted by Joey Styles and Paul Heyman.\n\n\n=== Reunions and relaunch ===\n\n\n==== WWE ====\n\nBy 2005, WWE began reintroducing ECW through content from the ECW video library and a series of books, which included the release of The Rise and Fall of ECW documentary. With heightened and rejuvenated interest in the ECW franchise, WWE organized ECW One Night Stand on June 12, a reunion event that featured ECW alumni. Shane McMahon had the idea of an online, low budget show, but they asked television stations and PPV producers and they were interested in ECW. Due to the financial and critical success of the production, WWE produced the second ECW One Night Stand on June 11, 2006, which served as the premiere event in the relaunch of the ECW franchise as a WWE brand, complementary to Raw and SmackDown. On June 13, Heyman, the brand's former owner and newly appointed figurehead for the ECW brand, recommissioned the ECW World Heavyweight Championship to be the brand's world title and awarded it to Rob Van Dam as a result of winning the WWE Championship at ECW One Night Stand 2006. The brand would continue to operate until February 16, 2010, where it became defunct and replaced with NXT. Under the WWE banner, ECW was presented following the same format of the other brands, with match rules, such as count outs and disqualifications, being standard. Matches featuring the rule set of the ECW promotion were classified as being contested under \"Extreme Rules\" and were only fought when specified.\n\n\n==== Other reunions ====\nOn the same weekend as the ECW One Night Stand 2005 event another reunion show was held at the ECW Arena. Booked and promoted by Shane Douglas, Cody Michaels and Jeremy Borash, Hardcore Homecoming was held on June 10, 2005.  Because of the success of the initial event a tour was planned, and later the DVD documentary Forever Hardcore was released by the same production crew as a counterpart to WWE's Rise and Fall of ECW.\n\nFollowing Tommy Dreamer's debut in Total Nonstop Action Wrestling, a new stable was formed called EV2.0 consisting of former ECW alumni. TNA President Dixie Carter agreed to give the stable their own reunion show at TNA's annual Hard Justice pay-per-view. Billed as the last ECW reunion show, Hardcore Justice aired on August 8, 2010. EV2.0 remained on the active roster for the remainder of the year. The Extreme Rising promotion featured many ECW alumni as well as younger talent and embraced the hardcore style of the original ECW. Their first show, Extreme Reunion, took place on April 28, 2012. It was result of the team of Douglas, Michaels, Kevin Kleinrock and Steve and Michael O'Neil. In 2012, Dreamer founded House of Hardcore, a wrestling promotion named after the ECW wrestling school and inspired by the hardcore style of wrestling. Since then, HOH has held numerous wrestling events mainly in areas where ECW was held such as the ECW Arena.\n\n\n== Championships and programming ==\n\n\n=== Championships ===\n\n\n=== Programming ===\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nList of former Extreme Championship Wrestling personnel\nList of ECW supercards and pay-per-view events\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nHardcore History: The Extremely Unauthorized Story of ECW (ISBN 1-59670-021-1) \u2013 Scott Williams\nThe Rise and Fall of ECW (ISBN 1-4165-1058-3) \u2013 Thom Loverro for World Wrestling Entertainment\nTurning the Tables (ISBN 1-905363-78-8) \u2013 John Lister\nSex, Drugs, and Wrestling \u2013 The Truth, The Lies, and the Extreme \u2013 a Rob Van Dam story \u2013 Tod Gordon\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nOfficial Website of World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE)'s Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW)\nHardcore Memories - ECW Nostalgia and History\nWrestling-Titles.com: ECW\nSolie.org - ECW Title Histories\nThe Wrestling Follower - Eastern Championship Wrestling Results Archive\n100th Episode in ECW-WWE era and The Mass Transit Incident (Spanish)\nECW Information at Pro-Wrestling Edge", "infobox": {"name": "Extreme Championship Wrestling", "image": "[[File:Ecw logo2001.png|220px]]", "type": "[[Private company|Private]]", "fate": "Bankruptcy, assets acquired by [[WWE|World Wrestling Entertainment Inc.]]", "former_name": "{{unbulleted list|Eastern Championship Wrestling Inc.

It is a leading manufacturer of infant formula both domestically and globally with its flagship product Enfamil. The company dates back to a firm created by Edward Mead Johnson, one of the co-founders of Johnson & Johnson, who created his own business in 1895, which was renamed Mead Johnson & Company in 1905. The company was majority owned by Bristol-Myers Squibb after an acquisition in 1967, but was spun-off in 2009 as an independent firm. Almost products were used by infants and children under 7, But Enfaschool which covers students from childhood to youth under 15 years.\nIn the year end 31 December 2016, Mead Johnson reported net sales of $3,743 million. Fifty percent of those sales were generated in Asia, 17% in Latin America and 33% in North America/Europe. For the same time period, the company reported total assets of $4,088 million.\nIn February 2017, British consumer goods company Reckitt (then known as Reckitt Benckiser at the time) bid $16.7 billion for the company.

As a result, MJN's common stock is no longer traded on the New York Stock Exchange, effective the announcement date.\n\n\n== History and products ==\n\nEdward Mead Johnson had founded Johnson & Johnson in 1886 together with his brothers. In 1895, Johnson developed a side business called The American Ferment Company to create a digestive aid. In 1897, E. Mead Johnson left the family business to go out into business on his own in Jersey City, New Jersey, and in 1905, the company was re-established as Mead Johnson & Company. The firm's first major infant formula was developed in 1910, and Dextri-Maltose, a carbohydrate-based milk modifier was introduced in 1911, making it the first American product for infants to be clinically approved and recommended by doctors. The firm moved to Evansville, Indiana, in 1915, in the wake of World War I, as part of an effort to have easier access to the raw agricultural ingredients that were needed for its products, which required Johnson to build a series of new plants and factories to replace the ones he had left behind in New Jersey.Edward Mead Johnson died in 1934, and Lambert Mead Johnson succeeded his father as president, and served in the position until 1955, making him the longest-serving president in company history. D. Mead Johnson was the third generation of the family to serve as chief executive of the firm. During his tenure, which lasted from 1955 until the firm's takeover by Bristol-Myers in 1968, the firm's annual sales tripled to $131 million, and grew to nearly 4,400 employees.\n\n\n=== Acquisition and spin-off from Bristol-Myers ===\nBristol-Myers reached agreement in August 1967 for a deal under which Mead Johnson would be acquired, with shareholders receiving a mix of common and preferred stock in a deal valued at $240 million. Mead Johnson's net sales in 1966 were $131 million with earnings of $7.3 million.Bristol-Myers announced in February 2009 that it was going to spin off Mead Johnson to focus on its primary pharmaceutics business, with an initial public offering estimated to bring in $562.5 million and would leave Bristol-Myers with 90% ownership of the firm. A plan offered in November 2009 would allow shareholders of Bristol-Myers to exchange one dollar of stock in that company for $1.11 worth of shares in Mead Johnson for the 133.5 million shares in the firm, which would value the company at $7.7 billion based on the stock's then current closing price. The stock swap was intended to provide a tax-free exchange. CEO James M. Cornelius of Bristol-Myers said that \"With a successful execution of this split-off, we fully consider ourselves a BioPharma company\".\n\n\n=== Acquisition by Reckitt Benckiser ===\nIn February 2017 it was announced that Reckitt Benckiser (RB) was in advanced negotiations to acquire Mead Johnson. On February 10, 2017, Reckitt Benckiser Group announced it had agreed to buy Mead Johnson Nutrition Co. for $16.6 billion.RB's intention was to acquire Mead Johnson Nutrition for $90 per share in cash. In order to effect the transaction, RB incorporated a subsidiary in Delaware into which Mead Johnson Nutrition has merged, with Mead Johnson Nutrition being the surviving entity at completion.Mead Johnson announced on June 12, 2017 that the final regulator approval to complete the acquisition had been received.

Broadridge supplies public companies with proxy statements, annual reports and other financial documents, and shareholder communications solutions, such as virtual annual meetings.\n\n\n== History ==\nLegislation passed in the mid-1970s in the United States mandates two processes affecting securities and their transfer: immobilisation and later, dematerialisation - the first requires paper securities to be kept in one central location and their ownership to be changed through transactions, rather than the piece of paper itself being transferred, and the second allows ownership to be simply recorded electronically without any paper certificate being created at all. These changes were made to allow more trades to happen, and for them to happen faster, in response to demand from the markets.  These changes also had the effect of separating companies from their shareholders, and putting intermediaries between them.:\u200a1\u20132\u200aImmobilization led to greater need for such intermediaries and created a new situation where shareholders voted by proxy instead of directly, and this in turn led a new industry to manage the shareholder voting process.:\u200a1\u20132,\u200a48\u200a  Prior to this industry transformation, banks and brokers typically maintained in-house proxy departments for handling these processes.  Even after the move to electronic certificates eliminated the need for intermediaries, they have persisted.:\u200a1\u20132\u200aThe proxy voting and shareholder communications services industry was, by the mid-1990s, dominated by Automatic Data Processing (ADP).:\u200a48\u200a  At the end of March, 2007, ADP spun-out the entirety of their shareholder communications activities, resulting in the formation of Broadridge Financial Solutions.:\u200a27\u200aIn the wake of the financial crisis of 2007\u20132008, Congress evaluated many aspects of corporate governance, including shareholder communications and proxy voting.:\u200a1\u20132\u200a In 2010 testimony by a vice president of NERA Economic Consulting and Jonathan R. Macey noted with alarm the near monopoly position of Broadridge in handling proxy voting.:\u200a249\u200a  In 2010, the company processed about 350 billion shares for the companies for which it provided services.:\u200a2\u200a  By 2013, the company had retained its predominant position in the proxy processing market.:\u200a17\u200aIn the summer of 2016, Broadridge acquired the North America Customer Communications (NACC) unit of DST Systems, a Kansas City-based business services provider, which provided the company with addressing information for about 75% of all public company shareholders in the United States and Canada.  Later in 2016, Broadridge bought M&O Systems, a small Manhattan-based financial services company. In 2016, the company acquired Spence Johnson, an institutional financial flow data intelligence firm co-founded by CEO at the time, Magnus Spence. This was a strategic investment by Broadridge, allowing for the combination of Broadridge's retail data and analytics with Spence Johnson's data and analytics focused on money flows between firms, two distinct intelligence dimensions. In November 2019, Broadridge announced their acquisition of ClearStructure Financial Technology, a global provider of portfolio management solutions for the private debt markets. In March 2020, Broadridge completed its acquisition of FundsLibrary, a leader in fund document and data dissemination in the European market.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of S&P 500 companies\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nKaul, Asha (2012). \"Chapter 2.

Spun off from the Holiday Corp. in December 1989 as Promus Companies, the company became Promus Hotel Corporation in 1995 after the firm's gambling interests were spun off as Harrah's Entertainment. Promus Hotel Corp. ceased to exist after its purchase by Hilton Hotels Corporation in 1998.\n\n\n== History ==\nPromus Hotel Corporation's beginnings are tied to the original Holiday Corp., which was based in Memphis, Tennessee.  Holiday Corp. owned the Holiday Inn hotel chain, but significantly higher competition in the hotel industry and a 1987 financial restructuring that left Holiday Corp. heavily in debt prompted Holiday to sell in August 1989 its Holiday Inn chain (including Crowne Plaza) for $2.23 billion to Bass PLC, a large British brewing concern. This left Holiday Corp. with several far more profitable core gambling and hotel brands, including Harrah's Entertainment, Embassy Suites Hotels, Homewood Suites, and Hampton Inn. In December 1989, Holiday Corp. spun off its hotels as stand-alone Promus Companies.

Veal or pork cordon bleu is made of veal or pork pounded thin and wrapped around a slice of ham and a slice of cheese, breaded, and then pan fried or baked. For chicken cordon bleu chicken breast is used instead of veal. Ham cordon bleu is ham stuffed with mushrooms and cheese.\n\n\n== Name ==\nThe French term cordon bleu is translated as \"blue ribbon\". According to Larousse Gastronomique cordon bleu \"was originally a wide blue ribbon worn by members of the highest order of knighthood, L'Ordre des chevaliers du Saint-Esprit, instituted by Henri III of France in 1578. By extension, the term has since been applied to food preparation to a very high standard and by outstanding cooks. The analogy no doubt arose from the similarity between the sash worn by the knights and the ribbons (generally blue) of a cook's apron.\"\n\n\n== History ==\nThe origins of cordon bleu as a schnitzel filled with cheese are in Brig, Switzerland, probably about the 1940s, first mentioned in a cookbook from 1949. The earliest reference to \"chicken cordon bleu\" in The New York Times is dated to 1967, while similar veal recipes are found from at least 1955.\n\n\n== Variants ==\n\nThere are many variations of the recipe involving cutlet, cheese, and meat. A popular way to prepare chicken cordon bleu is to butterfly cut a chicken breast, place a thin slice of ham inside, along with a thin slice of a soft, easily melted cheese. The chicken breast is then rolled into a roulade, coated in bread crumbs, and then deep-fried. Other variations exist with the chicken baked rather than fried.\nOther common variations include omitting the bread crumbs, wrapping the ham around the chicken, or using bacon in place of ham.A variant popular in the Asturias province of Spain is cachopo, a deep-fried cutlet of veal, beef or chicken wrapped around a filling of Serrano ham and cheese. In Spain, the version made with chicken is often called san jacobo.\nA common variant in Uruguay and Argentina is the Milanesa Rellena. It consists of two beef or chicken fillets passed through beaten egg, later, stuffed with cooked ham and mozzarella cheese and superimposed like a sandwich. Once this is done, they are again passed through beaten eggs and breadcrumbs, to be fried or baked. It is usually served with papas fritas (French fries) as a garnish.\nIn largely Muslim-populated countries, the halal versions of chicken cordon bleu are also popular, such that the chicken is rolled around beef or mutton instead of pork product.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n\n== References ==", "infobox": {"name": "Cordon bleu", "image": "Cordon-bleu-2.jpg", "image_size": "250px", "caption": "A schnitzel cordon bleu, as served in Switzerland", "country": "[[Swiss cuisine|Switzerland]]", "main ingredient": "[[Veal]] or [[Chicken (food)|chicken]] breast, [[cheese]], [[ham]], [[bread crumbs]]"}, "wikidata": {"Commons category (P373)": "Cordon bleu", "Freebase ID (P646)": "/m/0gj9rzv", "has part or parts (P527)": ["veal (Q957434)", "cheese (Q10943)"], "image (P18)": "Cordon-bleu-2.jpg", "country of origin (P495)": "Switzerland (Q39)", "subclass of (P279)": "veal dish (Q28100665)", "TasteAtlas ID (P5456)": "cordon-bleu", "part of (P361)": "Swiss cuisine (Q13497)", "Marmiton ID (P9769)": "cordon-bleu"}, "cat": "Foods", "url": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cordon_bleu_(dish)", "wikibase": "Q429518"}, {"name": "Fruit curd", "url_name": "3741471", "txt": "Fruit curd is a dessert spread and topping usually made with citrus fruit, such as lemon, lime, orange, grapefruit or tangerine. Other flavor variations include passion fruit, mango, and berries such as raspberries, cranberries or blackberries. The basic ingredients are beaten egg yolks, sugar, fruit juice, and zest, which are gently cooked together until thick and then allowed to cool, forming a soft, smooth, flavorful spread. The egg yolks are usually tempered in the cooking process to prevent their coagulation. Some recipes also include egg whites or butter.In late 19th- and early 20th-century England, homemade lemon curd was traditionally served with bread or scones at afternoon tea as an alternative to jam, and as a filling for cakes, small pastries, and tarts. Homemade lemon curd was usually made in relatively small amounts as it did not keep as well as jam. In more modern times, larger quantities became possible because of the use of refrigeration. Commercially manufactured curds often contain additional preservatives and thickening agents.Contemporary commercially made curds remain a popular spread for bread, scones, toast, waffles, crumpets, pancakes, cheesecake, or muffins. They can also be used as a flavoring for desserts or yoghurt. Lemon-meringue pie, made with lemon curd and topped with meringue, has been a popular dessert in Britain, Canada, Australia and the United States since the nineteenth century. Lemon curd can also have whipped cream folded into it for such uses as filling cream puffs.Curds differ from pie fillings or custards in that they contain a higher proportion of juice and zest, which gives them a bolder, fruitier taste. Also, curds containing butter have a smoother and creamier texture than both pie fillings and custards, which contain little or no butter and use cornstarch or flour for thickening. Additionally, unlike custards, curds are not usually eaten on their own.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nList of dessert sauces\nList of lemon dishes and drinks\nList of spreads\n\n\n== References ==", "infobox": {"name": "Fruit curd", "image": "Lemoncurd.jpg", "caption": "Homemade lemon curd", "country": "England", "course": "[[Dessert]]", "type": "[[Spread (food)|Spread]]", "main_ingredient": "Egg [[yolk]]s, [[sugar]], fruit juice and [[Zest (ingredient)|zest]] ([[lemon]]s, [[Lime (fruit)|limes]], [[Orange (fruit)|oranges]], or [[raspberry|raspberries]])"}, "wikidata": {"Freebase ID (P646)": "/m/09yh8g", "subclass of (P279)": ["spread (Q1472481)", "dessert sauce (Q25327021)", "fruit preserves (Q74048276)"], "image (P18)": "Lemoncurd.jpg", "has part or parts (P527)": ["egg yolk (Q181409)", "sugar (Q11002)"], "country of origin (P495)": "England (Q21)", "BabelNet ID (P2581)": "00050633n", "Commons category (P373)": "Fruit curds"}, "cat": "Foods", "url": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fruit_curd", "wikibase": "Q1799855"}, {"name": "Zarangollo", "url_name": "3730506", "txt": "Zarangollo is a common dish in the Murcian countryside in Spain.

Originally designed as an enclosed two-door coupe, and subsequently rendered also as a two-door convertible,  the GT100 (variously called the Nobe or Nobe 100) debuted at the 2019 Geneva Auto Show as the Nobe 01.Marketed by Nobe USA, Inc., the company had worked with Sandy Munro and Munro & Associates to engineer the vehicle for production  \u2014 which has not as of 2021 entered production. Designed in Estonia by company founder Roman Muljar in 2017, the Nobe's projected specifications include a weight of 1,100 lbs. and uses rechargeable, portable 120v/240v batteries \u2014 for a projected driving range of 180 miles and projected top speed of 80 miles per hour. Manufacture is projected ultimately for Tallinn, Estonia.The concept accommodates seating for two with a rear luggage area (or optional rear jump seat); front trunk; stability control; air-conditioning; fully integrated espresso machine and prominent wrap-around rear LED lights.  Other features in series production may include seat-belts with integral airbags and a system marketed as Gekko, facilitated by the car's light weight, that would allow the car to be cable-winched up aluminum rails mounted to the side of a building, enabling \"zero-footprint\" parking.The Nobe's styling, which integrates \"a late \u201850 to early \u201860s-era European automotive design vocabulary,\" has been received positively.  Writing for Jalopnik, automotive journalist Jamie Kitman called it \"retro yet modern, bizarre yet somehow familiar, adorable, even.\" Another reviewer described the styling as \"cute as hell. Like, Audrey Hepburn in white gloves cute. It's the car Edna Mode would drive.\" Still another said it is \"classically beautiful in its treatment of lines and motion - the Nobe looks downright breathtaking.\"The three-wheeler is marketed as off-road capable and would be classified in the United States as an autocycle, a regulatory class of three-wheeled vehicles requiring only a regular driver's license and exempt from federal automotive safety provisions when equipped with a steering wheel rather than handlebars, two side by side seats and seat belts (but not airbags). As of 2020, the classification existed in 48 states.The Nobe was featured in crowdsourcing campaigns both on Indiegogo and FundedByMe. Nobe USA, Inc. markets the company via their website, www.nobecars.com.\nControversy surfaced regarding the automaker when an investigative report on the Estonian news program Pealtn\u00e4gija on the ERR network investigated and found criminal charges and past bankruptcies associated with the CEO, Roman Muljar in addition to complaints by shareholders about his ability to run a business.

AutoTrack was the world's first swept path analysis software program, originally being jointly developed by TRL (the UK's Transport Research Laboratory) and British engineering consultants, Travers Morgan (acquired by Symonds in 1995 who are now part of Capita Symonds, in the form of TRACK. The term track refers to the tracking of a vehicle's simulated movements in relation to geometry, based upon vehicle dimensions, chassis and steering specification. AutoTrack has many similarities and performs the same function as the alternative swept path analysis program AutoTURN, which is developed by Transoft Solutions, Inc..\nAutoTrack is generally used by transportation engineers, architects and planners for the analysis and design of highways, intersections, buildings and other facilities to check that provision has been made for the space and geometry required to manoeuvre specified design vehicles. A design vehicle may be a real vehicle modelled within the software's computer environment but will often be a virtual vehicle that does not exist in real life, rather being indicative of the type and configuration of vehicle that the final design is expected to accommodate. Design vehicles are commonly specified by the relevant governing body that also controls the specification for which the design must conform.\nThe AutoTrack range is divided into modules that service the Road, Rail and Airports industries and operates within several different CAD systems such as AutoCAD by Autodesk, Microstation by Bentley Systems, Bricscad by Bricsys (a former member of the IntelliCAD Technology Consortium) and standalone in Microsoft Windows. When the software was first developed it initially ran as a DOS-based application and when it was ported to operate within AutoCAD, it was given the name AutoTrack. The software, initially developed for consulting purposes, was sold commercially and following the demise of the original company, a management buy out pre-empted the incorporation of Savoy Computing Services Ltd. in 1996. Two of the surviving directors of Savoy Computing were involved with the original development of TRACK.\nIn August, 2013 Autodesk acquired the technology assets of Savoy Computing Services Ltd, including the AutoTrack technology. Autodesk subsequently released Autodesk Vehicle Tracking, which directly superseded AutoTrack in November, 2013. At this point Savoy Computing Services ceased trading and the AutoTrack software product is since no longer supported.\n\n\n== Brief history of AutoTrack ==\n1988 \u2013 AutoTrack introduced \"lock to lock\" time as a critical factor used in the calculation of manoeuvrability of steered vehicles\n1991 \u2013 AutoTrack archived all design data within the \"parent\" CAD drawing\n1992 \u2013 AutoTrack introduced modelling of tram and light rail vehicle movements\n1997 \u2013 First swept path program to calculate effective axle positions from vehicle dimensions\n1999 \u2013 AutoTrack introduced AutoDrive (a mouse point and click system that calculates possible movements from one vehicle position to the next)\n1999 \u2013 Grip editing was introduced to enable the editing of vehicle paths instead of their deletion\n2002 \u2013 Recording of scaled animations containing multiple vehicles was introduced, with a movie file being able to be recorded from within the program\n2004 \u2013 A standalone version that operated in Microsoft Windows was introduced for engineers without CAD systems\n2007 \u2013 AutoTrack became the first 64-bit swept path analysis software program\n2013 \u2013 AutoTrack acquired by Autodesk\n\n\n== See also ==\nswept path analysis\nAutoTURN\nTurning Radius\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nAutodesk acquires the AutoTrack technology\nThe Freight Trade Association\n[6]\nThe American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials\nThe Design Manual for Roads and Bridges (DMRB)\nThe Transportation Research Board", "infobox": {"name": "AutoTrack", "developer": "Savoy Computing", "operating_system": "[[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] (XP / Vista / 7 / 8)", "genre": "Transportation Planning and Design", "license": "[[Software license agreement]]", "website": "www.savoycomputing.com [http://www.savoycomputing.com]"}, "wikidata": {"instance of (P31)": "software (Q7397)", "official website (P856)": "http://www.savoycomputing.com", "copyright license (P275)": "end-user license agreement (Q725920)", "Freebase ID (P646)": "/m/0rf7j6v"}, "cat": "Transport", "url": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AutoTrack", "wikibase": "Q16245933"}, {"name": "Bedford TJ", "url_name": "7002012", "txt": "The Bedford TJ is a truck that was produced by Bedford and their successors from 1958 to 1998, as a replacement for the earlier Bedford A series of medium-duty trucks that were produced between 1953 and 1958. The truck was the last bonneted truck produced by the company, and the last vehicle to be produced to have a relation with Bedford Vehicles.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Bedford TJ started getting produced in 1958 as the company's new bonneted truck model, and was a modernised version of the Bedford TD series, modeled after the Advanced Design US truck. The TJ truck was produced in many versions, including light pickups to heavy-duty vehicles, with payloads up to 6-8 tons. Unfortunately, due to their relatively dated styling, and presumably since bonneted trucks were falling out of favor these years, the TJ series was not very popular in the UK, and did not sold in big numbers, with the exception of the AA and Post Office Telephones, Holland's Pies in Lancashire used a large fleet of TJ vans well into the 1980s, notable for being kept in very clean condition, and the TJ was often called a 'Holland's pie van' around Lancashire.The lightest versions (J0) shared the same petrol engine as the Vauxhall Cresta, which offered relatively good performance, although it could not cope very well with loads over 800-900 kg. Heavier variants used the same engine as on the Bedford TD series. In export markets, specifically in countries such as India, Pakistan, and other developing countries, the TJ sold in great numbers, due to its reliability and relatively low price, compared to the competition. In 1975, the TJ was withdrawn from the UK market, and marked Bedford's last vehicle into the segment. The J0 and J1 pickup trucks and vans were replaced by the Bedford CF vans, but the heavy-duty versions (J2 and up) were left without a successor.After 1975, the TJ was offered only for export, where it was pretty successful, however, during the 1980s, exports to countries such as Australia and New Zealand stopped, since it was clear that these trucks were very outdated, and couldn't compete in the market anymore, nevertheless, it continued production for export to developing countries. After 1986, the Dunstable plant was sold to David J.B. Brown and became AWD Trucks.  Production of the TJ continiued under the AWD Bedford badge. After Marshall SPV purchased AWD Trucks, they continiued producing the TJ series, but in limited numbers. The last TJ trucks were built in 1998, when an order was placed for 100 trucks to be exported to Kenya.\n\n\n=== Pakistan ===\nIn Pakistan, the J5/6 is very popular and dominated commercial vehicular traffic. It has a cult status among drivers and is known for its power, reliability, and durability. Over 50% of the trucks in Pakistan are Bedford vehicles.\n\n\n=== India ===\nAn Indian company, Hindustan Motors, also produced the larger versions (J5/6) of the vehicle in that country from 1968, production lasted until 1995 when the vehicle proved to be unable to compete with Tata and Ashok Leyland vehicles.\n\n\n=== Australia ===\nThe TJ was widely exported. In Australia they were distributed by GM-Holden.\n\n\n=== Malaysia ===\nBedford TJ trucks were also produced in Malaysia from knock-down kits, until the late 1970s, when Bedford vehicles generally fell out of favor there, and GM focused more on promoting Isuzu on that market. There, the TJ trucks were replaced by the Isuzu TX trucks.\n\n\n== Models ==\nJ0 (often referred to as JO)\nJ1\nJ2\nJ3\nJ4\nJ5\nJ6\n\n\n== Chassis codes ==\n\n\n=== 1958 To June 1967 ===\nJ1 30cwt.\nJ2S 3ton.\nJ2L 3ton.

The UV tramcars have four main variants, all are four axle rail motor coaches with a Bo'Bo'tr axle arrangement, capable of operating as electric multiple units. The cars were manufactured between 1956 and 1965 in Budapest, and overall 375 regular units and 2 prototypes were made.\nThe UV type designation resolves to U t\u00edpus\u00fa t\u00e1vvez\u00e9relt motorkocsi (\"type U remotely controlled motor coach\"). The units are capable of controlling another unit of their type through proprietary 50-wire cables. The trams are also capable of sensing the breakup of the tramset with the use of a chain hanging between the cars; brakes are automatically applied if a chain is pulled out from its sockets. Two prototypes were made with aluminium carbodies, designated as UZ, these proved to be unsuccessful. In addition, in the 1990s, 20 UV cars were refurbished and they are referred to as MUV (moderniz\u00e1lt UV, \"modernized UV\"). Planned to replace the pre-WWII design TM trams, with 377 units, the UV series became the most numerous type of tramcar produced in Hungary.\nThe first car entered passenger service in 1956, and the type was ultimately decommissioned in 2007, after roughly 51 years of continuous service. UV trams became one of the symbols of Budapest, and had appeared in a number of Hungarian and foreign movies as plot elements. Two preserved, paired UV cars now annually serve as the city's so-called Christmas light trams in the festive season, decorated with white and blue LED lights.\n\n\n== Design and manufacturing ==\nThe UV series was designed with the aid of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences, and was specifically intended to improve on and address the flaws of the then-current TM Stuka tramcars which debuted in 1939. In 1948, Ganz showcased a prototype tram set on the Budapest International Fair (BNV), made up from three modified TM cars damaged in the war. The modified TMs at the ends were referred to as TV, resolving to T t\u00edpus\u00fa t\u00e1vvez\u00e9relt motorkocsi (\"type T remotely controlled motor coach\"), the most significant alteration being that they were capable of operating as multiple units with each other with or without the third TM car acting as a plain trailer car in between. This prototype tram was nicknamed Szellem (\"Ghost\"). While the TV didn't reached mass production, it served as a basis for the UV design.\nEventually four main variants of UV tramcars were produced, with the UV4 variant reaching only the planning stage. These variants are shown in the following table.\n\nThere were no designs for a new trailer car for the UV series, and in practice, Budapest's tram operator (FVV, and its successor, BKV) used earlier EP and FP trailers. These were modified to support the UV control and power connections and to fit the UV aesthetics more closely.\nA prototype design was also manufactured with the designation UZ, with a lighter carbody made from aluminium. Only two tramcars were made in 1958 and 1959 since the design proved to be expensive to produce and fragile. The two cars however saw a few years of passenger service. Another prototype was made in 1962 from a pair of UV1 and UV2 tramcars damaged in a collision, these were joined to form an articulated vehicle (referred to as the iker-UV, \"twin UV\"), but the results were deemed unsuccessful, and the cars were separated and rebuilt as regular single cars.\nBetween 1993 and 1994, 20 of the UV3 tramcars were refurbished, and were designated as MUV (moderniz\u00e1lt UV, \"modernized UV\"). A significant change were the elimination of the power couplings between cars, as a consequence, car sets having MUV cars had to operate with all their pantographs in an active position.\nUV-related prototypes, refurbishments and other related vehicles are shown in the following table.\n\n\n== See also ==\nGanz TM\nFVV CSM\nGanz CSMG\nTrams in Budapest\nGanz Works\nR\u00e1ba (company)\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==", "infobox": {"background": "#F5C71A", "name": "Ganz UV", "image": "Lijn47UVwagn.jpg", "caption": "An UV tramset on Budapest's line 47 in 1992", "service": "1956\u20132007<br />(~51 years)", "manufacturer": "''underframe and bogies:''<br />[[Ganz Works|Ganz Vagon- \u00e9s G\u00e9pgy\u00e1r]]<br />[[Budapest]],&nbsp; {{flag|Hungary}} <br />''carbody:''<br />[[R\u00e1ba (company)|R\u00e1ba Magyar Vagon- \u00e9s G\u00e9pgy\u00e1r]],<br />[[Gy\u0151r]],&nbsp; {{flag|Hungary}} <br />''traction system:''<br />[[Ganz Works|Klement Gottwald Villamoss\u00e1gi Gy\u00e1r]]<br />[[Budapest]],&nbsp; {{flag|Hungary}}", "replaced": "[[Ganz TM]] ''Stuka''", "yearconstruction": "''UV1:'' 1956\u20131957<br />''UV2:'' 1958\u20131959<br />''UV3:'' 1959\u20131961<br />''UV5:'' 1962\u20131965<br />''UZ:'' 1958\u20131959", "yearservice": "1956<br />( {{Years or months ago|1956}} )", "refurbishment": "1993\u20131994<br />''(20 UV into MUV)''", "yearscrapped": "1990s\u20132007<br />( {{Years or months ago|2007}} )", "numberbuilt": "''UV1:'' 50<br />''UV2:'' 100<br />''UV3:'' 125<br />''UV4:'' 0<br />''UV5:'' 100<br />''UZ:'' 2<br />''total:'' 377", "numberservice": "0", "numberpreserved": "at least 11 cars<br />(multiple variants)", "numberscrapped": "n.a.", "formation": "MC, {{efn|name|=|MC|MC stands for [[Motor coach (rail)|motor coach]]}} MC+TR, {{efn|name|=|TR|TR stands for [[Trailer (vehicle)|trailer car]]}} MC+TR+MC, MC+MC", "fleetnumbers": "''UV1:'' 3200\u20133249<br />''UV2:'' 3250\u20133349<br />''UV3:'' 3350\u20133474<br />''UV5:'' 3800\u20133899", "capacity": "94 passengers {{efn|name|=|5ppm|assuming 5 passengers/m\u00b2}}", "operator": "F\u0151v\u00e1rosi Villamosvas\u00fat (FVV),<br />Budapest,&nbsp; {{flag|Hungary}} <br />''(1956\u20131967)''<br />[[BKV Zrt.|Budapesti K\u00f6zleked\u00e9si V\u00e1llalat]] (BKV),<br />Budapest,&nbsp; {{flag|Hungary}} <br />''(1968\u20132007)''", "carbody": "''UV1, UV2, UV3, UV5:''<br />steel,<br />''UZ:''<br />aluminium", "carlength": "''carbody:''<br /> {{convert|12600|mm|ftin|abbr|=|on}} <br />''between couplers:''<br /> {{convert|13500|mm|ftin|abbr|=|on}} <br />''(UV1, UV2, UV3)''<br /> {{convert|13690|mm|ftin|abbr|=|on}} <br />''(UV5)''", "width": "{{convert|2300|mm|ftin|abbr|=|on}}", "height": "{{convert|3100|mm|ftin|abbr|=|on}}", "floorheight": "{{convert|783|mm|ftin|abbr|=|on}} <br />''(midsection)''<br /> {{convert|668|mm|ftin|abbr|=|on}} <br />''(end sections)''", "entrylevelorstep": "step", "wheeldiameter": "{{convert|670|mm|ftin|abbr|=|on}}", "doors": "telescopic sliding doors,<br />3 per side<br />''UV1, UV2, UV3:''<br />2+1+2<br />''UV5:''<br />2+2+2", "maxspeed": "{{convert|50|kph|mph|abbr|=|on}}", "weight": "{{convert|19750|kg|ST|abbr|=|on}}", "traction": "4&nbsp;\u00d7 [[Ganz Works|Ganz]]&nbsp;TA&nbsp;1.18<br />''initially in early cars:''<br />4&nbsp;\u00d7 Ganz&nbsp;TA&nbsp;1.12", "poweroutput": "4&nbsp;\u00d7 {{convert|50|hp-electrical|kW|abbr|=|on}} <br />(= {{convert|200|hp-electrical|kW|abbr|=|on}} )<br />''initially in early cars:''<br />4&nbsp;\u00d7 {{convert|42|hp-electrical|kW|abbr|=|on}} <br />(= {{convert|168|hp-electrical|kW|abbr|=|on}} )", "aux": "24&nbsp;V&nbsp;DC", "powersupply": "600&nbsp;V&nbsp;DC<br />''(except MUV cars)''", "hvac": "electric heating", "electricsystem": "600&nbsp;V&nbsp;DC from [[overhead line]]", "collectionmethod": "[[Pantograph (transport)|pantograph]]", "uicclass": "Bo'Bo'tr {{efn|name|=|UICtr|the UIC axle arrangement classification appendix \"tr\" officially denotes a tram vehicle}}", "bogies": "pivoting", "brakes": "electric, electro-pneumatic", "safety": "proprietary tramset breakage sensing system", "coupling": "''mechanical:''<br />[[Alemann coupler|Alemann-type]] [[Cone coupler|trichterkupplung]]<br />''electrical:''<br />proprietary DC connectors", "multipleworking": "only with same type", "light": "[[incandescent light bulb]]s", "gauge": "{{track gauge|sg}}"}, "wikidata": {"image (P18)": "UV villamos (3888).jpg", "instance of (P31)": "tram model (Q76154857)", "manufacturer (P176)": "Ganz Works (Q369524)", "Commons category (P373)": "UV trams", "has use (P366)": "public transport (Q178512)", "operator (P137)": "Budapesti K\u00f6zleked\u00e9si Zrt.

The CSMG tramcars have three main variants, which are all eight axle rail motor coaches with a Bo'2'2'Bo'tr axle arrangement, the last variant being capable of operating as electric multiple units. The cars were manufactured in Budapest between 1964 and 1978, and in overall 152 regular units and two prototypes were made.\nThe official CSMG designation resolves to Csukl\u00f3s Motorkocsi, Ganz (\"Articulated Motor Coach, Ganz\"), this was changed to GCSM in FVV and BKV records, and the semi-official ICS resolves to Ipari Csukl\u00f3s (\"Industrial Articulated\"), because it was the first articulated tram design in Hungary which was produced by a regular manufacturing company instead of an in-house workshop of a transit company. The final production variant of the series is capable of controlling another unit of its type through proprietary 50-wire cables, though traction current isn't shared between units. The trams are also capable of sensing the breakup of the tramset with a proprietary system implemented along the couplers. Two prototypes, sometimes referred to as CSMG-0, were made before mass production started, these cars originally had a single articulated joint instead of two, but later these were extended. The production variants CSMG-1, CSMG-2 and CSMG-3 were unified over the years and now they are referred to as CSMG-E. One damaged car was rebuilt with experimental features, and its type is referred to as KCSV-5. Partly based on the operating experiences of this car, in the 1990s 20 CSMG cars were refurbished, their type is referred to as KCSV-7. The CSMG was intended to replace the lower capacity Ganz UV and obsolete, in-house FVV CSM Beng\u00e1li trams.\nCSMG tramcars are still in active service in Budapest, whereas \u2013 with the exception of the two prototypes \u2013 the first scrapping took place only in 2009, when the only KCSV-5 car was taken out of service owing to maintenance difficulties. The first tramcar entered passenger service in 1965, thus the series is now in continuous service for 56\u201357 years. The series also carries the distinction of having one of the cars take Diana, Princess of Wales on a ride along the city's scenic Line 2 on the Danube's bank. CSMG tramcars are nicknamed as ICS or ipari csukl\u00f3s (\"industrial articulated\"), Ganz csukl\u00f3s (\"Ganz articulated\"), or when running in multiple unit pairs, G\u00f3li\u00e1t (\"Goliath\").\n\n\n== Design and manufacturing ==\nThe CSMG series was Ganz's, and thus the Hungarian machine industry's first foray into articulated rail vehicle production as the obsolete CSM Beng\u00e1li tramcars made by FVV's in-house \u00c1rp\u00e1d F\u00fczesi Workshop, and Ganz's own lower capacity UV series proved to be inadequate for the growing demands of Budapest's tram network. Thus two CSMG prototypes, sometimes referred to as CSMG-0, were manufactured between 1964 and 1965. These had only one articulation, but were expanded with another body section later to resemble the production variants, as they were in passenger service for some years.

The CSMG tramcars have three main variants, which are all eight axle rail motor coaches with a Bo'2'2'Bo'tr axle arrangement, the last variant being capable of operating as electric multiple units. The cars were manufactured in Budapest between 1964 and 1978, and in overall 152 regular units and two prototypes were made.\nThe official CSMG designation resolves to Csukl\u00f3s Motorkocsi, Ganz (\"Articulated Motor Coach, Ganz\"), this was changed to GCSM in FVV and BKV records, and the semi-official ICS resolves to Ipari Csukl\u00f3s (\"Industrial Articulated\"), because it was the first articulated tram design in Hungary which was produced by a regular manufacturing company instead of an in-house workshop of a transit company. The final production variant of the series is capable of controlling another unit of its type through proprietary 50-wire cables, though traction current isn't shared between units. The trams are also capable of sensing the breakup of the tramset with a proprietary system implemented along the couplers. Two prototypes, sometimes referred to as CSMG-0, were made before mass production started, these cars originally had a single articulated joint instead of two, but later these were extended. The production variants CSMG-1, CSMG-2 and CSMG-3 were unified over the years and now they are referred to as CSMG-E. One damaged car was rebuilt with experimental features, and its type is referred to as KCSV-5. Partly based on the operating experiences of this car, in the 1990s 20 CSMG cars were refurbished, their type is referred to as KCSV-7. The CSMG was intended to replace the lower capacity Ganz UV and obsolete, in-house FVV CSM Beng\u00e1li trams.\nCSMG tramcars are still in active service in Budapest, whereas \u2013 with the exception of the two prototypes \u2013 the first scrapping took place only in 2009, when the only KCSV-5 car was taken out of service owing to maintenance difficulties. The first tramcar entered passenger service in 1965, thus the series is now in continuous service for 56\u201357 years. The series also carries the distinction of having one of the cars take Diana, Princess of Wales on a ride along the city's scenic Line 2 on the Danube's bank. CSMG tramcars are nicknamed as ICS or ipari csukl\u00f3s (\"industrial articulated\"), Ganz csukl\u00f3s (\"Ganz articulated\"), or when running in multiple unit pairs, G\u00f3li\u00e1t (\"Goliath\").\n\n\n== Design and manufacturing ==\nThe CSMG series was Ganz's, and thus the Hungarian machine industry's first foray into articulated rail vehicle production as the obsolete CSM Beng\u00e1li tramcars made by FVV's in-house \u00c1rp\u00e1d F\u00fczesi Workshop, and Ganz's own lower capacity UV series proved to be inadequate for the growing demands of Budapest's tram network. Thus two CSMG prototypes, sometimes referred to as CSMG-0, were manufactured between 1964 and 1965. These had only one articulation, but were expanded with another body section later to resemble the production variants, as they were in passenger service for some years. After the first CSMG production run however, features were scaled back, this resulted in tramcars having less comfort, but after years of repairs and refurbishments, almost all CSMG cars converged to a general set of specifications referred to as CSMG-E (Csukl\u00f3s Motorkocsi, Ganz \u2013 Egys\u00e9ges\u00edtett, \"Articulated Motor Coach, Ganz \u2013 Unified\").\nEventually 3 main variants of CSMG tramcars were produced, these variants are shown in the following table.\n\nBetween 1991 and 1994, a CSMG car damaged in the 1980s was rebuilt and modernized by Ganz and got the designation KCSV-5 (Korszer\u0171s\u00edtett Csukl\u00f3s Villamos, 5-\u00f6s t\u00edpus, \"Modernized Articulated Tram, type 5\").

She was designed by Colin Mudie, and is his design no 342. The ship was launched almost a year after the formal keel laying.After J W Cook went into voluntary liquidation, Lord Nelson was moved to Vosper Thornycroft\u2019s yard in Woolston, Southampton. As a result of an industrial dispute at Vospers, Lord Nelson had to move again, this time to Coles Yard in Cowes where the remainder of the work was carried out. She was finally sailed in completed form from Southampton on 17 October 1986.She finished her final voyage on 10 October 2019 to Southampton, and was subsequently moved to Bristol docks for decommissioning.\n\n\n=== History in service ===\nSTS Lord Nelson completed 16,000 accessible voyages during her 33 years at sea with the Jubilee Sailing Trust\n\n\n== Further reading ==\n\"LORD NELSON - Sail On Board\".

It is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade I listed building. The shrine dates from the early 2nd century and is carved into the face of a sandstone quarry. It is the only monument of its kind in Western Europe that remains in its original location. It is protected by a 19th-century stone surround with a hood, which was refurbished in the late 20th century. The carving has weathered over the centuries and has also been damaged by human activity. Next to the shrine is an opening into the rock face which is possibly a natural fissure that has been enlarged and which is known as Edgar's Cave.The shrine stands beside the route of the old main Roman road into the fortress of Deva from the south. Minerva was the Roman goddess of war, knowledge, and craftsmanship. She is often depicted with her attributes of helmet, shield, breastplate, and spear, but in this instance she is shown in a simplified form, standing in a representation of a temple.  The Roman quarry, together with Edgar's Field and the image of Minerva, is a Scheduled Monument.A cast of the shrine is kept in the Grosvenor Museum, in Chester.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nList of Scheduled Monuments in Cheshire dated to before 1066\nGrade I listed buildings in Cheshire West and Chester\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Minerva's Shrine, Chester at Wikimedia Commons\n\nIllustrated article on Minerva's Shrine'\nThe Minerva Shrine", "infobox": {"name": "Minerva's Shrine", "image": "Minerva's Shrine.jpg", "image_size": "250", "caption": "Minerva's Shrine", "locmapin": "Cheshire", "map_width": "250", "map_caption": "Location in Cheshire", "coordinates": "{{coord|53.1843|-2.8893|display|=|inline,title}}", "location": "Edgar's Field, [[Handbridge]], [[Chester]], England", "gbgridref": "SJ 406 656", "built": "2nd century", "designation1": "Grade I", "designation1_date": "28 July 1955", "designation1_number": "1375783"}, "wikidata": {"coordinate location (P625)": {"latitude": 53.1843, "longitude": -2.8893, "altitude": null, "precision": 0.0001, "globe": "http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q2"}, "country (P17)": "United Kingdom (Q145)", "National Heritage List for England number (P1216)": ["1375783", "1014718"], "image (P18)": "Minerva's Shrine.jpg", "heritage designation (P1435)": ["Grade I listed building (Q15700818)", "scheduled monument (Q219538)"], "Digital Atlas of the Roman Empire ID (P1936)": "44349", "Commons category (P373)": "Minerva's Shrine, Chester", "instance of (P31)": "shrine (Q697295)", "located in the administrative territorial entity (P131)": "Cheshire West and Chester (Q1070591)", "Atlas Obscura identifier (P7772)": "minervas-shrine", "historic county (P7959)": "Cheshire (Q67287495)", "OS grid reference (P613)": "SJ4066765613", "Freebase ID (P646)": "/m/02wzctb"}, "cat": "Monuments_and_memorials", "url": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minerva's_Shrine,_Chester", "wikibase": "Q6864464"}, {"name": "Memorial Park Bubanj", "url_name": "27965936", "txt": "Memorial Park Bubanj (Serbian: \u041c\u0435\u043c\u043e\u0440\u0438j\u0430\u043b\u043d\u0438 \u043f\u0430\u0440\u043a \u0411\u0443\u0431\u0430\u045a, \u0421\u043f\u043e\u043c\u0435\u043d \u043f\u0430\u0440\u043a \u0411\u0443\u0431\u0430\u045a, Memorijalni park Bubanj, Spomen park Bubanj) is a World War II memorial complex built to commemorate the shooting and execution of more than 10,000 citizens of Ni\u0161 and people from Serbia and other parts of the country, but according to some data, over 12,000 people, and it is located in Palilula municipality of Ni\u0161, Serbia.\n\n\n== Location ==\nSituated on the hill southwest of the Bubanj of Ni\u0161, which cut the main road Ni\u0161 - Skopje, is situated 2 km from the other Serbian Cultural Property of Great Importance, Crveni Krst concentration camp.\n\n\n== Memorial complex ==\n\nThe complex is arranged as a park, with a memorial trail about half a mile long running through it. The centrepiece of the site is a marble relief measuring 23 by 2.5 metres, with five compositions that symbolize the \"killing machine\": execution and firing squads, civil revolts, surrender of the German invaders and final victory over the oppressors.\nAnother dominant feature of the park is three concrete obelisks that symbolize raised hands with clenched fists. Each of the three fists are different sizes, depicting men's, women's and children's hands that defy the enemy, symbolic of the fact entire families were killed at Bubanj.\nNearby there is a summer stage.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== World War II ===\nGerman execution squads established sites in Bubanj forest to which Serbs, Gypsies and Jews were brought by trucks. Mass exterminations were carried out from February 1942 to September 1944, including about 10,000 inmates and detainees killed by the Special Police and local penal authorities. The entire area is intersected by trenches in which the shooting victims were buried. Before the withdrawal of the Germans as the Red Army advanced into Yugoslavia in 1944, captured Italians were ordered to dig up the trenches and burn the corpses of the victims in order to destroy all traces of the atrocities committed there.\n\n\n=== Federal Republic of Yugoslavia ===\nIn 1950, the execution site was originally marked by a memorial pyramid. A new monument, \"Three fists\", was commissioned by Yugoslav sculptor Ivan Saboli\u0107 and was unveiled on 14 October 1963.\nBubanj Memorial Park was declared a Historic Landmark of Exceptional Importance in 1979, and it is protected by the Republic of Serbia.\n\n\n=== Recent history ===\nIn 2004, a chapel built of glass and metal was added to the complex. It was designed by the architect Alexander Bu\u0111evac. The entire memorial hill was redeveloped in 2009.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nTourism in Serbia\nHistoric Landmarks of Exceptional Importance\nList of Yugoslav World War II monuments and memorials in Serbia\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nCultural Monuments in Serbia\nPalilula and Culture: Historical monuments ((en))\nBubanj at www.nistourism.org.rs (in Serbian)\n\u0421\u041f\u041e\u041c\u0415\u041d \u041f\u0410\u0420\u041a \u201e\u0411\u0423\u0411\u0410\u040a\u201c \u041d\u0410 \u041c\u0415\u0422\u0418 \u0412\u0410\u041d\u0414\u0410\u041b\u0410 (in Serbian)\nSpomenik Database - Bubanj Memorial at Ni\u0161 historical and informational resource (English)", "infobox": {"name": "Memorial Park Bubanj", "image": "File:Spomen park Bubanj.JPG", "caption": "Three fists monument", "type": "Memorial park", "coordinates": "{{coord|43|18|18|N|21|52|21|E|source:srwiki_region:RS|display|=|title}}", "location": "[[Palilula, Ni\u0161|Palilula]], [[Ni\u0161]], [[Serbia]]", "built": "1963", "designation1": "Serbia", "designation1_type": "[[Historic Landmarks of Exceptional Importance (Serbia)|Historic Landmark of Exceptional Importance]]", "designation1_date": "1973", "designation1_number": "[http://spomenicikulture.mi.sanu.ac.rs/spomenik.php?id=603 \u0417\u041c 7]"}, "wikidata": {"Commons category (P373)": "Bubanj Memorial Park", "located in the administrative territorial entity (P131)": "Bubanj (Q2732638)", "coordinate location (P625)": {"latitude": 43.305, "longitude": 21.8725, "altitude": null, "precision": 0.00027777777777778, "globe": "http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q2"}, "image (P18)": "Spomen park Bubanj.JPG", "instance of (P31)": "war memorial (Q575759)", "start time (P580)": "+1950-01-01T00:00:00Z", "country (P17)": "Serbia (Q403)", "postal code (P281)": "18000", "Freebase ID (P646)": "/m/0ch4rjw", "main subject (P921)": "Taylor County Airport (Q7689919)"}, "cat": "Monuments_and_memorials", "url": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubanj_Memorial_Park", "wikibase": "Q1250054"}, {"name": "Wainwright Tomb", "url_name": "30527606", "txt": "The Wainwright Tomb is a mausoleum located in Bellefontaine Cemetery in St. Louis, Missouri. Originally constructed for Charlotte Dickson Wainwright in 1892, the tomb also contains the remains of her husband, Ellis Wainwright. The mausoleum was designed by noted Chicago school architect Louis Sullivan, who also designed the Wainwright Building for Ellis Wainwright.\n\n\n== History ==\nShortly after the construction of the Wainwright Building in Downtown St. Louis (itself now a National Historic Landmark), the \"young and beautiful\" wife of wealthy St. Louis brewery owner Ellis Wainwright died. Wainwright commissioned Louis Sullivan to design a tomb for his wife and himself, which was completed in 1892. In 1901, Wainwright fled the United States after being indicted for bribery, but he later returned and died in St. Louis in 1924, then was entombed with his wife. After his death, an endowment was established that provided for the reconstruction or renovation of the tomb in case of earthquake or vandalism. The tomb was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on June 15, 1970 and became a St. Louis Landmark in 1971.\n\n\n== Architecture and significance ==\nThe tomb is a domed cubic building with walls of concrete covered in limestone on the exterior. On the northeast (front) side of the tomb is the entrance with a double-leafed bronze grill and double-doors. The sides of the tomb each have windows, also covered in bronze grills. The limestone walls are carved with floral patterns that do not repeat. The interior of the tomb has two burial slabs and a mosaic floor and ceiling. The Wainwright Tomb has significance as a work of Louis Sullivan, and it has been described as \"the most sensitive and the most graceful of Sullivan's tombs\" and as \"one of Sullivan's masterpieces.\"\n\n\n== See also ==\nGetty Tomb\nRyerson Tomb\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\"National Register of Historic Places Registration Form\" (PDF).

Sculptor Gutzon Borglum created the sculpture's design and oversaw the project's execution from 1927 to 1941 with the help of his son, Lincoln Borglum. The sculpture features the 60-foot (18 m) heads of Presidents George Washington (1732\u20131799), Thomas Jefferson (1743\u20131826), Theodore Roosevelt (1858\u20131919) and Abraham Lincoln (1809\u20131865), as recommended by Borglum. The four presidents were chosen to represent the nation's birth, growth, development and preservation, respectively. The memorial park covers 1,278 acres (2.00 sq mi; 5.17 km2) and the actual mountain has an elevation of 5,725 feet (1,745 m) above sea level.The sculptor and tribal representatives settled on Mount Rushmore, which also has the advantage of facing southeast for maximum sun exposure. Doane Robinson wanted it to feature American West heroes, such as Lewis and Clark, their expedition guide Sacagawea, Oglala Lakota chief Red Cloud, Buffalo Bill Cody, and Oglala Lakota chief Crazy Horse. Borglum believed that the sculpture should have broader appeal and chose the four presidents.\nPeter Norbeck, U.S. senator from South Dakota, sponsored the project and secured federal funding. Construction began in 1927; the presidents' faces were completed between 1934 and 1939. After Gutzon Borglum died in March 1941, his son Lincoln took over as leader of the construction project. Each president was originally to be depicted from head to waist, but lack of funding forced construction to end on October 31, 1941.Sometimes referred to as the \"Shrine of Democracy\", Mount Rushmore attracts more than two million visitors annually.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nMount Rushmore was conceived with the intention of creating a site to lure tourists, representing \"not only the wild grandeur of its local geography but also the triumph of western civilization over that geography through its anthropomorphic representation.\" Though for the latest occupants of the land at the time, the Lakota Sioux, as well as other tribes, the monument in their view \"came to epitomize the loss of their sacred lands and the injustices they've suffered under the U.S. government.\" Under the Treaty of 1868, the U.S. government promised the territory, including the entirety of the Black Hills, to the Sioux \"so long as the buffalo may range thereon in such numbers as to justify the chase.\" After the discovery of gold on the land, American settlers migrated to the area in the 1870s. The federal government then forced the Sioux to relinquish the Black Hills portion of their reservation.The four presidential faces were said to be carved into the granite with the intention of symbolizing \"an accomplishment born, planned, and created in the minds and by the hands of Americans for Americans\".\n\n\n=== Naming ===\nMount Rushmore was known to the Lakota Sioux as \"The Six Grandfathers\" (T\u021fu\u014bk\u00e1\u0161ila \u0160\u00e1kpe) or \"Cougar Mountain\" (Igm\u00fat\u021fa\u014bka Pah\u00e1); but American settlers knew it variously as Cougar Mountain, Sugarloaf Mountain, Slaughterhouse Mountain and Keystone Cliffs. As Six Grandfathers, the mountain was on the route that Lakota leader Black Elk took in a spiritual journey that culminated at Black Elk Peak. Following a series of military campaigns from 1876 to 1878, the United States asserted control over the area, a claim that is still disputed on the basis of the 1868 Treaty of Fort Laramie.Beginning with a prospecting expedition in 1885 with David Swanzey (husband of Carrie Ingalls), and Bill Challis, wealthy investor Charles E. Rushmore began visiting the area regularly on prospecting and hunting trips. He repeatedly joked with colleagues about naming the mountain after himself. The United States Board of Geographic Names officially recognized the name \"Mount Rushmore\" in June 1930.\n\n\n=== Concept, design and funding ===\nHistorian Doane Robinson conceived the idea for Mount Rushmore in 1923 to promote tourism in South Dakota. In 1924, Robinson persuaded sculptor Gutzon Borglum to travel to the Black Hills region to ensure the carving could be accomplished. The original plan was to make the carvings in granite pillars known as the Needles. However, Borglum realized that the eroded Needles were too thin to support sculpting. He chose Mount Rushmore, a grander location, partly because it faced southeast and enjoyed maximum exposure to the sun.Borglum said upon seeing Mount Rushmore, \"America will march along that skyline.\"Borglum had been involved in sculpting the Stone Mountain Memorial to Confederate leaders in Georgia, but was in disagreement with the officials there.After long negotiations involving a congressional delegation and President Calvin Coolidge, the project received congressional approval on March 3, 1925. The carving started in 1927 and ended in 1941 with no fatalities.\n\n\n=== Construction ===\nBetween October 4, 1927, and October 31, 1941, Gutzon Borglum and 400 workers sculpted the colossal 60-foot-high (18 m) carvings of United States Presidents George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Theodore Roosevelt, and Abraham Lincoln to represent the first 150 years of American history. These presidents were selected by Borglum because of their role in preserving the Republic and expanding its territory. The carving of Mount Rushmore involved the use of dynamite, followed by the process of \"honeycombing\", a process where workers drill holes close together, allowing small pieces to be removed by hand. In total, about 450,000 short tons (410,000 t) of rock were blasted off the mountainside. The image of Thomas Jefferson was originally intended to appear in the area at Washington's right, but after the work there was begun, the rock was found to be unsuitable, so the work on the Jefferson figure was dynamited, and a new figure was sculpted to Washington's left.\n\nThe chief carver of the mountain was Luigi Del Bianco, an artisan and stonemason in Port Chester, New York. Del Bianco emigrated to the U.S. from Friuli in Italy and was chosen to work on this project because of his understanding of sculptural language and ability to imbue emotion in the carved portraits.In 1933, the National Park Service took Mount Rushmore under its jurisdiction. Julian Spotts helped with the project by improving its infrastructure. For example, he had the tram upgraded so it could reach the top of Mount Rushmore for the ease of workers. By July 4, 1934, Washington's face had been completed and was dedicated. The face of Thomas Jefferson was dedicated in 1936, and the face of Abraham Lincoln was dedicated on September 17, 1937. In 1937, a bill was introduced in Congress to add the head of civil-rights leader Susan B. Anthony, but a rider was passed on an appropriations bill requiring federal funds be used to finish only those heads that had already been started at that time. In 1939, the face of Theodore Roosevelt was dedicated.The Sculptor's Studio \u2013 a display of unique plaster models and tools related to the sculpting \u2013 was built in 1939 under the direction of Borglum. Borglum died from an embolism in March 1941. His son, Lincoln Borglum, continued the project. Originally, it was planned that the figures would be carved from head to waist, but insufficient funding forced the carving to end.  Borglum had also planned a massive panel in the shape of the Louisiana Purchase commemorating in eight-foot-tall gilded letters the Declaration of Independence, U.S. Constitution, Louisiana Purchase, and seven other territorial acquisitions from the Alaska purchase to the Panama Canal Zone. In total, the entire project cost US$989,992.32 (equivalent to $18.2 million in 2021).Nick Clifford, the last remaining carver, died in November 2019 at age 98.\n\n\n=== Visitor center ===\nHarold Spitznagel and Cecil Doty designed the original visitor center, finished in 1957. These structures were part of the Mission 66 effort to improve visitors' facilities at national parks and monuments across the country.Ten years of redevelopment work culminated with the completion of extensive visitor facilities and sidewalks in 1998, such as a Visitor Center, the Lincoln Borglum Museum, and the Presidential Trail. Maintenance of the memorial requires mountain climbers to monitor and seal cracks annually. Due to budget constraints, the memorial is not regularly cleaned to remove lichens. However, on July 8, 2005, Alfred K\u00e4rcher, a German manufacturer of pressure washing and steam cleaning machines, conducted a free cleanup operation which lasted several weeks, using pressurized water at over 200 \u00b0F (93 \u00b0C).On October 15, 1966, Mount Rushmore was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. A 500-word essay giving the history of the United States by Nebraska student William Andrew Burkett was selected as the college-age group winner in a 1934 competition, and that essay was placed on the Entablature on a bronze plate in 1973. In 1991, President George H. W. Bush officially dedicated Mount Rushmore.\n\n\n=== Proposals of adding additional faces ===\nIn 1937, when the sculpture was not yet complete, a bill in Congress supporting the addition of women's rights activist Susan B. Anthony failed. When the sculpture was completed in 1941, the sculptors stated that the remaining rock was not suitable for additional carvings. This stance was shared by RESPEC, an engineering firm charged with monitoring the stability of the rock in 1989. However, proposals of additional sculptures have been made regardless. These include John F. Kennedy after his assassination in 1963, and Ronald Reagan in 1985 and 1999 \u2013 the latter proposal receiving a debate in Congress at the time. Barack Obama was asked about his own potential addition in 2008 and he joked that his ears were too large.According to a survey of political science experts conducted by The New York Times in 2018, Franklin D. Roosevelt is the most popular choice for addition to Mount Rushmore, regardless of party affiliation. In total, 66% of respondents would choose Roosevelt, followed by Barack Obama at 7% and Ronald Reagan at 5%. Among Democrats, Roosevelt was chosen by 75%, followed by Barack Obama at 11%. Among Republicans, Roosevelt was chosen by 43%, followed by Reagan at 19%. Among Independents, Roosevelt was chosen by 57%, followed by both Reagan and Dwight D. Eisenhower at 11%.\n\n\n== Tourism ==\nTourism is South Dakota's second-largest industry, and Mount Rushmore is the state's top tourist attraction. In 2012, 2,185,447 people visited the park.In the 1950s and 1960s, local Lakota Sioux elder Benjamin Black Elk (son of medicine man Black Elk, who had been present at the Battle of the Little Bighorn) was known as the \"Fifth Face of Mount Rushmore\", posing for photographs with thousands of tourists daily in his native attire. The South Dakota State Historical Society notes that he was one of the most photographed people in the world over that twenty-year period.\n\n\n== Hall of Records ==\n\nBorglum originally envisioned a grand Hall of Records where America's greatest historical documents and artifacts could be protected and shown to tourists. He managed to start the project, but cut only 70 feet (21 m) into the rock before work stopped in 1939 to focus on the faces. In 1998, an effort to complete Borglum's vision resulted in a repository being constructed inside the mouth of the cave housing 16 enamel panels that contained biographical and historical information about Mount Rushmore as well as the texts of the documents Borglum wanted to preserve there. The vault consists of a teakwood box (housing the 16 panels) inside of a titanium vault placed in the ground with a granite capstone. The text found on the 16 panels can be found below.\n\n\n== Conservation ==\nThe ongoing conservation of the site is overseen by the National Park Service. Physical efforts to conserve the monument have included replacement of the sealant applied originally to cracks in the stone by Gutzon Borglum, which had proved ineffective at providing water resistance. The components of Borglum's sealant included linseed oil, granite dust, and white lead, but a modern silicone replacement for the cracks is now used, disguised with granite dust.In 1998, electronic monitoring devices were installed to track movement in the topology of the sculpture to an accuracy of three millimeters. The site was digitally recorded in 2009 using a terrestrial laser scanning method as part of the international Scottish Ten project, providing a high-resolution record to aid the conservation of the site. This data was made publicly accessible online.\n\n\n== Ecology ==\n\nThe flora and fauna of Mount Rushmore are similar to those of the rest of the Black Hills region of South Dakota. Birds including the turkey vulture, golden eagle, bald eagle, red-tailed hawk, swallows and white-throated swifts fly around Mount Rushmore, occasionally making nesting spots in the ledges of the mountain. Smaller birds, including songbirds, nuthatches, woodpeckers and flycatchers inhabit the surrounding pine forests. Terrestrial mammals include the mouse, least chipmunk, red squirrel, skunk, porcupine, raccoon, beaver, badger, coyote, bighorn sheep, bobcat, elk, mule deer, yellow-bellied marmot, and American bison. The striped chorus frog, western chorus frog, and northern leopard frog also inhabit the area, along with several species of snake. Grizzly Bear Brook and Starling Basin Brook, the two streams in the memorial, support fish such as the longnose dace and the brook trout. Mountain goats are not indigenous to the region. Those living near Mount Rushmore are descendants of a tribe that Canada gifted to Custer State Park in 1924, which later escaped.At lower elevations, coniferous trees, mainly the ponderosa pine, surround most of the monument, providing shade from the sun. Other trees include the bur oak, the Black Hills spruce, and the cottonwood. Nine species of shrubs grow near Mount Rushmore. There is also a wide variety of wildflowers, including especially the snapdragon, sunflower, and violet. Towards higher elevations, plant life becomes sparser. However, only approximately five percent of the plant species found in the Black Hills are indigenous to the region.The area receives about 18 inches (460 mm) of precipitation on average per year, enough to support abundant animal and plant life. Trees and other plants help to control surface runoff. Dikes, seeps, and springs help to dam up water that is flowing downhill, providing watering spots for animals. In addition, stones like sandstone and limestone help to hold groundwater, creating aquifers.A 2016 investigation by the U.S. Geological Survey found unusually high concentrations of perchlorate in the surface water and groundwater of the area. A sample collected from a stream had a maximum perchlorate concentration of 54 micrograms per liter, roughly 270 times higher than samples taken from locations outside the area. The report concluded the probable cause of the contamination was the aerial fireworks displays that had taken place on Independence Days from 1998 to 2009. The National Park Service also reported that at least 27 forest fires around Mount Rushmore in that same period (1998 to 2009) have been caused by fireworks displays.A study of the fire scars present in tree ring samples indicates that forest fires occur in the ponderosa forests surrounding Mount Rushmore around every 27 years. Large fires are not common. Most events have been ground fires that serve to clear forest debris. The area is a climax community. Recent pine beetle infestations have threatened the forest.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Geology ===\n\nMount Rushmore is largely composed of granite. The memorial is carved on the northwest margin of the Black Elk Peak granite batholith in the Black Hills of South Dakota, so the geologic formations of the heart of the Black Hills region are also evident at Mount Rushmore. The batholith magma intruded into the pre-existing mica schist rocks during the Proterozoic, 1.6 billion years ago. Coarse grained pegmatite dikes are associated with the granite intrusion of Black Elk Peak and are visibly lighter in color, thus explaining the light-colored streaks on the foreheads of the presidents.The Black Hills granites were exposed to erosion during the Neoproterozoic, but were later buried by sandstone and other sediments during the Cambrian. Remaining buried throughout the Paleozoic, they were re-exposed again during the Laramide orogeny around 70 million years ago. The Black Hills area was uplifted as an elongated geologic dome. Subsequent erosion stripped the granite of the overlying sediments and the softer adjacent schist. Some schist does remain and can be seen as the darker material just below the sculpture of Washington.The tallest mountain in the region is Black Elk Peak (7,242 ft or 2,207 m). Borglum selected Mount Rushmore as the site for several reasons. The rock of the mountain is composed of smooth, fine-grained granite. The durable granite erodes only 1 inch (25 mm) every 10,000 years, thus was more than sturdy enough to support the sculpture and its long-term exposure. The mountain's height of 5,725 feet (1,745 m) above sea level made it suitable, and because it faces the southeast, the workers also had the advantage of sunlight for most of the day.\nIt is not possible to add another president to the memorial, because the rock that surrounds the existing faces is not suitable for additional carving, and because if additional sculpting work were done, that might create instabilities in the existing carvings.\n\n\n=== Soils ===\nThe Mount Rushmore area is underlain by well drained alfisol soils of very gravelly loam (Mocmount) to silt loam (Buska) texture, brown to dark grayish brown.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nMount Rushmore has a dry-winter humid continental climate (Dwb in the K\u00f6ppen climate classification). It is inside a USDA Plant Hardiness Zone of 5a, meaning certain plant life in the area can withstand a low temperature of no less than \u221220 \u00b0F (\u221229 \u00b0C).The two wettest months of the year are May and June. Orographic lift causes brief but strong afternoon thunderstorms during the summer.\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\n\nBecause of its fame as a monument, Mount Rushmore has been depicted in multiple places in popular culture.\n\n\n== Controversies ==\n\nThe Treaty of Fort Laramie (1868) had granted the Black Hills to the Lakota people in perpetuity, but the United States took the area from the tribe after the Great Sioux War of 1876. Members of the American Indian Movement led an occupation of the monument in 1971, naming it \"Mount Crazy Horse\", and Lakota holy man John Fire Lame Deer planted a prayer staff on top of the mountain. Lame Deer said that the staff formed a symbolic shroud over the presidents' faces \"which shall remain dirty until the treaties concerning the Black Hills are fulfilled.\"Construction on the Crazy Horse Memorial began in 1940 elsewhere in the Black Hills. Ostensibly to commemorate the Native American leader and as a response to Mount Rushmore, if completed it would be larger than Mount Rushmore. The Crazy Horse Memorial Foundation has rejected offers of federal funds. Its construction has the support of some Lakota chiefs, but it is the subject of controversy, even among Native American tribes.The 1980 United States Supreme Court decision United States v. Sioux Nation of Indians ruled that the Sioux had not received just compensation for their land in the Black Hills, which includes Mount Rushmore. The court proposed $102 million as compensation for the loss of the Black Hills. This compensation was valued at $1.3 billion in 2011, and \u2013 with accumulated interest \u2013 nearly $2 billion in 2021. In 2020, Oglala Lakota Nation citizen and Indigenous activist Nick Tilsen explained that his people would not accept a settlement, \"because we won't settle for anything less than the full return of our lands as stipulated by the treaties our nations signed and agreed upon.\"In 2004, Gerard Baker was appointed superintendent of the park, the first and so far only Native American in that role. Baker stated that he will open up more \"avenues of interpretation\", and that the four presidents are \"only one avenue and only one focus.\"On July 3, 2020, scores of activists demonstrated when President Donald Trump held a campaign rally at Mount Rushmore. The foremost message was that Indigenous people want their land back, pursuant to the ongoing dispute of the Black Hills land claim. Twenty people were arrested.\n\n\n== Legacy and commemoration ==\n\nOn August 11, 1952, the U.S. Post Office issued the Mount Rushmore Memorial 3-cent commemorative stamp on the 25th anniversary of the dedication of the Mount Rushmore National Memorial. On January 2, 1974, a 26-cent airmail stamp depicting the monument was also issued.In 1991 the United States Mint released a commemorative silver dollar celebrating the 50th anniversary of the monument's dedication, and the sculpture was the main subject of the 2006 South Dakota state quarter.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of colossal sculpture in situ\nList of tallest statues\nCrazy Horse Memorial, another large sculpture in the Black Hills\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\n\"Making Mount Rushmore\".

Construction of the 20.5-meter (67 ft) tall arch was headed by American lawyer Sam Hill and dedicated in September 1921. The Peace Arch commemorates the signing of the Treaty of Ghent in 1814, and symbolizes a long history of peace between the two nations. The monument is built on the exact U.S.\u2013Canada boundary, where Interstate 5 on the U.S. side of the border becomes Highway 99 on the Canadian side, in the grass median between the northbound and southbound lanes.\nThe monument and the surrounding land is part of Peace Arch Park. Within the park is Peace Arch Border Crossing, a major border crossing between Interstate 5 and British Columbia Highway 99.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\nThe Peace Arch has the flags of United States and Canada mounted on its crown, and two inscriptions on both sides of its frieze. The inscription on the U.S. side of the Peace Arch reads \"Children of a common mother\" (referring to the two nations' common origin from the British Empire), and the words on the Canadian side read \"Brethren dwelling together in unity\". Within the arch, each side has an iron gate mounted on either side of the border with an inscription above each gate: the one on the east side read \"May these gates never be closed\", while on the west side read \"1814 Open One Hundred Years 1914\".\nThe surrounding park, Peace Arch Park, consists of Peace Arch Provincial Park on the Canadian side and Peace Arch State Park on the American side of the border.\nAbout 500,000 people visit the Peace Arch each year. The monument and surrounding park is considered an international park. As such, visitors do not require either a passport or visa to pass through their applicable border crossing so long as they stay within the boundaries of the park and leave the park into the country from which they entered the park.Because of the Peace Arch monument, the border crossing between Surrey and Blaine is popularly known as the \"Peace Arch Border Crossing\". In Canada, the crossing is officially named Douglas after Sir James Douglas, the first governor of the Colony of British Columbia. It is one of the busiest border crossings between Canada and the United States, and the busiest such crossing west of Detroit.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nBorder inspection services at what is now known as the Peace Arch Border Crossing long predated the 1921 construction of the Peace Arch.In 1914, a Washingtonian lawyer named Samuel Hill organized international fundraising campaign to build the Arch. Internationally known architect H.W. Corbett from London, United Kingdom donated his talents to design the Arch. International volunteers began constructing in 1920. It was dedicated on September 6, 1921, and was considered one of the first earthquake-resistant structures built in North America.The Peace Arch Park has been the site of various international events and protests. In 1952, African-American singer and activist Paul Robeson, banned from international travel during the Red Scares, performed several concerts at the site. He sang from a flatbed truck on the American side to an audience in Canada.\nOne book extensively covers the history of the International Peace Arch. It bears the title, Sam Hill's Peace Arch: Remembrance of Dreams Past by Richard Clark (2005).\nOn February 9, 2010, the Vancouver 2010 Olympic Torch Relay visited the north side of the Peace Arch, while Premier Gordon Campbell and Governor Christine Gregoire addressed a crowd of \"several hundred\" people.\n\n\n== See also ==\nInternational Peace Garden\nCanada\u2013United States relations\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nPeace Arch Park\nPeace Arch Provincial Park, BC\nPeace Arch State Park, WA", "infobox": {"name": "Peace Arch", "image": "Peacearch-usside.jpg", "caption": "The Peace Arch from the U.S. side.", "location": "[[Blaine, Washington|Blaine]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]], U.S.<br>[[Surrey, British Columbia|Surrey]], [[British Columbia]], Canada", "coordinates": "{{coord|49|00|07.7|N|122|45|23.5|W|display|=|inline,title}}", "height": "{{convert|67|ft|m}}", "built": "1921", "architect": "[[Harvey Wiley Corbett]]", "architecture": "Classical Revival", "governing_body": "Local", "designation1": "NRHP", "designation1_date": "December 13, 1996", "designation1_number": "96001493"}, "wikidata": {"heritage designation (P1435)": ["National Register of Historic Places listed place (Q19558910)", "listed in a community heritage register (Q18342392)"], "coordinate location (P625)": {"latitude": 49.00213888888889, "longitude": -122.75652777777778, "altitude": null, "precision": 2.777777777777778e-05, "globe": "http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q2"}, "NRHP reference number (P649)": "96001493", "country (P17)": ["United States of America (Q30)", "Canada (Q16)"], "Canadian Register of Historic Places ID (P477)": ["11452", "18064"], "Commons category (P373)": "Peace Arch", "located in the administrative territorial entity (P131)": ["Surrey (Q390583)", "Blaine (Q1144380)"], "part of (P361)": ["Peace Arch Park (Q192531)", "Canada\u2013United States border (Q119515)"], "instance of (P31)": "monument (Q4989906)", "Freebase ID (P646)": "/m/01__4z", "GeoNames ID (P1566)": "7715696", "commemorates (P547)": "Treaty of Ghent (Q1324198)", "color (P462)": "white (Q23444)", "image (P18)": "Peacearch-usside.jpg", "inception (P571)": "+1921-00-00T00:00:00Z", "architect (P84)": "Harvey Wiley Corbett (Q5677699)", "official website (P856)": "http://www.peacearchpark.org", "native label (P1705)": "Peace Arch", "archINFORM project ID (P5383)": "75544", "architectural style (P149)": "neoclassicism (Q14378)", "continent (P30)": "North America (Q49)", "catalog code (P528)": "DgRq-43", "located in protected area (P3018)": "Peace Arch Park (Q192531)", "Getty Thesaurus of Geographic Names ID (P1667)": "1100929"}, "cat": "Monuments_and_memorials", "url": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peace_Arch", "wikibase": "Q2000846"}, {"name": "Stone Mountain", "url_name": "320118", "txt": "Stone Mountain is a quartz monzonite dome monadnock and the site of Stone Mountain Park, 16 miles (26 km) east of Atlanta, Georgia. Outside the park is the small city of Stone Mountain, Georgia. The park is the most visited tourist site in the state of Georgia.\nThe park is owned by the state of Georgia and is currently managed by Herschend Family Entertainment. At its summit, the elevation is 1,686 feet (514 m) above sea level and 825 feet (251 m) above the surrounding area. Stone Mountain is well known for not only its geology, but also the enormous rock relief on its north face, the largest bas-relief artwork in the world.  The carving, completed in 1972, depicts three Confederate leaders, Jefferson Davis, Robert E. Lee, and Stonewall Jackson.Stone Mountain, once owned by the Venable Brothers, was seen from the outset  \"as a memorial to the Confederacy.\" Stone Mountain Park officially opened on April 14, 1965 \u2013 100 years to the day after Lincoln's assassination, although the park had already been in use for a few years.\n\nThe mountain, which ranges in composition from quartz monzonite to granite and granodiorite, is more than 5 miles (8 km) in circumference at its base. The summit of the mountain can be reached by a walk-up trail on the west side of the mountain or by the Skyride aerial tram.\n\n\n== Geology ==\n\nStone Mountain is a pluton, a type of igneous intrusion. Primarily composed of quartz monzonite, the dome of Stone Mountain was formed during the formation of the Blue Ridge Mountains around 300\u2013350 million years ago (during the Carboniferous period), part of the Appalachian Mountains. It formed as a result of the upwelling of magma from within the Earth's crust. This magma solidified to form granite within the crust five to ten miles below the surface.\nThe Stone Mountain pluton continues underground 9 miles (14 km) at its longest point into Gwinnett County. Numerous reference books and Georgia literature have dubbed Stone Mountain as \"the largest exposed piece of granite in the world\". This misconception is most likely a result of misrepresentation by granite companies and early park administration. Stone Mountain, though often called a pink granite dome, actually ranges in composition from quartz monzonite to granite and granodiorite.The minerals within the rock include quartz, plagioclase feldspar, microcline, and muscovite, with smaller amounts of biotite and tourmaline. The tourmaline is mostly black in color, and the majority of it exists as optically continuous skeletal crystals, but much larger, euhedral pegmatitic tourmaline crystals can also be found in the mountain's numerous, cross-cutting felsic dikes.\nEmbedded in the granite are xenoliths or pieces of foreign rocks entrained in the magma.\nThe granite intruded into the metamorphic rocks of the Piedmont region during the last stages of the Alleghenian Orogeny, which was the time when North America and North Africa collided. Over time, erosion eventually exposed the present mountain of more resistant igneous rock. This intrusion of granite also gave rise to Panola Mountain and Arabia Mountain, both in DeKalb County, smaller outcroppings farther south of Stone Mountain.\n\n\n== Natural history ==\n\nThe top of the mountain is a landscape of bare rock and rock pools, and it provides views of the surrounding area including the skyline of downtown Atlanta, often Kennesaw Mountain, and on very clear days even the Appalachian Mountains. On some days, the top of the mountain is shrouded in a heavy fog, and visibility may be limited to only a few feet.\nThe clear freshwater pools on the summit form by rainwater gathering in eroded depressions, and are home to unusual clam shrimp and fairy shrimp. The tiny shrimp appear only during the rainy season. Through the process of cryptobiosis, the tiny shrimp eggs (or cysts) can remain dormant for years in the dried out depressions, awaiting favorable conditions. These vernal pools are also home to several federally listed rare and endangered plant species, such as black-spored quillwort (Isoetes melanospora) and pool sprite (also called snorkelwort, Gratiola amphiantha).The mountain's lower slopes are wooded. The rare Georgia oak was first discovered at the summit, and several specimens can easily be found along the walk-up trail and in the woods around the base of the mountain. In the fall, the Confederate yellow daisy (Helianthus porteri) flowers appear on the mountain, growing in rock crevices and in the large wooded areas. More than 120 wildflowers, most of them native to the Southern Appalachians and including several rare or federally protected species, have been identified on the mountain.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Confederate Memorial Carving ==\n\nThe largest bas-relief sculpture in the world, the Confederate Memorial Carving depicts three Confederate leaders of the Civil War: President Jefferson Davis and Generals Robert E. Lee and Thomas J. \"Stonewall\" Jackson (on their favorite horses, Blackjack, Traveller, and Little Sorrel, respectively). The sculpture was cut 42 feet (13 m) deep into the mountain, measures 90 feet (27 m) in height and 190 feet (58 m) in width, and lies 400 feet (120 m) above the ground.David Freeman, writing on the origins of the memorial, states: \"Who first conceived of a Confederate memorial on the side of Stone Mountain has long been a matter of debate..... The written evidence...points to Francis Ticknor, a nineteenth-century physician and poet from Jones County, Georgia...in an 1869 poem.... William H. Terrell, an Atlanta attorney and son of a Confederate veteran, ...suggested it publicly on May 26, 1914 in an editorial for the Atlanta Constitution.\":\u200a55\u200a  Three weeks later, Georgian John Temple Graves, editor of the New York American, suggested it should have a 70-foot (21 m) statue of Robert E. Lee.:\u200a56\u200aThe project was greatly advanced by C. Helen Plane, a charter member of the United Daughters of the Confederacy (UDC) and first president and Honorary Life President of the Georgia State Division.:\u200a57\u200a After obtaining the approval of the Georgia UDC, she set up the UDC Stone Mountain Memorial Association. She chose the sculptor Gutzon Borglum for the project and invited him to visit the mountain (although, despite his Ku Klux Klan involvement,:\u200a79\u200a she \"would not shake his hand\u2014he was, after all, a Yankee\").:\u200a58\u201359\u200a She met him at the Atlanta train station, took him to her family's summer home, Mont Rest, at the foot of the mountain, and introduced him to Sam Venable,:\u200a59\u200a an active Klan member and owner of the mountain. Borglum also enlisted Luigi Del Bianco, whom he would also involve in Mount Rushmore.Borglum's original plan was: five groups of figures, sixty-five mounted officers representing the states (to be chosen by the states), General Nathan Bedford Forrest and his cavalry\u2014some 700 to 1,000 figures, each from 35 feet (11 m) to 50 feet (15 m) high. In addition, Borglum planned a room cut 60 feet (18 m) into the mountain, 320 feet (98 m) wide, and 40 feet (12 m) high, faced by 13 columns.:\u200a59\u201360\u200aVenable deeded the north face of the mountain to the UDC in 1916, on condition that it complete a sizable Civil War monument in 12 years. Finances as well as technical problems slowed progress. The US Mint issued a 1925 Commemorative silver US half dollar, bearing the words \"Stone Mountain\", as a fundraiser for the monument. This issue, which required the approval of both the 1926 Congress and President Calvin Coolidge, was the largest issue of commemorative coins by the U.S. government up to that time.:\u200a81\u200aFinancial conflicts between Borglum and the Association led to his firing in 1925.:\u200a85\u200a He destroyed his models, claiming that they were his property, but the Association disagreed and had a warrant issued for his arrest. He was warned of the arrest and narrowly escaped to North Carolina, whose governor, Angus McLean, refused to extradite him,:\u200a89\u200a though he could not return to Georgia. The affair was highly publicized and there was much discussion and discord, including discord between Sam Venable, the Association, and its president Hollins Randolph.:\u200a103,\u200a116\u2013119\u200a The face of Lee that Borglum had partially completed was blasted off the mountain in 1928.:\u200a111\u200aBorglum's next major project was Mount Rushmore.\nAfter a number of sculptors turned them down,:\u200a97\u200a Augustus Lukeman took up the work in 1925, with a different, smaller design. Fundraising was even more difficult after the public debate and name-calling, and work stopped in 1928. In 1941 segregationist Governor Eugene Talmadge formed the Stone Mountain Memorial Association (SMMA) to continue work on the memorial, but the project was delayed once again by the U.S. entry into World War II (1941\u201345).In response to Brown v. Board of Education of 1954 and the birth of the Civil Rights Movement, in 1958, at the urging of segregationist Governor Marvin Griffin,:\u200a21\u200a the Georgia legislature approved a measure to purchase Stone Mountain at a price of $1,125,000. In 1963 Walker Hancock was selected to complete the carving, and work began in 1964. The carving was dedicated in a ceremony on May 9, 1970. The carving was completed by Roy Faulkner on March 3, 1972. Faulkner in 1985 opened the Stone Mountain Carving Museum (now closed) on nearby Memorial Drive commemorating the carving's history. An extensive archival collection related to the project is now at Emory University, with the bulk of the materials dating from 1915 to 1930; the finding aid provides a history of the project, and an index of the papers contained in the collection.Four flags of the Confederacy are flown at the site. The Stone Mountain Memorial Lawn \"contains...thirteen terraces\u2014one for each Confederate state.... Each terrace flies the flag that the state flew as member of the Confederacy.\"\n\n\n=== The replica plantation ===\nIn 1963, there opened beneath the sculpture a replica plantation, where slave quarters were described as \u201cneat\u201d and \u201cwell furnished\u201d in promotional materials. The slaves were called \u201chands\u201d or \u201cworkers,\u201d and Black actress Butterfly McQueen (from Gone with the Wind) was hired to guide and inform visitors. The park states that the plantation was inspired by Gone with the Wind. The plantation has been renamed Historic Square.\n\n\n=== Involvement of the Ku Klux Klan ===\n\nAccording to sociologist James W. Loewen,  Stone Mountain was \"the sacred site to members of the second and third national klans.\":\u200a262\u200a Loewen alleges that the rebirth of the Ku Klux Klan\u2014the second Klan\u2014was inspired by D. W. Griffith's 1915 Klan-glorifying film, The Birth of a Nation. It was followed in August by the highly publicized lynching of Leo Frank, who had been wrongly convicted of murder, in nearby Marietta, Georgia. Loewen further alleges that on November 25 of the same year, Thanksgiving Day, a small group, including fifteen robed and hooded \"charter members\" of the new organization, met at the summit of Stone Mountain to create a new iteration of the Klan. Led by William J. Simmons, it included two elderly members of the original Klan. As part of their ceremony, they set up on the summit an altar covered with a flag, opened a Bible, and burned a 16-foot cross.:\u200a20\u200aJames R. Venable attended the 1915 revival of the KKK on top of Stone Mountain and later became an Imperial Wizard of the National Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, which was one of the later KKK factions. He owned land at the base of the mountain that he had inherited from his ancestors, and in October of 1923 he granted the Klan an easement with perpetual right to hold celebrations as they desired. However, the property was condemned in 1960 at the behest of the  Stone Mountain Memorial Association.The Klan also held cross-burnings at the summit of the mountain on different occasions from 1915 onward. This practice came to an end in 1962, when the Klan attempted to hold a mountaintop cross-burning in response to the NAACP holding its national convention in Atlanta. The Stone Mountain Memorial Association did not want either group using state property for demonstrations, and convinced Governor Ernest Vandiver to order state troopers to stop the event. Seventy troopers attempted to stop several hundred Klansmen gathered at the base of the mountain from climbing to the summit, but the Klansmen were armed with billy clubs, flashlights, and stones, and greatly outnumbered the officers. The police negotiated a truce with the local Klan Grand Dragon, under which the Klansmen would refrain from further violence, but 20 of their number would be allowed climb the mountain for a \u201creligious ceremony,\u201d and the crossburning was substituted with the lighting of a flare.In August of 2017, the Klan was denied a permit for a mountaintop cross-burning.Fundraising for the monument resumed in 1923. The influence of the UDC continued, in support of Mrs. Plane's vision of a carving explicitly for the purpose of creating a Confederate memorial. She suggested in a letter to the first sculptor, Gutzon Borglum:\n\nI feel it is due to the Klan[,] which saved us from Negro dominations [sic] and carpetbag rule, that it be immortalized on Stone Mountain. Why not represent a small group of them in their nightly uniform approaching in the distance?:\u200a21\u200a\nThe UDC established the Stone Mountain Confederate Memorial Association (SMCMA) for fundraising and on-site supervision of the project. Venable and Borglum, both closely associated with the Klan, arranged to pack the SMCMA with Klan members. The SMCMA, along with the United Daughters of the Confederacy, continued fundraising efforts. Of the $250,000 raised, part came from the federal government, which in 1925 issued commemorative fifty-cent coins with the soldiers Robert E. Lee and Stonewall Jackson on them.  The image on the verso of the coin was based on The Last Meeting of Lee and Jackson, executed in 1869 by Everett B. D. Fabrino Julio (American, b. St. Helena 1843 \u2013 1879, emigrated to the U.S. 1860), itself an icon of Lost Cause mythology; it is now in the American Civil War Museum (until 2012 the Museum of the Confederacy). When the state completed the purchase in 1960, it condemned the property to void Venable's agreement to allow the Klan perpetual right to hold meetings on the premises.\n\n\n=== Proposed removal of the carving ===\n\nAfter the Charleston church shooting in mid-2015, Stone Mountain was the subject of a political debate related to the removal of symbols of the Confederacy. This controversy was stimulated by a movement in other states to remove the Confederate battle flag and statues of Confederate leaders from public areas.\n\n[The Confederate sculpture at Stone Mountain is] the largest shrine to white supremacy in the history of the world ... I don't think people understand the objective and the intent. They don't understand that it's based on white supremacy because the [American Civil War] was based on white supremacy, and the 'heroes' are based on white supremacy. After the killings at Emanuel Church in Charleston, it finally crystallized for me that these monuments encourage violence and validate oppression.\nIn July 2015, the Atlanta NAACP proposed removing the Confederate carving from Stone Mountain Park. However, this would require the approval of the Georgia Legislature, as would any change to a \"military monument\" in the state.On October 11, 2015, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported the park was considering a proposal of a permanent \"Freedom Bell\" honoring Martin Luther King Jr. and the line \"Let freedom ring from Stone Mountain of Georgia\", from King's 1963 \"I Have a Dream\" speech. The proposed monument is inspired by a bell-ringing ceremony held in 2013 honoring the 50th anniversary of King's speech. It is not supported by the NAACP or King-founded Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC), who want the Confederate symbols removed rather than a King symbol added. Advance Local reported in 2015 that both the DeKalb County branch of the NAACP and the Sons of Confederate Veterans were opposed to the bell because it would have been put next to a Confederate monument. Representatives of the NAACP were quoted in the article saying \"It's an attempt to gain support from blacks to keep these racist and demeaning symbols.\"In August 2017, after the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia\u2014a white nationalist protest against the removal of the Robert E. Lee monument and Stonewall Jackson sculpture\u2014turned violent, many people across the country again demanded the removal of many Confederate monuments and memorials as a part of a national political debate. Georgia State Representative and Democratic gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams called for the removal, by sandblasting, of Stone Mountain's carving. She called it \"a blight upon our state\".On July 5, 2020, 100 to 200 armed protesters came to Stone Mountain to call for the carving's removal. Known as the Not Fucking Around Coalition (NFAC), it was a protest against both overt and systemic racism, calling out white supremacists, with the location being chosen in part due to its history as the place where the Ku Klux Klan was re-formed.On August 15, 2020, the park administration closed its gates in reaction to a gathering of white nationalists planned there, and the city's public buses were suspended for the day. Nevertheless a fight broke out between the gatherers downtown and counter-protesters downtown, with no injuries.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nHuman habitation of Stone Mountain and its surroundings date back into prehistory. When the mountain was first encountered by European explorers, its summit was encircled by a rock wall, similar to that still to be found on Georgia's Fort Mountain. The wall is believed to have been built by early Native American inhabitants of the area, although its purpose remains unclear. By the beginning of the 20th century, the wall had disappeared, the rocks having been taken away by early visitors as souvenirs, rolled down the rockface, or removed by the commercial quarrying operation.  The mountain was the eastern end of the Campbellton Trail, a Native American path that ran through what is now the Atlanta area.\nEuropeans first learned of the mountain in 1567, when Spanish explorers were told of a mountain farther inland which was \"very high, shining when the sun set like a fire.\" By this time, the Stone Mountain area was inhabited by the Creek and (to a lesser extent) Cherokee peoples.\nIn the early 19th century, the area was known as Rock Mountain.  After the founding of DeKalb County and the county seat of Decatur in 1822, Stone Mountain was a natural recreation area; it was common for young couples on dates to ride to the mountain on horseback. The mountain is easy to climb and there has been a path since the nineteenth century.\nEntrepreneur Aaron Cloud built a 165 feet (50 m) wooden observation tower at the summit of the mountain in 1838, but it was destroyed by a storm and replaced by a much smaller tower in 1851. Visitors to the mountain would travel to the area by rail and road, and then walk up the 1.1-mile (1.8 km) mountaintop trail to the top, where Cloud also had a restaurant and club.\nGranite quarrying started at Stone Mountain in the 1830s, but became a major industry following the completion of a railroad spur to the quarry site in 1847. This line was rebuilt by the Georgia Railroad in 1869. Over the years, Stone Mountain granite was used in many buildings and structures, including the locks of the Panama Canal, the steps to the East Wing of the United States Capitol and the Imperial Hotel in Tokyo. In recent years, granite suppliers in Georgia sent stone samples cut from Stone Mountain to the group responsible for planning the Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial in Washington, D.C.; the foundation later chose to use granite imported from China. Quarrying during earlier periods also destroyed several spectacular geological features on Stone Mountain, such as the Devil's Crossroads, which was located on top of the mountain.\nIn 1887, Stone Mountain was purchased for $45,000 by the Venable Brothers of Atlanta, who quarried the mountain for 24 more years, and descendants of the Venable family would retain ownership of the mountain until it was purchased by the State of Georgia in 1958.\nMartin Luther King Jr. mentioned the monument in his \"I Have a Dream\" speech at the August 1963 March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom, when he said \"let freedom ring from Stone Mountain of Georgia!\"During the 1996 Summer Olympics, Stone Mountain Park provided venues for Olympic events in tennis, archery and track cycling. The venues for archery and cycling were temporary and are now part of the songbird and habitat trail.Some of the outdoor scenes for the Netflix series Stranger Things were filmed in the park.\n\n\n=== Aviation incidents ===\nAccording to George Weiblen's annotated calendar for Monday, May 7, 1928: \"Mail plane crashed on mountain at 8:00 P.M.\" The pilot, Johnny S. Kytle (1905\u20131931), not only survived the crash, but managed to grab the mail and walk down the mountain.\nAround dusk on September 16, 2003, in clear weather, a small airplane circled the mountain five times, crashed headlong into the south side, and burst into flames. The pilot was killed. A witness testifying at the NTSB investigation stated that the pilot, a 69-year-old accountant, had threatened on multiple occasions to commit suicide by flying into the mountain. The official NTSB accident report lists the probable cause as \"The pilot's intentional flight into the ground for the purpose of suicide while impaired by alcohol.\"\n\n\n=== Governance ===\nStone Mountain Park, which surrounds the Confederate Memorial, is owned by the state of Georgia and managed by the Stone Mountain Memorial Association, a Georgia state authority.  The Herschend Family Entertainment Corporation had a 30-year contract to operate park attractions while the Stone Mountain Memorial Association retains ownership and the right to reject any project deemed unfit. Under terms of a 1999 agreement, Herschend pays the state of Georgia $11 million annually. In 2018, Herschend Family Entertainment Corporation decided to end their contract early after only 20 years due to record losses in 2017 and 2018, citing decreased revenues and \u201cprotests and division\u201d fueled by the park\u2019s ubiquitous Confederate imagery as factors. Bids for a new management company for Stone Mountain Park were submitted in October 2021 and are to be chosen February 2022. Currently the only bid is from Thrive Attractions Management Group, LLC, started by the previous Vice President of Herschend Family Entertainment Corporation and general manager of Stone Mountain Park for 10 years, Michael Dombrowski. There were no other bids submitted to the Mountain Memorial Association. The Herschend Family Entertainment Corporation is set to pull out by summer 2022.\n\n\n== Places of interest ==\n\nConfederate Hall, operated directly by the Stone Mountain Memorial Association (SMMA), is a museum that educates students and park guests on the geology and ecology of Stone Mountain as well as historical aspects of the area. A small theater shows a historical documentary about the Civil War in Georgia called The Battle for Georgia.\nThe education department is host to thousands of students each school year, teaching the subjects of geology, ecology, and history. Classes are designed to meet the Georgia Performance Standards and the North American Association for Environmental Education guidelines.\nThe Antebellum Plantation and Farmyard is an open-air museum composed of 19 historic buildings, built between 1790 and 1875, which have been re-erected on the site to represent a pre-Civil War Georgia plantation. The historic houses have been furnished with an extensive collection of period furniture and decorations. The farm features a petting zoo.\n\nA grist mill dates from 1869 and moved to the park in 1965. A covered bridge dates from 1892, which originally spanned the Oconee River in Athens, Georgia.The park provides daily concerts on a large carillon that originated at the 1964 New York World's Fair. The instrument consists of 732 bell-tone rods, electronically amplified through 60 speakers in a decorative 13-story structure.\n\n\n=== Broadcast tower ===\n\nThe short broadcast tower on the top of the mountain transmits two non-commercial stations: television station WGTV TV 8, and weather radio station KEC80 on 162.55 MHz.  FM radio station WABE FM 90.1 was located on this tower from 1984 until 2005, when it was required to relocate to accommodate WGTV's digital conversion.  W266BW FM 101.1 now has a permit as well. Atop the tower also sits the W4BOC amateur radio repeater, which operates on a frequency of 146.760 MHz.\nThe tower is also used for the park's Project 25 two-way radio systems.\n\n\n=== Scenic railroad ===\n\n\n=== Stone Mountain trails ===\n\nWalk Up Trail is a 1.3-mile (2.1 km) trail to the top of Stone Mountain ascending 786 ft (240 m) in elevation to a height of 1,686 ft (514 m). The trail is steep, but spectacular panoramic views and cool winds await hikers at the top.\nCherokee Trail is an 8-mile (13 km) National Recreation Trail. It loops around the mountain base, with a mile section going up and over the west side of the mountain (crosses Walk Up Trail). It passes primarily through an oak-hickory forest, but views of the lakes, streams, and mountain are common.\nNature Garden Trail is a scenic 3\u20444 mile (1.2 km) loop trail through a mature oak-hickory forest community, it is excellent for viewing shade-loving native plants. A small garden with interpretive native plant signs is at the entrance to the trail.\nSongbird Habitat Trails comprise two loop trails each running 1 mile (1.6 km). The field trail is a birding spot and the woodland trail provides shade and numerous native plants. Dogs are not allowed.\n\n\n=== Park attractions ===\nThe park features several attractions that are operated by Herschend Family Entertainment Corporation. The Skyride, a Swiss-built cable car to the summit of the mountain, passes by the carving on the way up.\nHistoric Square is a collection of historic buildings relocated from around the state of Georgia, including three plantation manor-houses dating from 1794, 1850, and 1845; two slave cabins; a barn; and other outbuildings. The Historic Square Farmyard features historic breeds of sheep, goats, and pigs.\nCrossroads is a recreation of an 1872 southern town with several attractions that include a modern 4-D movie theater, an adventure mini-golf course, a duck tour ride. The duck boats have been replaced by the Rockin\u2019 Land and Lake Tour in 2019 due to several deaths in other locations caused by duck boat accidents. The tour includes a ride on a double decker open top bus and a pontoon boat ride at the marina.) stores and restaurants.  Craft demonstrators include glass blowing and candy-making.\nThe Dinotorium is a children's activity area that features 65 interactive games, climbing structures, trampoline floors, and slides. Sky Hike is a family ropes adventure course; Geyser Towers is a playground featuring a large fountain at the entrance.\nThe since-retired Riverboat offered a scenic cruise aboard a reproduction of a Mississippi riverboat on 363-acre (147 ha) Stone Mountain Lake.\nOn summer evenings the mountain hosts the Stone Mountain Laser Show Spectacular, a fireworks and laser lighting display. The laser light show projects images of the Deep South as well as Georgia history onto the Confederate Memorial carving. During Memorial Day Weekend of 2011, Stone Mountain unveiled its overhaul of the laser show, dubbed Mountainvision, which incorporates digital projections, lasers, special effects, and pyrotechnics.The Antique Car and Treasure Museum was formerly located in the park; its contents were auctioned in 2009.  It included jukeboxes, player pianos, band organs, toys, trains, radios, clocks, and numerous other vintage exhibits.\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\nMartin Luther King Jr. mentioned the monument in his \"I Have a Dream\" speech at the August 1963 March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom, when he said \"let freedom ring from Stone Mountain of Georgia!\"Photography of the mountain by artist Isaac Diggs is featured in Vanity Fair's November 2020 coverage of the 2020 presidential election, representing Georgia.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of colossal sculpture in situ\nStone Mountain Memorial half dollar\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nBoissoneault, Lorraine (August 22, 2017). \"What Will Happen to Stone Mountain, America's Largest Confederate Memorial?\".

The memorial is located in downtown Oklahoma City on the former site of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building, which was destroyed in the 1995 bombing.  This building was located on NW 5th Street between N. Robinson Avenue and N. Harvey Avenue.\nThe national memorial was authorized on October 9, 1997, by President Bill Clinton's signing of the Oklahoma City National Memorial Act of 1997. It was administratively listed on the National Register of Historic Places the same day. The memorial is administered by Oklahoma City National Memorial Foundation, with National Park Service staff to help interpret the memorial for visitors.\nThe memorial was formally dedicated on April 19, 2000: the fifth anniversary of the bombing.  The museum was dedicated and opened the following year on February 19.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nOn April 19, 1995, Timothy McVeigh parked a Ryder rental truck filled with explosives in front of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building. The resulting explosion killed 168 people and destroyed the entire north face of the building.Months after the attack, Mayor Ron Norick appointed a task force to look into a creation of a permanent memorial where the Murrah building once stood. The Task Force called for 'a symbolic outdoor memorial', a Memorial Museum, and for creation of Oklahoma City National Memorial Institute for the Prevention of Terrorism. Six hundred and twenty four designs were submitted for the memorial and in July 1997 a design by Butzer Design Partnership, which consists of husband and wife Hans and Torrey Butzer, was chosen.In October 1997, President Bill Clinton signed law creating the Oklahoma City National Memorial as a unit of the National Park Service to be operated by the Oklahoma City National Memorial Trust. The total cost of the memorial was $29.1 million; $10 million for the Outdoor Symbolic Memorial, $7 million for the Memorial Museum, $5 million for the Memorial Institute for the Prevention of Terrorism and the rest for other costs. The federal government appropriated $5 million for construction with the state of Oklahoma matching that amount. More than $17 million in private donations was raised.On April 19, 2000, the fifth anniversary of the attack, the Outdoor Symbolic Memorial was dedicated. On February 19, 2001, the Memorial Museum was dedicated. In 2004 it was transferred from the NPS to the Oklahoma City National Memorial Foundation, designating it an affiliated area of National Park System. The Oklahoma City National Memorial since its opening has seen over 4.4 million visitors to the Outdoor Symbolic Memorial and 1.6 million visitors to the Memorial Museum. The Memorial has an average of 350,000 visitors per year.\n\n\n== Memorial features ==\n\nThe Outdoor Symbolic Memorial consists of the following segments on 3.3 acres (13,000 m2), and are accessible day or night.\n\nThe Gates of Time: Monumental twin bronze gates frame the moment of destruction \u2013 9:02 \u2013 and mark the formal entrances to the Outdoor Memorial. 9:01, found on the eastern gate, represents the last moments of peace, while its opposite on the western gate, 9:03, represents the first moments of recovery. Both time stamps are inscribed on the interior of the monument, facing each other and the Reflecting Pool.The outside of each gate bears this inscription:\nReflecting Pool: A thin layer of water flows over polished black granite to form the pool, which runs east to west down the center of the Memorial (also see reflecting pool) on what was once Fifth Street.  Although the pool is flowing, visitors are able to see a mirror image of themselves in the water. Visitors seeing their reflections are said to be seeing \"someone changed forever by what happened here.\"\nField of Empty Chairs: One hundred and sixty-eight empty chairs hand-crafted from glass, bronze, and stone represent those who lost their lives, with a name etched in the glass base of each. They sit on the site where the Murrah Building once stood. The chairs are arranged in nine rows to symbolize the nine floors of the building; each person's chair is on the row (or the floor) on which the person worked or was located when the bomb went off. The chairs are also grouped according to the blast pattern, with the most chairs nearest the most heavily damaged portion of the building. The westernmost column of five chairs represents the five people who died but were not in the Murrah Building (two in the Water Resources Board building, one in the Athenian Building, one outside near the building, and one rescuer). The 19 smaller chairs represent the children killed in the bombing. Three unborn children died along with their mothers, and they are listed on their mothers' chairs beneath their mothers' names.\nSurvivors' Wall: The only remaining original portions of the Murrah Building are the north and east walls, known as the Survivors' Wall. The wall has several panels of granite salvaged from the Murrah Building itself, inscribed with the names of more than 600 survivors from the building and the surrounding area, many of whom were injured in the blast.\nSurvivor Tree: An American elm on the north side of the Memorial that was heavily damaged by the bomb, but survived. Hundreds of seeds from the Survivor Tree are planted annually and the resulting saplings are distributed each year on the anniversary of the bombing. Thousands of Survivor Trees are growing in public and private places all over the U.S.\nThe Memorial Fence: A 10-foot-tall (3.0 m) chain link fence was installed around the area that is now the Reflecting Pool and the Field of Empty Chairs to protect the site from damage and visitors from injury. The Fence stood for more than four years, becoming notable as the place where visitors left stuffed animals, poems, keychains, and other items as tributes.  During the construction of the Outdoor Memorial, 210 feet (64 m) of the Fence was moved to the west side of the Memorial, along the 9:03 side or the 'healing' side. The remainder of the Fence is in storage. Visitors may still leave small items along and in the Fence; the mementos are periodically collected, cataloged, and stored.\nRescuers' Orchard: A grove of Oklahoma redbuds (Oklahoma's state tree), Amur Maple, Chinese Pistache, and Bosque Elm trees are planted on the lawn around the Survivor Tree. The trees represent the rescuers who came to the aid of the survivors; hence the rescuers' orchard surrounds the survivor tree. The non-native species represent those rescuers who came from outside Oklahoma to help.\nChildren's Area: More than 5,000 hand-painted tiles, from all over the United States and Canada, were made by children and sent to Oklahoma City after the bombing in 1995. Most are stored in the Memorial's Archives, and a sampling of tiles is on the wall in the Children's Area. Chalkboards provide a place where children can draw and share their feelings. The Children's Area is north of the 9:03 gate, on the west side of the Museum.\nJournal Record Building: North of the memorial is the Journal Record Building, which formerly housed the offices of The Journal Record.  It now houses the Oklahoma City National Memorial Museum, which features numerous exhibits and artifacts related to the Oklahoma City bombing.\nAlfred P. Murrah Federal Building Plaza: Located just south of the Field of Empty Chairs, above the underground parking garage, is the raised Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building Plaza.  An original part of the federal building, the plaza had a garden and seating areas, as well as a playground for the daycare center. Visitors to the Memorial can walk across the plaza, where the original flagpole is used for the American flag.\n\n\n== Adjacent memorials ==\nTwo churches were located across the street from the Murrah Building. Both were heavily damaged by the blast. Each church was repaired and both constructed memorials on their property. While not part of the official memorial they are open to the public.\n\nHeartland Chapel: Across the street from the 9:01 gate is an open air wooden chapel erected by First United Methodist Church of Oklahoma City.  The altar is made from church stones damaged by the bombing. A substantial portion of the funding for the chapel was provided by the Jewish community.\nAnd Jesus Wept: Across the street from the 9:03 gate is a sculpture of Jesus weeping erected by St. Joseph's Catholic Church, one of the first brick-and-mortar churches built in the city. Jesus faces away from the devastation, covering his face with his hand. In front of Jesus is a wall with 168 gaps in it, representing the voids left by each life lost.\n\n\n== References ==\n\nBibliographyThe National Parks: Index 2001\u20132003.

The attack on Pearl Harbor led to the United States' involvement in World War II.\nThe memorial, built in 1962, is visited by more than two million people annually. Accessible only by boat, it straddles the sunken hull of the battleship without touching it. Historical information about the attack, shuttle boats to and from the memorial, and general visitor services are available at the associated USS Arizona Memorial Visitor Center, which opened in 1980 and is operated by the National Park Service. The battleship's sunken remains were declared a National Historic Landmark on May 5, 1989.The USS Arizona Memorial is one of several sites in Hawaii that are part of the Pearl Harbor National Memorial.\n\n\n== Memorial ==\n\n\n=== Conception and funding ===\n\nDuring and following the end of World War II, Arizona's wrecked superstructure was removed and efforts began to erect a memorial at the remaining submerged hull.\nRobert Ripley, of Ripley's Believe It or Not! fame, visited Pearl Harbor in 1942. Six years later, in 1948, he did a radio broadcast from Pearl Harbor. Following that broadcast, with the help of his longtime friend Doug Storer, he got in contact with the Department of the Navy. He wrote letters to Rear Admiral J.J. Manning of the Bureau of Yards and Docks regarding his desire for a permanent memorial.\n\nWhile Ripley's original idea for a memorial was disregarded due to the cost, the Navy continued with the idea of creating a memorial. The Pacific War Memorial Commission was created in 1949 to build a permanent memorial in Hawaii. Admiral Arthur W. Radford, commander of the Pacific Fleet, attached a flag pole to the main mast of the Arizona in 1950, and began a tradition of hoisting and lowering the flag. In that same year a temporary memorial was built above the remaining portion of the deckhouse. Radford requested funds for a national memorial in 1951 and 1952, but was denied because of budget constraints during the Korean War.\nThe Navy placed the first permanent memorial, a 10-foot (3 m)-tall basalt stone and plaque, over the mid-ship deckhouse on December 7, 1955. President Dwight D. Eisenhower approved the creation of a National Memorial in 1958. Enabling legislation required the memorial, budgeted at $500,000, be privately financed; however, $200,000 of the memorial cost was government subsidized.\nPrincipal contributions to the memorial included:\n\n$50,000 Territory of Hawai\u02bbi initial contribution in 1958\n$95,000 privately raised following a 1958 This Is Your Life television segment featuring Rear Admiral (ret.) Samuel G. Fuqua, Medal of Honor recipient and the senior surviving officer from the Arizona\n$64,000 from a March 25, 1961 benefit concert by Elvis Presley, which was his final live performance until 1968\n$40,000 from the sale of plastic models of the Arizona, in a partnership between the Fleet Reserve Association and Revell Model Company\n$150,000 from federal funds in legislation initiated by Hawaii Senator Daniel Inouye in 1961During planning stages, the memorial's purpose was the subject of competing visions. Some were eager to keep it a tribute to the sailors of the Arizona, while others expected a dedication to all who died in the Pacific theater. In the end, the legislation authorizing and funding the memorial (HR 44, 1961) declared that the Arizona would \"be maintained in honor and commemoration of the members of the Armed Forces of the United States who gave their lives to their country during the attack on Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, on December 7, 1941.\"\n\n\n=== Design ===\n\nThe national memorial was designed by Honolulu architect Alfred Preis, who was detained at Sand Island at the start of the war as an enemy of the country, because of his Austrian birth. The United States Navy specified the memorial be in the form of a bridge floating above the ship and accommodating 200 people.The 184-foot-long (56 m) structure has two peaks at each end connected by a sag in the center of the structure. Critics initially called the design a \"squashed milk carton\".The architecture of the USS Arizona Memorial is explained by Preis as, \"Wherein the structure sags in the center but stands strong and vigorous at the ends, expresses initial defeat and ultimate victory ... The overall effect is one of serenity. Overtones of sadness have been omitted, to permit the individual to contemplate his own personal responses ... his innermost feelings.\"\n\n\n=== Description ===\n\nThe national memorial has three main parts: entry, assembly room, and shrine. The central assembly room features seven large open windows on either wall and ceiling, to commemorate the date of the attack. There are rumors that the 21 windows symbolically represent a 21-gun salute or 21 Marines standing at eternal parade rest over the tomb of the fallen, but guides at the site have confirmed that this was not the architect's intention. The memorial also has an opening in the floor overlooking the sunken decks. It is from this opening that visitors can pay their respects by tossing flowers in honor of the fallen sailors. In the past, leis were tossed in the water, but because string from leis poses a hazard to sea life, leis now are placed on guardrails in front of the names of the fallen.\nOne of Arizona's three 19,585-pound (8,884 kg) anchors is displayed at the visitor center's entrance. (One of the other two is at the Arizona State Capitol in Phoenix.) One of the two ship's bells is in the visitor center. (Its twin is in the clock tower of the Student Memorial Center at the University of Arizona in Tucson.)\nThe shrine at the far end is a marble wall that bears the names of all those killed on Arizona, protected behind velvet ropes. To the left of the main wall is a small plaque which bears the names of thirty or so crew members who survived the 1941 sinking. Any surviving crew members of Arizona (or their families on their behalf) can have their ashes interred within the wreck by U.S. Navy divers\n\n\n=== History ===\n\nThe USS Arizona Memorial was formally dedicated on May 30, 1962 (Memorial Day) by Texas Congressman and Chairman of Veteran Affairs Olin E. Teague and future-Governor John A. Burns.\nIt was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on October 15, 1966. While the wreck of the Arizona was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1989, the memorial does not share this status. Rather, it is listed separately from the wreck on the National Register of Historic Places. The joint administration of the memorial by the United States Navy and the National Park Service was established on September 9, 1980.\nOil leaking from the sunken battleship can still be seen rising from the wreckage to the water's surface. This oil is sometimes referred to as \"the tears of the Arizona\" or \"black tears.\" In a National Geographic feature published in 2001, concerns were expressed that the continued deterioration of the Arizona's bulkheads and oil tanks from saltwater corrosion could pose a significant environmental threat from a rupture, resulting in a significant release of oil. The National Park Service states it has an ongoing program that closely monitors the submerged vessel's condition.\nThe Park Service, as part of its Centennial Initiative celebrating its 100th anniversary in 2016, developed a \"mobile park\" to tour the continental United States to increase exposure of the park. The mobile park also collected oral histories of the attack on Pearl Harbor.\n\n\n=== Maintenance ===\nThe marble wall is vulnerable to the presence of salt water vapor which causes stains and erosion damage to gradually appear. The original wall was replaced in 1984 and the first replacement wall was replaced in 2014.\n\n\n== USS Missouri ==\n\nUpon the deck of the battleship USS Missouri in Tokyo Bay, the Japanese surrendered to United States General Douglas MacArthur and Admiral Chester W. Nimitz, ending World War II. In 1999, Missouri was moved to Pearl Harbor from the United States west coast and docked behind, and in line, with USS Arizona, placing it perpendicular to the USS Arizona Memorial. The pairing of the two ships became an evocative symbol of the beginning and end of the United States' participation in the war.\nUSS Arizona Memorial staff initially criticized the placement of Missouri, saying the large battleship would \"overshadow\" the Arizona Memorial. To guard against this perception, Missouri was placed well back of the Arizona Memorial, and positioned in Pearl Harbor to prevent those participating in military ceremonies on Missouri's aft decks from seeing the Arizona Memorial. The decision to have Missouri's bow face the Memorial was intended to convey that Missouri now watches over the remains of Arizona so that those interred within Arizona's hull may rest in peace. These measures have helped preserve the identities of the Arizona Memorial and the Missouri Memorial, thereby improving the public's perception of having Arizona and Missouri in the same harbor.\n\n\n== Visiting the memorial ==\n\nThe visitor center operated by the National Park Service is free to the public and has a museum with exhibits about the Pearl Harbor attack, such as the ship's bell from Arizona.\nMore than one million people visit the memorial each year. Access to the USS Arizona Memorial is by U.S. Navy boat, for which an online reservation is required (in-person reservations were discontinued in February 2021, due to the COVID-19 pandemic). Because of the large number of visitors and the limited number of boat departures, most the reservations available each day are often fully allocated weeks in advance, although a limited number are held back for release the day before. Before boarding the boat for the short trip to the Memorial, visitors view a 23-minute documentary film depicting the attack on Pearl Harbor. Touring of the Memorial is self-guided. The National Park Service Web site provides visitor information, including hours of operation and ticketing advisories.\n\nA one-hour audio tour of the Memorial and Center exhibits, narrated by actress Jamie Lee Curtis, whose father, Tony Curtis was a World War II and Navy veteran, is available for rent at the visitor center. On the center's grounds along the shoreline are more exhibits and a \"Remembrance Circle\". Nearby is USS Bowfin, a World War II diesel submarine, which may be toured with separate, paid admission. The battleship USS Missouri and the Pacific Aviation Museum Pearl Harbor may also be visited, but require a bus ride to Ford Island.\nOn May 6, 2018, boat transportation to the memorial was suspended after one of the vessel operators noticed a crack on its outside. Although repairs were made, the cracks reappeared. The memorial was closed on May 26, 2018, and remained closed until September 1, 2019, but boat tours around the memorial and the other ships on Battleship Row continued to be made. The memorial briefly closed again in September and December of 2021 due to safety issues with the dock.\n\n\n== Honors ==\n\nEvery United States Navy, Coast Guard, and Merchant Marine vessel entering Pearl Harbor participates in the tradition of \"manning the rails.\" Personnel serving on these ships stand at attention at the ship's guard rails and salute the USS Arizona Memorial in solemn fashion as their ship slowly glides into port.\n\nArizona is no longer in commission, but is an active U.S. military cemetery. As survivors of the attack on Arizona die, many choose either to have their ashes scattered in the water over the ship, or to have their urns placed within the well of the barbette of Turret No. 4.  As a special tribute to the ship and her lost crew, the United States flag flies from the flagpole, which is attached to the severed mainmast of the sunken battleship.\nThe USS Arizona National Memorial was one of the nine major historical sites incorporated into the wide-ranging World War II Valor in the Pacific National Monument, established by Congress in 2008 and dedicated on December 7, 2010. The John D. Dingell, Jr. Conservation, Management, and Recreation Act divided the monument by the three states in which it was located, naming the Hawaii site as Pearl Harbor National Memorial.\nSince it was formally dedicated in 1962, every U.S. President has made a pilgrimage to the memorial, presenting a wreath and scattering flowers over Arizona in honor of the Americans who perished there. On December 27, 2016, Japanese Prime Minister Shinz\u014d Abe visited the memorial with President Barack Obama and paid respects to fallen service members there. Abe is the first Prime Minister of Japan to visit the USS Arizona memorial, 75 years after the Japanese attack. The visit was hailed by President Obama as \"a historic gesture of reconciliation.\"\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nUSS Arizona salvaged artifacts\nUSS Utah (BB-31) wreck of ship lost at Pearl Harbor and memorial\nU.S. Navy memorials\nU.S. Navy museums (and battleship museums)\nUniversity of Arizona \u2013 Student Union Memorial Center\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nInteractive USS Arizona Memorial, search the memorial for names\nUSS Arizona Memorial Museum Association\nBattleship Missouri Memorial\nPacific Aviation Museum Pearl Harbor\n\"Remembering Pearl Harbor:The USS Arizona Memorial\", a National Park Service Teaching with Historic Places (TwHP) lesson plan\nHigh resolution, zoomable panorama taken inside the Arizona Memorial\nA Memorial Day to Remember\nHistoric American Engineering Record (HAER) No. HI-13, \"USS Arizona, Submerged off Ford Island, Pearl Harbor, Honolulu, Honolulu County, HI\"", "infobox": {"name": "USS ''Arizona'' Memorial", "photo": "USS_Arizona_Memorial_(aerial_view).jpg", "photo_caption": "USS ''Arizona'' Memorial", "location": "[[Pearl Harbor]]", "nearest_city": "[[Honolulu, Hawaii]]", "coordinates": "{{coords|21|21|54|N|157|57|0|W|type:landmark_scale:1500|display|=|inline, title}}", "map": "Hawaii", "area_acre": "10.50", "established": "May 30, 1962", "visitation_num": "1,556,808", "visitation_year": "2005", "governing_body": "[[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]]<br />[[National Park Service]]", "website": "[https://www.nps.gov/valr/ Pearl Harbor National Memorial]"}, "wikidata": {"NRHP reference number (P649)": "66000944", "Commons category (P373)": "USS Arizona Memorial", "instance of (P31)": ["military museum (Q2772772)", "National Memorial of the United States (Q1967454)", "shipwreck (Q852190)"], "coordinate location (P625)": {"latitude": 21.3649, "longitude": -157.95, "altitude": null, "precision": -0.001, "globe": "http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q2"}, "Freebase ID (P646)": "/m/0345lz", "heritage designation (P1435)": "National Register of Historic Places listed place (Q19558910)", "official website (P856)": "http://www.nps.gov/usar/", "Commons gallery (P935)": "USS Arizona Memorial", "located in the administrative territorial entity (P131)": "Honolulu County (Q487704)", "inception (P571)": "+1962-05-30T00:00:00Z", "image (P18)": "USS Arizona Memorial (aerial view).jpg", "native label (P1705)": "USS Arizona Memorial", "architect (P84)": "Alfred Preis (Q4723315)", "Park Alpha Code (P4083)": "USAR", "U.S. National Archives Identifier (P1225)": "10666418", "area (P2046)": {"amount": "+425", "unit": "http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q712226"}, "GeoNames ID (P1566)": "5853844", "date of official opening (P1619)": "+1962-05-30T00:00:00Z", "topic's main category (P910)": "Category:USS Arizona Memorial (Q55275339)", "Wolfram Language entity code (P4839)": "Entity[\"Park\", \"USSArizonaMemorial::zsr5m\"]", "Library of Congress authority ID (P244)": "sh86005034", "operator (P137)": "National Park Service (Q308439)", "located in protected area (P3018)": "Pearl Harbor National Memorial (Q64396787)", "significant place (P7153)": "Honolulu (Q18094)", "French Vikidia ID (P7818)": "M\u00e9morial_de_l'USS_Arizona", "location (P276)": "Pearl Harbour (Q127091)", "country of registry (P8047)": "United States of America (Q30)", "country (P17)": "United States of America (Q30)", "LoC HABS/HAER/HALS place ID (P8655)": "hi0096", "National Library of Israel J9U ID (P8189)": "987007560797605171"}, "cat": "Monuments_and_memorials", "url": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Arizona_Memorial", "wikibase": "Q2004262"}, {"name": "Mount Soledad", "url_name": "1132773", "txt": "Mount Soledad, also known as Soledad Mountain, is a prominent landmark in the city of San Diego, California, United States. The mountaintop is the site of the Mount Soledad Cross, the subject of a 25-year controversy over the involvement of religion in government which concluded in 2016.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nThe 823-foot (251 m) mountain lies between Interstate 5 to the east and the Pacific Ocean to the west. It is mostly within the community of La Jolla where the northern and eastern slopes form a sharp escarpment along the Rose Canyon fault. The community of Pacific Beach is on the gentler southern slope. There are several radio and television transmitters located on the summit including KFMB-TV and KGTV, the CBS and ABC affiliates respectively. Commercial aircraft approaching San Diego from the direction of Los Angeles often use Mount Soledad as their point to start the downwind leg of their approach to San Diego International Airport.\n\n\n== Land events ==\nOn October 3, 2007, one home on Soledad Mountain Road and one of the main roads up the mountain was destroyed by a major landslide.  Five houses were damaged, and over 20 others were evacuated.  The city of San Diego had noticed water and gas main leaks since July, and cracks in the pavement since August 2007.\n\n\n== Legend of Munchkin land ==\nThere is an urban legend that in the 1930s, a group of little people who appeared in Hollywood films such as The Wizard of Oz, came to San Diego, where they built miniature houses on Mount Soledad.The legend gained traction due to the fact several houses were built on steep slopes overlooking the Pacific. As passing observers looked down, the perspective made doors and other features appear smaller than normal. Most of the supposed \"Munchkin Houses\" have been remodeled and the effect is no longer present.\n\n\n== Last home of Dr. Seuss ==\nMount Soledad is the location of the last home lived in by Dr. Seuss. His widow, Audrey Geisel, resided atop Mount Soledad in a lavish home, which includes an observation tower referred to as the Seuss house by the locals, until her death in 2018.\n\n\n== Cycling ==\nBecause of the variety of long steady climbs, light traffic on most routes, and great views, Mount Soledad is a popular cycling destination and area.  There are numerous routes ranging from the relatively gradual, 3.5-mile (5.6 km) climb up Soledad Mountain Road on the southern slopes to the very steep and short, 1.25-mile (2.0 km), Hidden Valley Road to Via Capri route on the north side.\n\n\n== Mount Soledad Cross ==\n\nMount Soledad is topped by a large concrete Christian cross, first built in 1913, and since rebuilt twice. The third and current version was dedicated in 1954 as the Mount Soledad Easter Cross; the word \"Easter\" was dropped in the 1980s. After the cross was challenged in court during the late 1980s, it was designated a Korean War memorial. It became the center of a controversy over the display of religious symbols on government property.It was ruled unconstitutional by the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in January 2011.On June 25, 2012, the United States Supreme Court denied certiorari, allowing the order of the Ninth Circuit to stand.In July 2015, a group called the Mt. Soledad Memorial Association reported that it had bought the half-acre of land under the cross from the Department of Defense for $1.4 million. On September 7, 2016 the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit issued a one-page ruling, ordering dismissal of the case and an end to all current appeals, stating that the case was now moot because the cross was no longer on government land. Both sides agreed that this decision puts a final end to the case.\n\n\n== See also ==\nSan Diego Historical Landmarks in La Jolla, California\n\n\n== References ==", "infobox": {"name": "Mount Soledad", "photo": "Soledad from Torrey Pines.jpg", "photo_size": "285", "photo_alt": "Finger of a mountain visible behind a cliff and on a beach with a partly cloudy sky", "photo_caption": "Mount Soledad seen from the north in [[Torrey Pines State Reserve]], [[La Jolla]], [[San Diego]], [[California]]", "elevation_ft": "823", "elevation_ref": "{{NAVD88}}", "prominence_ft": "472", "location": "[[La Jolla, California|La Jolla]], [[San Diego County, California|San Diego, County]], [[California]], [[United States|U.S.]]", "map": "United States San Diego Northwestern", "map_alt": "Location within Northwestern San Diego", "map_caption": "Location within Northwestern San Diego", "map_size": "250", "label": "Mount Soledad", "label_position": "bottom", "coordinates": "{{coord|32.839866731|N|117.252491236|W|type:mountain_region:US-CA_scale:100000_source:ngs|format|=|dms|display|=|inline,title}}", "topo": "[[United States Geological Survey|USGS]] La Jolla"}, "wikidata": {"instance of (P31)": ["mountain (Q8502)", "tourist attraction (Q570116)"], "coordinate location (P625)": {"latitude": 32.839722222222, "longitude": -117.25222222222, "altitude": null, "precision": 0.00027777777777778, "globe": "http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q2"}, "country (P17)": "United States of America (Q30)", "located in the administrative territorial entity (P131)": "San Diego County (Q108143)", "image (P18)": "Mount Soledad from anwhere.jpg", "elevation above sea level (P2044)": {"amount": "+824", "unit": "http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q3710"}, "topographic prominence (P2660)": {"amount": "+472", "unit": "http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q3710", "upperBound": "+472", "lowerBound": "+472"}, "GNIS ID (P590)": "1661465", "Peakbagger mountain ID (P3109)": "21350", "Getty Thesaurus of Geographic Names ID (P1667)": "2675459", "LoJ peak ID (P3907)": "70541", "Commons category (P373)": "Mount Soledad", "GeoNames ID (P1566)": "5397026", "category for the view from the item (P8933)": "Category:Views from Mount Soledad (Q104235943)", "Freebase ID (P646)": "/m/0492k3"}, "cat": "Monuments_and_memorials", "url": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Soledad", "wikibase": "Q337916"}, {"name": "Abdel Khaliq Mahjub", "url_name": "12170071", "txt": "Abdel Khaliq Mahjub (Arabic: \u0639\u0628\u062f \u0627\u0644\u062e\u0627\u0644\u0642 \u0645\u062d\u062c\u0648\u0628) (23 September 1927 \u2013 28 July 1971) was a Sudanese politician.\nMahjub was born in Omdurman.  He was the Secretary General of the Sudanese Communist Party till his death by execution in Khartum during the Gaafar Nimeiry regime. Following his execution Muhammad Ibrahim Nugud became the leader of the party.\n\n\n== Views ==\nMahjub was introduced to communist ideas while studying at Fuad I University in Egypt, from which he was expelled in 1948 for political activities. He became Secretary General of the Sudanese Communist Party in February 1949. He was influential in international communist forums. A number of his writings focused on the idea of finding a more Nationalist formula for Marxism in Sudan, rather than the literal application of the experience of the Soviets or the Chinese. These writings helped exacerbate the Soviet-Sino split. He also rejected subordination to the Soviet Communist Party, and in contrast to a large number of other communist parties, supported freedom of religion instead of State atheism. He was arrested by the dictatorship of Ibrahim Abboud in 1959 and his trial speech in his own defence, \"By Virtue of Marxism Your Honour\", was an assertive and clearly-stated political testament. and under Mahjoub\u2019s leadership, the Communist Party played an important role in overthrowing Abboud in 1964.Mahjub opposed the 1969 coup by Jaafar Nimeiri as he saw it as incompatible with the principle of democracy, which was advocated by the party, but he could not secure the approval of a majority of secretaries of the CPC Central which was required to condemn the coup.

Nimeiry subsequently ordered the execution of a large number of SCP party leaders.\nMahjub initially refused to flee the country, despite an offer of sanctuary from the East German Embassy, stating that his basic duty was to spread awareness among the masses and the establishment of democracy in Sudan, neither of which he would be able to achieve from exile.

Oropeza, who died in 2010 at age 53, was the first Latina to serve on the Long Beach USD school board and the city council.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External Links ==\nJenny Oropeza at Find a Grave\nJoin California Jenny Oropeza\nJenny Oropeza at Ballotpedia", "infobox": {"name": "Jenny Oropeza", "image": "CA State Senator Jenny Oropeza.jpg", "caption": "Oropeza at the [[California State Capitol]] in 2010", "state_senate": "California State", "district": "[[California's 28th State Senate district|28th]]", "term_start": "December 4, 2006", "term_end": "October 20, 2010", "predecessor": "[[Debra Bowen]]", "successor": "[[Ted Lieu]]", "state_assembly2": "California", "district2": "[[California's 55th State Assembly district|55th]]", "term_start2": "December 4, 2000", "term_end2": "November 30, 2006", "predecessor2": "[[Richard Floyd (California politician)|Richard Floyd]]", "successor2": "[[Laura Richardson]]", "office3": "Member of the [[Long Beach, California|Long Beach]] City Council<br />from the 1st district", "term_start3": "July 15, 1994", "term_end3": "December 4, 2000", "predecessor3": "Evan Anderson Braude", "successor3": "[[Bonnie Lowenthal]]", "birth_name": "Jennifer Ann Oropeza", "birth_date": "{{Birth date|1957|09|27}}", "birth_place": "[[Montebello, California]], U.S.", "death_date": "{{Death date and age|2010|10|20|1957|09|27}}", "death_place": "[[Long Beach, California]], U.S.", "death_cause": "[[Cancer]]", "resting_place": "[[Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery]], [[Cypress, California]], U.S.", "party": "[[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]]", "spouse": "{{marriage|Thomas Mullins|1977}}", "relatives": "Lynne Oropeza (sister)", "alma_mater": "[[California State University, Long Beach]] (B.A. Business Administration)", "occupation": "[[Legislator]]", "known_for": "[[Environmentalism]], [[Public health|Public Health]], [[Education policy]], [[Alameda Corridor]]", "committees": "'''Senate Chair'''<br>Revenue and Taxation<br>Integrity of Elections<br>Public Health and the Environment<br>CA Latino Caucus on Environmental Justice Policy<br>'''Assembly Chair'''<br>Budget<br>Transportation"}, "wikidata": {"sex or gender (P21)": "female (Q6581072)", "country of citizenship (P27)": "United States of America (Q30)", "date of birth (P569)": "+1957-09-27T00:00:00Z", "date of death (P570)": "+2010-10-20T00:00:00Z", "instance of (P31)": "human (Q5)", "position held (P39)": ["member of the California State Assembly (Q18180908)", "member of the State Senate of California (Q19690441)"], "given name (P735)": "Jenny (Q3807899)", "occupation (P106)": "politician (Q82955)", "member of political party (P102)": "Democratic Party (Q29552)", "languages spoken, written or signed (P1412)": "English (Q1860)", "work location (P937)": "Sacramento (Q18013)", "name in native language (P1559)": "Jenny Oropeza", "Freebase ID (P646)": "/m/02vywk_", "place of birth (P19)": "Montebello (Q664503)", "manner of death (P1196)": "natural causes (Q3739104)", "educated at (P69)": ["California State University, Long Beach (Q1026926)", "Alhambra High School (Q19871954)"], "family name (P734)": "Oropeza (Q16880796)", "place of death (P20)": "Long Beach (Q16739)", "image (P18)": "Jenny Oropeza (142821897).jpg", "cause of death (P509)": "liver cancer (Q623031)", "Commons category (P373)": "Jenny Oropeza", "Prabook ID (P3368)": "325942", "Find a Grave memorial ID (P535)": "60683616"}, "cat": "Politicians", "url": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jenny_Oropeza", "wikibase": "Q1687054"}, {"name": "Randy Hillier", "url_name": "12176586", "txt": "Randy Hillier (born 1958) is a Canadian politician who served as a member of provincial parliament (MPP) in the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 2007-2022. Hillier represented the riding of Lanark\u2014Frontenac\u2014Kingston as an independent MPP from 2019 to 2022. This riding contains much of the dissolved riding of Lanark\u2014Frontenac\u2014Lennox and Addington, which he represented from 2007 to 2018. Hillier was initially elected as a Progressive Conservative (PC) Party MPP, remaining a member until he was removed in 2019. Despite announcing that he would run for election under the banner of the Ontario First Party in November 2021, Hillier announced in March 2022 that he would not seek re-election.Hillier was a candidate in the 2009 PC leadership election and the interim leadership election in 2014. He has formerly served as the PC critic for the Attorney General, Labour, Northern Development, and Mines and Forestry in the legislature. Hillier was removed from the PC Party by Premier Doug Ford in 2019 after making disrespectful comments to parents of children with autism. He has been outspoken against the use of facemasks, vaccines, and lockdowns during the COVID-19 pandemic. He spent extensive time at the \"Freedom Convoy\" occupation, encouraging people to flood police phone lines during the clearance of protesters, and is currently on bail following nine charges related to his activity around the protest.He sat as an independent MPP until the dissolution of Parliament on May 3, 2022.\n\n\n== Background ==\nHillier was a licensed construction electrician (licence expired July 31, 2013) with a diploma in electrical engineering technology from Algonquin College and former employee of the Canadian federal government. He lives near Perth, Ontario.\n\n\n=== Property rights activism ===\nPrior to serving as an MPP, in 2003, Hillier co-founded and served as the first president of the Lanark Landowners' Association. He then assisted in creation of local landowner groups in other parts of Ontario, modelled on the Lanark Landowners. In 2006, he became the first president of the 15,000-member Ontario Landowners Association (OLA), an umbrella group for these groups. The OLA was formed \"...to preserve and protect the rights of property owners and to enshrine property rights within the Constitution of Canada and the laws of the Province of Ontario.\"Under Hillier's leadership, the landowners' groups initially engaged in acts of civil disobedience, including blocking highways, barricading government offices, staging illegal deer hunts, and publicly breaking laws that the landowners regarded as unjust.\nHillier has explained the illegal actions of the landowners as follows:\n\nI believe in non-violent civil disobedience. I believe when a law or rule is blatantly wrong it is a part of our democratic process to challenge that law. At times civil disobedience is used to illustrate and further bring attention to the absurdity.\nIn 2007, when he was seeking election to the provincial legislature, Hillier was challenged to justify his participation four years earlier in an illegal deer hunt. He responded by stating,\n\nI sent [Ontario Premier Dalton McGuinty an email containing] a picture of a dead deer saying the people of Lanark County were removing nuisance deer because the Liberal government had revoked those licences [for farmers to shoot deer that were eating their crops]. I did it four years ago... and I would do it again because I will not stand for injustice and I will not stand for farmers to be put into bankruptcy.\nAs well as acts of civil disobedience, the landowners conducted demonstrations at Queen's Park and Parliament Hill. Hillier's ability to attract media notice through the use of attention-grabbing rhetoric and tactics prompted one television commentator to describe him as \"Don Cherry in plaid and rubber boots.\" On one occasion in 2006, Hillier was arrested and detained (but not charged) for trespassing during a protest at a water quality meeting in Cornwall.After the creation of the OLA in 2006, acts of civil disobedience were replaced by attempts to influence the political system by more traditional means. Landowner-endorsed candidates ran for municipal office in many rural municipalities in the 2006 Ontario municipal elections. Hillier and other members of the OLA began to appear as witnesses before parliamentary hearings into issues affecting rural areas.Hillier resigned as president of the OLA in 2007 in order to run for a seat in the provincial legislature.\n\n\n==== Perspective as an MPP ====\nHillier was elected to the provincial legislature in 2007. In October 2014, Hillier referred to members of the Lanark Landowners' Association as \"nutbars,\" claiming \"[w]hen I was there I tried to keep a distance from the fringe elements and the nutbars, if I can put it that way.\" The practice adopted by Landowners Associations of seeking original Crown patents for their land \"has been, quite frankly, a problem for me as an MPP,\" Hillier said. \"People are following this advice and not getting building permits, and then when the building inspectors visit them they\u2019re phoning me as their MPP and seeking my assistance.\"\n\n\n=== Editorialist ===\nHillier is the author of numerous editorials on a wide range of policy issues. Between 2003 and 2010, he contributed 11 articles to Le Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois Libre, a bilingual libertarian online journal that was published in Montreal until 2010.Beginning in 2006, Hillier was co-publisher and co-editor of the OLA's official organ, The Landowner magazine (known since September 2019 as Landowner Voices) which is published bi-monthly. Hillier used to publish an editorial in each issue of The Landowner.\n\n\n== Political career ==\n\n\n=== 2007 election campaign ===\nIn January 2007, Hillier resigned as president of the OLA to seek the Progressive Conservative nomination in Lanark\u2014Frontenac\u2014Lennox and Addington in the upcoming provincial election. Some members of the party suggested that Hillier's activist past made him an unsuitable candidate, and the Toronto Star speculated that the party might disqualify him. Scott Reid, the federal MP for Lanark-Frontenac-Lennox and Addington, responded that he would be \"very disappointed\" if Hillier were prevented from running, adding \"I can't think of anything more dangerous to our prospects [of winning in this riding]\". On May 5, Hillier won a three-way nomination against Jay Brennan and Brent Cameron. He was elected MPP for the riding on October 10, 2007, capturing 40.58 per cent of the vote and defeating Liberal candidate Ian Wilson by 820 votes.During the election campaign, some observers questioned Hillier's fitness for elected office, given his history of civil disobedience. But this history won him some admirers as well. Similarly, his willingness to take contrarian positions (for example, announcing his denial of climate change at a mid-election meeting of the editorial board of the Ottawa Citizen) earned him approval as well as opposition. Shortly after this meeting, the Citizen's editorial board endorsed Hillier. An editorial in the paper advised voters to \"[t]ake a chance on Randy Hillier\" and stated that \"the landowners'-rights activist is doing the right thing by running for the legislature and trying to change the system he's been battling for so very long.\"\n\n\n=== 2007\u20132009: Early career as a Member of Provincial Parliament ===\nFollowing the 2007 election, Hillier was appointed his party's critic for rural affairs.\nHowever, it became increasingly clear that Hillier was unhappy with the leadership of PC leader John Tory. In March 2008 an article in the Ottawa Citizen reported that Hillier was considering leaving the Progressive Conservative caucus and joining the small Reform Party of Ontario. Hillier brushed aside this rumour as \"void of fact.\"\n\n\n=== 2009: Ontario PC leadership candidate ===\nIn early March 2009, John Tory resigned as leader of the Ontario PCs. On March 30, Hillier announced his candidacy in the leadership race to succeed Tory. Few observers thought Hillier had a realistic chance of winning, but some media commentators speculated that he might fill the role of kingmaker.Lacking in high-profile endorsements, Hillier instead focused his leadership bid on a series of policy announcements. These included: \n\nAllowing Ontarians to vote to elect their senators;\nEnacting a law, which he proposed to call the Freedom of Association and Conscience Act, which would allow health care professionals and other government-paid individuals to refuse to provide services to which, for religious or moral reasons, they were personally opposed (such as doctors and nurses refusing to perform abortions and marriage commissioners refusing to perform same-sex marriages);\nAbolishing the Ontario Human Rights Commission and allowing all legal proceedings under the province's Human Rights Code to be dealt with in the regular court system.\nAllowing the sale of beer and wine in corner stores;\nRestoration of the spring bear hunt;\nEnding the closed shop in unionized workplaces;\nReverse the ban on the cosmetic use of pesticides;\nabolition of the province's property tax assessment agency (MPAC);\nIncreasing the speed limit on Ontario highways;\nAllowing the de-amalgamation of municipalities which had been forcibly amalgamated in the 1990s;\nCracking down on the aboriginal occupations in places like Caledonia.Hillier placed fourth in the September 2009 leadership vote, with just under 10 per cent of the vote. However, the initial vote-count showed no clear leader among the other three candidates: Tim Hudak had won 33.9 per cent, Frank Klees had 29.9 per cent, and Christine Elliott had 26.4 per cent. Because the election was structured as a preferential vote, the ballots cast by Hillier supporters were then redistributed among the other candidates. This system meant that Hillier's prior public endorsement of Tim Hudak as his own second choice for leader was important: two-thirds of the second-preference votes of Hillier supporters went to Hudak, doubling his lead over Klees.\n\n\n=== 2009\u2013present: Political career after the leadership election ===\nFollowing the election, Tim Hudak appointed Hillier as the party's critic for Labour, and for Northern Development, Mines and Forestry in the provincial legislature.\nRegarding Hillier's support of Jack MacLaren, former Ontario Landowners Association President, to challenge sitting MPP Norm Sterling at the Annual General Meeting of the Carleton-Mississippi Mills Ontario Progressive Conservative Party Riding Association, the Globe and Mail described Hillier as a \"shrewd political operator\"Prior to the 2011 provincial election, Randy Hillier and federal counterpart Scott Reid introduced motions to the Legislative Assembly of Ontario and the federal House of Commons, respectively, to enshrine property rights for Ontarians in the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.\n\n\n==== 2011 election ====\nDuring the 2011 provincial election, it was reported that, as the result of a dispute over with the agency over taxes said to be owing for the sale of some land, the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) had placed two liens with a total value of $15,000 on property owned by Hillier and his wife. Hillier responded that they were working with CRA to resolve the dispute. The dispute did not hurt Hillier's reelection effort; he won by a 10,000 vote margin.\n\n\n==== 2012 ====\nAfter the 2011 provincial election, Randy Hillier co-sponsored a bill to repeal Ontario's breed-specific restrictions on pit bull ownership. The bill was supported by members of all three parties at second reading in February 2012. Despite passing second reading and committee, Ontario's Liberal Government did not call the Bill for third reading. It died on the order table with Premier McGuinty's prorogation of the legislature.\nFollowing revelations in January 2012 that the head of a union local in Toronto was rehired after improperly spending public funds, Hillier called on the Ontario Government to make unions receiving public money to be made more accountable.In March 2012, Hillier introduced a bill to proclaim \"Constitution Day\", recognizing the day that the British North America Act and the Constitution Act were proclaimed into law.With the support of the Canadian Taxpayers Federation, Hillier introduced a bill to strengthen the Taxpayer Protection Act introduced by the Harris government and to require all pieces of legislation be costed before they are introduced to the Ontario Legislature.\n\n\n==== 2013 ====\nIn September 2013, Hillier was stripped of his role as the party's labour critic after the Toronto Star published an email Hillier had sent to the PC caucus raising concerns over colleague Monte McNaughton's private member's bill abrogating construction company EllisDon's 1950s-era collective bargaining agreement. The Star revealed that Hillier's concerns included that the PC Party would receive donations from Ellis Don for pushing the legislation. Hillier acknowledged that the email was his but did not comment on it.  Hillier voted against the bill at second reading along with the members of the New Democratic caucus. Hudak, McNaughton and nine other members of the Tory caucus and 22 Liberals voted for the bill at second reading. All but two Liberals voted against the Bill at third reading. Hillier was not in attendance for the third reading vote.At the end of October 2013, Hillier introduced a bill to allow provincial politicians to be recalled from public office. Hillier's bill received some public support after he recommended that it should apply to Toronto mayor Rob Ford, who was embroiled in a crack cocaine scandal.In the fall of 2013 Hillier wrote an article for the Canadian Parliamentary Review detailing his ideas to reform Ontario's Legislature to \"empower\" Members of Provincial Parliament.\n\n\n==== Interim leadership bid ====\nHillier stood for the position of interim leader of the party following Tim Hudak's resignation in the aftermath of the 2014 provincial election. Hillier advocated moving power out of the hands of the leader and having more decisions made by caucus, including the selection of House Leader and Whip. He was defeated by Jim Wilson. Prior to the caucus meeting where the vote for interim leader was held, Wilson had dismissed Hillier's bid as a stunt, saying \"He\u2019s crazy... he has consistently betrayed the trust of caucus.\"\n\n\n==== 2018 ====\nIn February 2018 Hillier filed a formal complaint against former Ontario PC Leader and MPP Patrick Brown during the leadership race. \"I've known Patrick Brown to lie just about every time he opens his mouth\"  Hillier told reporters, he \"engaged in dirty and crooked politics\".  \"He purposely and willfully lied to the people of Ontario.\"  An investigation found no evidence to support Hillier's allegations that Brown failed to disclose gifts of travel. Brown publicly responded calling Hillier's allegations \"garbage,\" and \"fabricated\".\n\n\n==== 2019 ====\nHillier was suspended from the PC caucus by Premier Doug Ford on February 20, 2019 after making what Ford characterized as \"disrespectful comments to parents of children with autism.\" Hillier denied the allegation, and said he was ousted for other reasons. A letter sent by the PC Party President was released blaming him for a lack of commitment to the caucus. He was subsequently removed from the PC caucus on March 15, 2019.\n\n\n=== 2020\u2013present: opponent of COVID-19 measures and laws ===\nAt the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, Hillier was sitting as an independent MPP after being removed from the PC caucus in 2019. He has been skeptical of the pandemic and has been a vocal proponent of ending the emergency measures put in place by the Ontario government, such as lockdowns, stay-at-home orders, and advice regarding social distancing and use of face masks. \nIn June 2020, he took part in a rally protesting the COVID-19 lockdown in Ontario at Queen's Park, and was later condemned by Premier Doug Ford who described Hillier's participation in the rally as \"totally irresponsible\" and said it goes against \"what everybody has been working for.\"In October 2020, Kingston public health officials sent a letter to Hillier expressing concerns regarding his spreading of misinformation about the pandemic. Hillier refused to say whether he thought the pandemic was real, said he was anti-mask and likened the pandemic to a bad flu season. He had also asserted on Twitter that public health officials were guilty of crimes against humanity.On 26 November 2020, Hillier organized an anti-COVID-19 lockdown rally at Queen's Park. Unlike the first such rally that Hillier organized (on October 21), this rally led to Hillier being issued a court summons by police, for violating the lockdown restrictions in place in Toronto at the time, which limited outdoor gatherings to 10 people. His court date was set for January 7, 2021.On 29 December 2020, Hillier tweeted a Christmas photo of a gathering at his home with 15 people from multiple households. At the time, Ontario was in a province-wide lockdown and the number of people allowed to gather indoors had been restricted to only members of a family living in the same household.On 24 January 2021, Hiller attended an in-person service at a Waterloo, Ontario church, during a time when such services were prohibited by provincial law due to the pandemic.On 25 February 2021, Hillier tweeted that \"there is no (COVID-19) pandemic & never was, we were duped\", and in a separate tweet urged his followers that \"we must start shaming those who wear a mask, as they shame others, the masks are coercing us to live their lie.\" Hillier was blocked from Twitter for 24 hours for violating its terms of service, and when he returned he blamed \"trolls and bots\" for his temporary ban.On 1 April 2021, Hillier tweeted an image of Adolf Hitler with a caption that read \"The Third ....wave. Everyone who has ever been to the sea, knows there is no end to waves. Its only 28 days this time. Truth does not mind being questioned. Lies do not like to be challenged. #onpoli #WeAreLivingaLie #nomorelockdowns\", drawing a comparison between Ontario's COVID-19 lockdowns (a 28-day province-wide lockdown had been announced to begin on April 3, 2021, to combat the so-called \"third wave\" of the province's pandemic) and the fascist government of Nazi Germany under Hitler. Hillier's tweet coincided with the Jewish holiday Passover, and the Centre for Israel and Jewish Affairs, a Canadian Jewish advocacy group, criticized Hillier's insensitivity and drawing of \"false equivalencies\" between lockdown measures and the Holocaust. He was also condemned by Kingston and the Islands MPP Ian Arthur and MP Mark Gerretsen, the latter calling for Hillier's removal from office.On 8 April 2021, Hillier was billed as the special guest speaker at a \"Mask Burning\" event at the South Branch Bistro, Kemptville, Ontario, organized by No More Lock Downs Canada.On 25 April 2021, Hillier attended a church service in Aylmer, Ontario at Church of God Restoration. Hillier, along with Hastings\u2014Lennox and Addington MP Derek Sloan (who had also been expelled from his own Conservative caucus after receiving a donation from a white supremacist) attended the event without wearing face masks or maintaining physical distancing, as shown in a video of the event. Four individuals were charged with violating the Reopening Ontario Act, including two that fit the description of Hillier and Sloan. Those charged have been summoned to court, with scheduled appearances in June.The local governments of several municipalities within Hillier's riding have passed motions condemning Hillier and asking the provincial government to sanction him in any way possible. Motions to this effect have been passed in South Frontenac, Central Frontenac, Perth, Smiths Falls, Carleton Place, and the Kingston, with the latter city council's motion calling for an investigation from the Ontario Integrity Commissioner.As of May 5, 2021, Hillier has been charged eight times for his defiance of the Reopening Ontario Act, including for hosting an anti-lockdown protest and march in Belleville on April 16. According to a Facebook post, Hillier plans to fight all charges.In October 2021, families of several people in Ontario accused Hillier of spreading fake news and unauthorized use of their relatives photos and personal details to promote his anti-vaccination views. Hillier tweeted the images of 11 deceased people, suggesting they died or suffered from a \"permanent adverse reaction shortly after receiving their first or second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine,\" contrary to what their obituaries and relatives said. On October 28, the Ontario legislature unanimously condemned and called for a publicly apology for Hillier's \"disreputable conduct\", in particular the post misrepresenting several people's deaths. As of that time, Hillier had violated the legislature's rules regarding the use of face masks four times.On November 15, Hillier falsely claimed on his Facebook page that Public Health Ontario (PHO) had undertaken investigations into \"37 possible deaths\" caused by COVID-19 vaccines, according to a 2021 Global News article on the role of COVID-19 misinformation has contributed to \"radicalizing Canadians\".Hillier went camping with people who displayed a Diagolon flag; Diagolon is a Canadian-founded neo-fascist group linked to the convoy protests.\n\n\n==== Freedom Convoy protests ====\nDuring the Canada convoy protests' occupation of Ottawa in January and February 2022, Hillier claims to have spent much of three weeks among the protesters.On January 25, Hillier posted a tweet that referred to federal Minister of Transportation Omar Alghabra as a \"terrorist.\" In a separate tweet, Hillier called on the RCMP to open an investigation into Justin Trudeau, whom he accused of an \"act of domestic terrorism\" by depriving Canadians of food and essentials in the winter (a reference to perceived supply chain issues caused by the vaccine mandate for cross-border truckers, an inciting reason for the convoy protest). Public Safety Minister Marco Mendicino urged Twitter to remove the post that referred to Alghabra, as Islamophobic hate speech. The provincial Liberal and New Democratic Party leaders called for increased sanctions against Hillier, beyond the \"disreputable conduct\" mechanism previously used.Hillier called for \"dialogue\" with the protesters, on February 8. and attended a press conference on February 9, reiterating his support for the convoy.On Twitter, Hillier claimed that protesters would leave Ottawa shortly after a press conference to be held at 1:00 PM on February 19. He claims that police blocked him from attending the conference. He urged supporters to \"keep calling\" and jam the phone lines of the Ottawa Police. It was compared it to the \"counselling to commit mischief\" charge applied to protest leaders like Tamara Lich, suggesting Hillier should be jailed.On February 22, the Legislative Assembly of Ontario unanimously passed a motion that authorized the Speaker to not recognize him in the legislature until he publishes written apologies for his actions and the Speaker is satisfied of their sincerity. The motion stated that \"this House expresses its disapproval of, and dissociates itself from, continued disreputable conduct by the Member for Lanark-Frontenac-Kingston, most specifically his use of social media to make racist and discriminatory statements about a federal cabinet minister and for publishing social media posts insinuating a call to violence.\"On March 28, Hillier turned himself in to the Ottawa Police, while facing nine charges against him due to his actions at the protest: one count of assaulting a peace or public officer (allegedly checking an officer with his shoulder and hip), two counts of obstructing or resisting a public officer, one count of obstructing or resisting someone aiding a public or peace officer, three counts of counselling an uncommitted indictable offence, two of them considered mischief, and two counts of mischief or obstructing property exceeding $5,000. He was granted bail and released later that day, on the conditions that he would avoid the general area of downtown Ottawa, not associate with any of the protest organizers, and refrain from posting on social media about the convoy and anti-vaccine or mask mandates. The justice of the peace at his bail hearing noted that his social media activity \"poses a substantial risk.\"\n\n\n=== 2022 general election ===\nIn November 2021, Hillier announced his intention to run for reelection under the banner of the People's Party of Canada's Ontario wing. Hillier launched the Ontario First Party (OFP) on December 4, 2021 as an unregistered provincial political party. The party began a registration process with Elections Ontario on December 17, 2021, with Paul Maletta requesting the registration. While the party name was approved on January 19, 2022, it remains an unregistered party. There were also plans to run candidates in the 2022 Ontario general election, though none were ultimately confirmed.\nInitially, there were attempts by the federal People's Party of Canada (PPC) to register the name \"People's Party of Ontario\" with Elections Ontario. The elections agency rejected the name five times due to its similarity to the existing Peoples Political Party, which has been registered since 2011 by perennial candidate Kevin Clarke. In March 2021, the PPC and Clarke discussed Clarke relinquishing his rights to the name in exchange for running under the PPC banner. The discussions, while initially productive, later broke down after Clarke posted about the matter on social media and added other people to his email conversations with the PPC.On March 3, 2022, Hillier announced by a video posted on social media that he had decided not to run for re-election in the 2022 provincial election, saying \"our political system is broken... there is no sense spending any more time trying to fix a broken system from within when the problem lies without.\" This would have been his first attempt at running against a Progressive Conservative, instead of running as a PC candidate. The website and social media for the Ontario First Party were shut down.\nThe Populist Party Ontario (PPO) was announced as an unregistered provincial political party upon the closure of the Ontario First Party (OFP). The party began a registration process with Elections Ontario on December 17, 2021, with Shelley Batcules requesting the registration. The party name was approved on January 24, 2022. The OFP website currently redirects to the Populist Party Ontario website, where a few references to the OFP remain. Hillier has not endorsed the PPO.\n\n\n== Other controversies ==\nIn 2017 allegations were made against Hillier for violating the internal conduct policies of Tay Valley Township and the Occupational Health and Safety Act. Following a three-month investigation Hillier was found to have harassed municipal staff in Tay Valley. The township investigation wrote that Hillier \"unfairly called into question the competence and proficiency of Township staff and undermined their integrity.\" A letter from the township Chief Administrative Officer said there was a pattern of criticism and that the MPP had been \"cautioned\" about this \"type of behaviour\" in March. The letter stated, \"Much of the information upon which you rely for your criticisms is inaccurate and the commentary about staff is disparaging.

He was elected as a Plaid Cymru MP, but had the whip withdrawn in May 2020 after he was arrested on suspicion of assault. He currently sits as an Independent MP after the party's disciplinary panel suspended him from the party.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nDavid Jonathan Edwards was born in Carmarthenshire on 26 April 1976. He was educated at Ysgol Maes yr Yrfa before studying history and politics at the University of Wales, Aberystwyth. He went on to complete a postgraduate degree in international history.He worked as a staff member for Rhodri Glyn Thomas and Adam Price before working for Plaid Cymru from 2005 to 2007. He worked at Citizens Advice Cymru from 2007 to 2010.\n\n\n== Political career ==\nThe MP for Carmarthen East and Dinefwr, Adam Price, stood down in the 2010 general election. Edwards was the new candidate for Plaid Cymru, and he was elected with 35.6% of the vote. In January 2012, Edwards submitted an early day motion for a Cornish Assembly, being supported by fellow Plaid Cymru MPs Hywel Williams and Elfyn Llywd and Paul Flynn of Labour. He ran Leanne Wood's successful campaign in the 2012 Plaid Cymru leadership election. In 2014, Edwards criticised Wales rugby captain Sam Warburton for describing himself as British whilst representing the British and Irish Lions. In the run up to the 2014 Scottish independence referendum he was criticised for saying that unionists \"loathe\" their country.Edwards was re-elected in the 2015 general election with 38.4% of the vote. He was appointed as the leader of the Plaid Cymru group in the House of Commons in May 2015, a role he held until October 2015. Edwards supports foxhunting and backed the Conservatives' plans to relax the Hunting Act 2004 in 2015. The Welsh Conservatives criticised a leaflet Edwards wrote for Price in 2016 describing him as Mab Darogan, a figure from folklore destined to force the English out of Britain. In 2016, he called for the return of Welsh bank notes, which Plaid Cymru proposed could be issued by the Lloyds Banking Group. He also called for the renaming of the Bank of England to \"Sterling Central Bank\" to better reflect the UK as a whole. Acting as Plaid Cymru's Brexit spokesperson, Edwards described the Brexit bill as the \"biggest job-killing act in Welsh economic history\". He introduced an amendment which would have required the government to report on the effect on Wales' public finances, which was defeated.He held his parliamentary seat during the 2017 general election with 39.3% of the vote. In a speech at Plaid Cymru's March 2018 spring conference, Edwards warned against his party moving any further to the left politically: \"I would appeal to my party not to respond to the electoral challenges we face from Corbyn's Labour by basing our political strategy on the intricacies of socialist theory.\" Later that year, he criticised Wood as not understanding how important Brexit was, and endorsed Adam Price in the ensuing 2018 Plaid Cymru leadership election. In March 2019, Edwards voted for an amendment tabled by members of The Independent Group calling for a second public vote on EU membership.Edwards was re-elected in the 2019 United Kingdom general election with 38.9% of the vote. \nHe was arrested on suspicion of assault on 20 May 2020, and suspended from the Plaid Cymru group during the police investigation, sitting as an independent. On 27 June, Edwards accepted a police caution for domestic violence against his wife and he was suspended from Plaid Cymru pending an investigation. He said he was \"deeply sorry\" and it was \"the biggest regret\" of his life; his wife Emma accepted his apology. Conservative MP for Brecon and Radnorshire, Fay Jones said Plaid had been too slow to respond, had failed to act and she believed that Plaid had \"turn(ed) a blind eye\" on the issue. On 15 July 2020, Edwards was officially suspended from the party for 12 months after the disciplinary panel concluded its internal investigation. Alun Ffred Jones, the chairman of Plaid Cymru, said: \"All forms of harassment, abuse and violence are unacceptable, and this has been reflected in the verdict.\" Edwards was told that if he wished to rejoin the party, he would have to face the panel again to show that he has reflected and learnt from his actions.One year after the suspension, Edwards remained an independent MP. Speaking to the South Wales Guardian, he confirmed that he had not applied to re-join the party and was yet to make any final decision about his future. He said: \"It's really easy to make hasty decisions about my career and I don't want to rush into anything at the moment. I have missed being part of the Plaid group and my parliamentary colleagues are great friends, but being an independent MP gives you a lot of flexibility. I have really enjoyed working to my own timetable and it could be three years until the next general election, so I'm going to take that time to work through some things before making a final decision.\"In February 2022, he called the Russian invasion of Ukraine \"a despicable act of imperialism that can\u2019t be defended on any count\".\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nEdwards lives in Ammanford. He is married to Emma Edwards and has two children. He was arrested on suspicion of assaulting his wife in May 2020.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nJonathan Edwards MP official constituency website\nJonathan Edwards MP Plaid Cymru profile\n\nProfile at Parliament of the United Kingdom\nContributions in Parliament at Hansard\nVoting record at Public Whip\nRecord in Parliament at TheyWorkForYou\nAppearances on C-SPAN", "infobox": {"name": "Jonathan Edwards", "image": "Official portrait of Jonathan Edwards MP crop 2.jpg", "honorific-suffix": "[[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|MP]]", "office4": "[[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|Member of Parliament]] <br /> for [[Carmarthen East and Dinefwr (UK Parliament constituency)|Carmarthen East and Dinefwr]]", "majority4": "1,809 (4.4%)", "term_start4": "6 May 2010", "predecessor4": "[[Adam Price]]", "birth_date": "{{Birth date and age|1976|04|26|df|=|yes}}", "birth_place": "Capel Hendre, [[Carmarthenshire]], [[Wales]]", "nationality": "[[Welsh people|Welsh]]", "party": "[[Independent politician|Independent]] {{Small|(2020\u2013present)}}", "otherparty": "[[Plaid Cymru]]", "website": "{{URL|https://www.carmarthenshiresvoice.org.uk}}", "caption": "Official portrait, 2020"}, "wikidata": {"member of political party (P102)": "Plaid Cymru (Q10691)", "instance of (P31)": "human (Q5)", "position held (P39)": ["Member of the 57th Parliament of the United Kingdom (Q30524710)", "Member of the 56th Parliament of the United Kingdom (Q30524718)", "Member of the 55th Parliament of the United Kingdom (Q35494253)", "Member of the 58th Parliament of the United Kingdom (Q77685926)", "Member of the 58th Parliament of the United Kingdom (Q77685926)"], "sex or gender (P21)": "male (Q6581097)", "date of birth (P569)": "+1976-04-26T00:00:00Z", "educated at (P69)": "Aberystwyth University (Q319761)", "occupation (P106)": "politician (Q82955)", "given name (P735)": "Jonathan (Q1158394)", "country of citizenship (P27)": "United Kingdom (Q145)", "parliament.uk biography pages (P1996)": "commons/jonathan-edwards/3943", "languages spoken, written or signed (P1412)": "English (Q1860)", "Hansard (2006\u2013March 2016) ID (P2170)": "5701", "PublicWhip ID (P2169)": "Jonathan_Edwards", "name in native language (P1559)": "Jonathan Edwards", "work location (P937)": "London (Q84)", "Freebase ID (P646)": "/m/0bwhspz", "official website (P856)": "http://www.jonathanedwards.org.uk/", "image (P18)": "Official portrait of Jonathan Edwards crop 2.jpg", "Twitter username (P2002)": ["JonathanPlaid", "JonathanPlaid"], "Facebook ID (P2013)": "PlaidSirGar", "VIAF ID (P214)": "4037147907507779210000", "Library of Congress authority ID (P244)": "no2016148501", "family name (P734)": "Edwards (Q2691159)", "UK Parliament identifier (P6213)": "ByHYzTY9", "Democracy Club candidate ID (P6465)": "3577", "candidacy in election (P3602)": ["2019 United Kingdom general election (Q30173038)", "2010 United Kingdom general election (Q215622)", "2015 United Kingdom general election (Q3586935)", "2017 United Kingdom general election (Q25052149)"], "TheyWorkForYou ID (P2171)": "24743", "WorldCat Identities ID (P7859)": "lccn-no2016148501", "Who's Who UK ID (P4789)": "U251537", "Rush Parliamentary Archive ID (P4471)": "9591", "social media followers (P8687)": {"amount": "+12793", "unit": "1"}, "UK Parliament thesaurus ID (P4527)": "300318", "place of birth (P19)": "Carmarthenshire (Q217840)", "C-SPAN person ID (P2190)": "99993", "parliament.uk member ID (P10428)": "3943", "OpenSanctions ID (P10632)": "Jonathan Edwards (Q302892)", "C-SPAN person numeric ID (P10660)": "99993"}, "cat": "Politicians", "url": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Edwards_(Welsh_politician)", "wikibase": "Q302892"}, {"name": "Sir Nic Dakin", "url_name": "27281000", "txt": "Sir Nicholas Dakin (born 10 July 1955) is a British Labour politician who served as the Member of Parliament (MP) for Scunthorpe from 2010 to 2019.

In the early 1990s, he headed the Belarusian delegation on Nuclear and Conventional Weapons Armament Negotiations, also serving as the Belarusian diplomat to Switzerland. From 1995 to 1996, he served as Deputy Foreign Minister of Belarus, resigning as a form of political protest. He co-founded the civil action Charter 97, and was awarded the Bruno Kreisky Prize in 2005.Sannikov was a candidate at the 2010 presidential election in Belarus, and had the second highest percentage of the popular votes after incumbent Alexander Lukashenko. He was incarcerated in a Minsk KGB facility for peacefully protesting at a demonstration after the elections. Sannikov was beaten by police, tortured, and held incommunicado for two months. Amnesty International labeled him a prisoner of conscience. According to his wife, noted journalist Iryna Khalip, as of September 2011 Sannikov was in grave danger of murder and injury while incarcerated, and was being pressured by authorities to leave politics. After 16 months in prison, Sannikov was released and pardoned by Lukashenko in April 2012. Since 2012 he has lived in London, where he received political asylum.\n\n\n== Early life, education ==\nAndrei Sannikov was born on 8 March 1954 in the city of Minsk. His father was a well-known Belarusian art researcher while his mother was a teacher of the Russian language. His grandfather Konstantin Sannikov was a well-known actor and film director in the Byelorussian SSR, one of founders of the Janka Kupala National Theatre, and a teacher at the Belarusian Theater and Art Institute in Moscow. Sannikov first attended school No. 42 as a boy, and in 1977 he graduated from Minsk State Linguistic University. He is fluent in his native Belarusian, Russian, English, and French.After graduating, Sannikov spent time working for a Soviet oil company in Pakistan and in Egypt working on the construction of an aluminum plant.\n\n\n== Diplomatic career ==\n\n\n=== Work at UN Secretariat ===\nSannikov then went to work at the Union of Soviet Societies for Friendship and Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, and in 1982 began serving as a translator (Russian Translation Service) at the UN Secretariat in New York City. He remained in New York for five years.\n\n\n=== Diplomatic Academy ===\nJust before the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union, Sannikov graduated from the Diplomatic Academy of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation in Moscow. Immediately after he worked in the Foreign Ministry of the Belarusian Soviet Socialist Republic. At one of the sessions, he quoted \"The Foreign Ministry should not be in service of one party, but must serve to the Belarusian nation\".\n\n\n=== Nuclear delegation ===\nIn 1992, Sannikov headed the Belarusian delegation on Nuclear and Conventional Weapons Armament Negotiations (the Soviet Republics agreed to disarm all nuclear weapons in 1991). He had authority of signature in the matter on behalf of Belarus, an authority he retained until 1995.During this time, he was also an advisor to the Belarusian diplomatic mission in Switzerland.\n\n\n=== Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs ===\nFrom 1995 to 1996 he served as Deputy Foreign Minister of Belarus, and obtained the rank of Ambassador extraordinary and plenipotentiary.As Deputy Minister in winter of 1995, he co-authored a paper defending the Nunn-Lugar program, and admonishing the U.S. Congress for its inclination to reduce its funding. The Nunn-Lugar project had originated in the U.S. Senate in 1991 after the former Soviet Republics decided to get rid of their nuclear weapons. The program, a part of the U.S. Department of Defense, provided Belarus with technical and financial assistance to reduce and disarm nuclear weapons.In November 1996, on the eve of a controversial referendum, Sannikov resigned from his post in protest of Lukashenko's policies. The referendum severely limited democratic standards and the separation of powers in Belarus, and changed the Belarus constitution to extend Lukashenko's presidential term. According to the Belarus Speaker of Parliament, 20 to 50 percent of the counted votes were falsified.\n\n\n== As independent politician, activist ==\n\n\n=== Charter 97 ===\nIn November 1997, Sannikov was one of the co-founders of the civil initiative Charter 97, becoming its international coordinator. Charter 97 is a human rights group modeled on Charter 77 in then-Czechoslovakia. The group hosts one of the most popular Belarusian news web pages, and is a rare voice of opposition to the Lukashenko party in Belarus.\n\n\n=== 98 Coordinating Council of Democratic Forces ===\nIn 1998, Sannikov and Hienadz Karpienka created the Coordinating Council of Democratic Forces of Belarus, which actively speaks for human rights. Victor Ivashkevich and Mikhail Marinich also took part.\n\n\n=== Protests ===\nIn the years following, Sannikov helped organize a variety of non-violent protests in Belarus, including protests against the elections of 2001, 2004, 2006, and 2008, which were heavily criticized by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe and the EU for lack of transparency, intimidation of voters, suppression of opposition groups, and suspected falsification of results. When the mass protests after the presidential election in 2006 were violently suppressed by riot police, Sannikov stated he was beaten and jailed, and his computers, disks, and memory sticks were seized.\n\n\n=== Bruno Award ===\nOn 4 April 2005, the international Bruno Kreisky Prize was awarded to Sannikov at an award ceremony in the State Hall of the National Library in Vienna. The Bruno Award celebrates accomplishments in human rights.\n\n\n=== European Belarus ===\nIn 2008 Andrei Sannikov, together with Viktar Ivashkevich, Mikhail Marynich and other politicians, initiated the civil campaign European Belarus. The campaign advocates joining Belarus with the European Union and aims to work towards the standards that would allow inclusion.\n\n\n== 2010 presidential campaign ==\nIn March 2010 Andrei Sannikov declared his intention on the TV channel Belsat to take part in Belarus presidential election of 2010 as a candidate. He was considered one of the main opposition candidates along with Vladimir Nekliayev and Yaroslav Romanchuk.\n\n\n=== Platform ===\nIn January 2007, Sannikov voiced disapproval of the natural gas supply contract Lukashenko signed with Russia. Russia has frequently used Gazprom, its state-run gas company, to put pressure on countries such as Ukraine and Georgia. Sannikov worried that as Lukashenko's cordial relations with the Kremlin went sour, especially as Boris Yeltsin was replaced with Vladimir Putin, the new gas supply contract could be used by Russia to manipulate the Belarusian economy.In April 2008, he stated that at the time, Lukashenko was \"consciously set to break relations with the US, after which rupture of relations with Europe could follow as he is preparing surrender of Belarus to Russia. And he needs scapegoats to blame for these things happening.\" At the time, Belarusian authorities were looking to reduce the staff of the Belarusian mission in Washington DC.\nIn November 2010, Sannikov stated that the electoral process was rigged from the outset and that he had no likely chance of defeating Lukashenko. He said his goal was to document the nation's flawed democracy and bring out opposition demonstrators. When asked if he feared for his life, he responded: \"It\u2019s a possibility; you have to think about it\".\n\n\n=== Death of press secretary ===\nIn the first week of September 2010, late on Friday afternoon, Sannikov's close friend and campaign press secretary Oleg Bebenin was found hanged at his summer house on the outskirts of Minsk. Bebenin was also a key member of Sannikov's campaign, and a leading journalist. He was also director and co-founder of Charter97, which had become one of the few outlets for information on \"opposition\" candidates during the election. The official investigation stated that the death appeared to be a suicide. Sannikov expressed suspicion of the \"suicide\", saying that Bebenin was in good mental health, and also that no suicide note was found, among other factors. Index on Censorship attended Bebenin's funeral and echoed Sannikov's concerns that his death was suspicious. Sannikov also stated he had no confidence in the official investigation: \"It's impossible in this situation of dictatorship. Eleven years have passed since the first disappearances began in Belarus and nothing was investigated.\"\n\n\n=== November meeting ===\nOn 18 November 2010, Sannikov was officially registered as a candidate.On 29 November 2010, Sannikov organized a meeting at his alma mater Minsk State Linguistic University, and about 500 people took part. There were attempts to hinder the meeting; flyers were torn down, the administration was prohibited from placing messages on the notice board the day of the meeting, and professors stated they had been warned \"it is better not to attend\" by university staff. Students from other universities and citizens attended as well. During the meeting, he called on students to go to Minsk's October Square at 8 pm after the 19 December election.\n\n\n=== Complaints ===\nOn 15 December 2010, Sannikov logged two legal complaint applications to the Central Election Commission of Belarus, demanding they withdraw the registration of Aleksandr Lukashenko, and also remove Lidiya Yermoshyna, the Chairperson of the Central Election Commission, from office. In both cases, he cited that their positions were illegal. Yermoshyna was a member of Lukashenka's political team, compromising her neutrality, and was under international scrutiny for purportedly rigging the previous election. He also brought up that Lukashenko ignored his own guidelines on how much time presidential candidates were allowed to speak on television (2 times for 30 minutes each). Lukashenko also had propagandistic meetings at places not included on the Minsk City Executive Committee list where meetings could be held; Lukashenko held a large event at the Palace of the Republic, and funded it with the state budget against the rules. Sannikov's complaints were ineffective.\n\n\n== 19 December election ==\nThe presidential elections took place on 19 December 2010, and Aleksandr Lukashenko was proclaimed the winner with 75.65% of the popular vote. Excluding Lukashenko's 5,130,557 votes, Sannikov would have won the election; he earned 156,419 votes or 2.43% of the total. The next closest competitor was Yaroslav Romanchuk, with 127,281 votes, at 1.98%. Of the 1,314,219 votes that went towards \"oppositional candidates\" (anyone not Lukashenko), he earned 11%.\n\n\n=== Demonstration suppression ===\nAfter the election results were revealed, the opposition leaders organized a demonstration on the evening of 19 December in the center of Minsk. However, the demonstration was suppressed by the police. Sannikov and his wife Iryna Khalip were among those attacked by police during the rally, and according to eyewitness statements gathered by Charter 97, Sannikov was singled out from the crowd for a beating.\n\n\"Andrei was beaten by truncheons while he was lying. He was beaten on the head all over the body. Andrei was lying and trying to protect himself with his arms. No one was allowed to come near him so that people could not defend [him].\"\nLater, on the way to the hospital to treat Sannikov's broken legs, their car was intercepted while Khalip was giving a telephone interview to the Moscow radio station Ekho Moskvy (Echo of Moscow). Khalip screamed on air that they were being forcibly removed from their car, arrested, and further beaten.\n\n\n=== Imprisonment ===\nBoth Khalip and Sannikov were detained in a KGB facility in Minsk. According to an eyewitness, Sannikov was forced to stand for an hour during the initial processing, despite the injuries to his legs. Sannikov was subsequently charged for igniting mass disorder which would entail 8 to 15 years in prison.The Obama administration issued a statement saying that the United States did not consider the election to be legitimate and called for the prisoners to be released; by contrast, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev described the Belarus situation as an \"internal affair.\" On 24 December, the KGB raided and searched Sannikov's flat, where his family was staying.\n\n\n=== Custody issue ===\nOn 25 December, the Viasna Human Rights Centre in Minsk revealed that Belarusian authorities had attempted to seize Sannikov's three-year-old son. The boy was being looked after by his three grandparents, but when they tried to take food and blankets to Sannikov at the detention center, social services arrived at the boy's kindergarten. A family lawyer was alerted by friends and intervened in the boy' removal.\n\n\n=== Continued imprisonment ===\nSannikov was held incommunicado at an undisclosed location for two months. A letter from Sannikov was received by his mother on 15 January. At that point, he had not seen his lawyer since 29 December.Sannikov's lawyer Pavel Sapelka was disbarred on 3 March, and his mother was able to find a new defense attorney, Maryna Kavaleuskaya, to represent his case on 12 March. She met briefly with Sannikov on 15 March. Later, Andrei Varvashevich was added to his defense team. They have stated Sannikov is suffering from untreated gout and otitis, as well as leg injuries.The Ministry of Internal Affairs of Belarus accused Sannikov of organizing a \"mass riot, attended by violence against a person, violent attacks, destruction of property, and armed resistance to representatives of the authorities\".The German section of Amnesty International issued an \"urgent action\" alert, stating that they believed Sannikov to be facing torture and maltreatment while in custody.\nApril appealOn 15 April, Minsk City Court heard an appeal from Andrei Sannikov's lawyers, asking for his criminal persecution to be stopped and a softer measure of restraint to be enacted. The appeal was denied. He was to be tried on 27 April. On 14 May he was jailed for five years for organising mass disturbances. According to Amnesty International, as of 18 May, he was being held incommunicado and was at \"serious risk of torture and other ill-treatment\".\nReleaseSannikov was pardoned by President Lukashenko and released on 14 April 2012. Sannikov called on the Belarusian government to release the remainder of its political prisoners.\n\n\n== Post-election activism ==\nIn August 2012, a few months after his release from prison, Lukashenko suggested that Sannikov would soon be rearrested. Sannikov reluctantly fled to the United Kingdom, which granted him political asylum in October 2012. Irina Khalip couldn't leave the country because of her suspended prison sentence. From exile in London, and Warsaw, Poland, Only in 2013 Khalip was allowed a visit in UK to meet her husband. Sannikov has continued to advocate for freedom in Belarus and has said in interviews that the democratic world is becoming \"too complacent\" towards his country and that Belarus poses a threat to international security.After Lukashenko hosted peace talks between the Ukrainian Government and separatists rebels in Eastern Ukraine in February 2015, along with the pardoning of various political prisoners, the European Union has lifted sanctions against his government, a move Sannikov criticized as \"sending the wrong message\".Andrei criticized the 2015 Belarusian presidential election in an interview with Radio France Internationale as a sham, arguing that nothing has changed since the previous election. Andrei made similar comments following the 2020 Belarusian presidential election, praising opposition candidate Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, who was forced into exile by the authorities.In November 2015, Sannikov and Mikola Statkevich both agreed to coordinate their activity to consolidate the \"Belarusian democratic forces\".\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nAndrei Sannikov has two sons. His wife, Belarusian journalist Iryna Khalip, was dubbed a \"Hero of Europe\" by Time in 2005 and was awarded the 2009 Courage in Journalism Award from the International Women's Media Foundation.During the 2020 Belarusian presidential election, he was still residing in Warsaw.\n\n\n== See also ==\nForeign relations of Belarus\n1996 Belarusian referendum\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nEuropean Belarus\nCharter'97\nAndrei Sannikov on Facebook", "infobox": {"name": "Andrei Sannikov", "image": "Sannikov1.jpg", "caption": "Sannikov in 2010", "birth_place": "[[Minsk]], [[Belorussian SSR]], [[Soviet Union]]", "known": "Activism", "nationality": "[[Belarusians|Belarusian]]", "spouse": "[[Iryna Khalip]]"}, "wikidata": {"sex or gender (P21)": "male (Q6581097)", "place of birth (P19)": "Minsk (Q2280)", "date of birth (P569)": "+1954-03-08T00:00:00Z", "image (P18)": "Sannikov1.jpg", "instance of (P31)": "human (Q5)", "Freebase ID (P646)": "/m/0ch4k16", "country of citizenship (P27)": ["Belarus (Q184)", "Soviet Union (Q15180)"], "described by source (P1343)": "Lentapedia (Q17290934)", "occupation (P106)": ["diplomat (Q193391)", "activist (Q15253558)", "politician (Q82955)"], "award received (P166)": ["Bruno Kreisky Award for Services to Human Rights (Q31696)", "Award of Frantsishak Alyakhnovich (Q32128701)"], "given name (P735)": "Andrei (Q27568750)", "significant event (P793)": "prisoner of conscience (Q4667873)", "VIAF ID (P214)": "305022395", "educated at (P69)": "Moscow State Linguistic University (Q1054816)", "name in native language (P1559)": "\u0410\u043d\u0434\u0440\u044d\u0439 \u0410\u043b\u0435\u0433\u0430\u0432\u0456\u0447 \u0421\u0430\u043d\u043d\u0456\u043a\u0430\u045e", "family name (P734)": "Sannikaw (Q27104463)", "GND ID (P227)": "1094709441", "Library of Congress authority ID (P244)": "n2013046898", "NUKAT ID (P1207)": "n2016075356", "residence (P551)": "Minsk (Q2280)", "ISNI (P213)": "0000 0004 1731 1286", "spouse (P26)": "Iryna Khalip (Q468389)", "Nationale Thesaurus voor Auteurs ID (P1006)": "403925851", "Commons category (P373)": "Andrej Sannikau", "NKCR AUT ID (P691)": "js2016935178", "on focus list of Wikimedia project (P5008)": "WikiProject Human rights (Q13382529)", "FAST ID (P2163)": "1988211", "WorldCat Identities ID (P7859)": "lccn-n2013046898", "member of (P463)": "European Belarus (Q97463792)", "IDU person ID (P8385)": "59180", "PLWABN ID (P7293)": "9810584556005606", "Twitter username (P2002)": "A_Sannikov", "sibling (P3373)": "Irina Bogdanova (Q107880148)"}, "cat": "Politicians", "url": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrei_Sannikov", "wikibase": "Q442845"}, {"name": "Bill Wood", "url_name": "28244349", "txt": "Bill Wood  (born 4 November 1935) is an Australian politician who was a member of the Legislative Assembly of Queensland and later the Australian Capital Territory Legislative Assembly.

This fact was also confirmed at a press-conference given at the Football Federation of Lviv Oblast on 26 May 2006. The new president of the new club Yuriy Kindzerskyi informed that his club was not created as a municipal club.In its debut season FC Lviv reached 11th place and scored 45 goals. At the start of the next season, in the beginning of September 2007, the club moved to the newly built stadium Kniazha Arena in Dobromyl, west of Sambir. This arena was constructed by and named after Ukrainian insurance company Knyazha, who is the club's main sponsor. The previous home ground of the club was SKA Stadium in Lviv which fell out of favor with the FFU, PFL.\nIn 2007\u201308 season FC Lviv finished 2nd in the Persha Liha and were promoted to the Premier Liha for the first time in their history, making the club one of the founders of the newly formed Premier League. In 2008\u201309 FC Lviv, despite a sensational opening 2\u20130 win against Shakhtar, were relegated to the Persha Liha. The decisive match for them happened in the last round against another Lviv team Karpaty in the Lviv derby when they lost 2\u20131. The club's first, and only, season in the Premier League was spent at The Ukraina Stadium together with Karpaty under a lease contract.\nIn 2009, the city of Lviv lent the former land property of LORTA Plant for rent to FC Lviv. Out of 3.0542 ha FC Lviv receives 2.9 ha in rent until the spring of 2019 and the rest for only five years.\n\n\n=== FC Lviv (since 2016) ===\nIn 2016 the professional team of FC Lviv was renewed and its future participation in Druha Liha was announced.In May 2018, the club was promoted to the Ukrainian Premier League on pretence of merging with NK Veres Rivne and play in the 2018\u201319 Ukrainian Premier League.\nAt its official website, the club tells that all efforts of NK Veres Rivne are actually efforts of FC Lviv instead. The club states that it was FC Lviv that placed 6th in the 2017\u201318 Ukrainian Premier League, while the same claim for this achievement is laid by Veres Rivne. Records however clearly show that at that time FC Lviv played in the 2017\u201318 Ukrainian Second League and recovered their professional status only in 2017.

This fact was also confirmed at a press-conference given at the Football Federation of Lviv Oblast on 26 May 2006. The new president of the new club Yuriy Kindzerskyi informed that his club was not created as a municipal club.In its debut season FC Lviv reached 11th place and scored 45 goals. At the start of the next season, in the beginning of September 2007, the club moved to the newly built stadium Kniazha Arena in Dobromyl, west of Sambir. This arena was constructed by and named after Ukrainian insurance company Knyazha, who is the club's main sponsor. The previous home ground of the club was SKA Stadium in Lviv which fell out of favor with the FFU, PFL.\nIn 2007\u201308 season FC Lviv finished 2nd in the Persha Liha and were promoted to the Premier Liha for the first time in their history, making the club one of the founders of the newly formed Premier League. In 2008\u201309 FC Lviv, despite a sensational opening 2\u20130 win against Shakhtar, were relegated to the Persha Liha. The decisive match for them happened in the last round against another Lviv team Karpaty in the Lviv derby when they lost 2\u20131. The club's first, and only, season in the Premier League was spent at The Ukraina Stadium together with Karpaty under a lease contract.\nIn 2009, the city of Lviv lent the former land property of LORTA Plant for rent to FC Lviv. Out of 3.0542 ha FC Lviv receives 2.9 ha in rent until the spring of 2019 and the rest for only five years.\n\n\n=== FC Lviv (since 2016) ===\nIn 2016 the professional team of FC Lviv was renewed and its future participation in Druha Liha was announced.In May 2018, the club was promoted to the Ukrainian Premier League on pretence of merging with NK Veres Rivne and play in the 2018\u201319 Ukrainian Premier League.\nAt its official website, the club tells that all efforts of NK Veres Rivne are actually efforts of FC Lviv instead. The club states that it was FC Lviv that placed 6th in the 2017\u201318 Ukrainian Premier League, while the same claim for this achievement is laid by Veres Rivne. Records however clearly show that at that time FC Lviv played in the 2017\u201318 Ukrainian Second League and recovered their professional status only in 2017. This claim is particularly bold as in 2017 NK Veres Rivne as a \"people's club\" had a big scandal with its promotion ahead of FC Desna Chernihiv.\n\n\n== Players ==\nAs of 8 April 2022\n\n\n=== Team squad ===\nNote: Flags indicate national team as defined under FIFA eligibility rules.

Formed in 1877 at the River Clyde in Glasgow, the club host their home matches at New Douglas Park, having played at Broadwood Stadium from 1994 until 2022. Their biggest accomplishment was winning the Scottish Cup on three occasions: 1939, 1955 and 1958; they reached the final a further three times, all during a long period based at Shawfield. They have not played in the top division of Scottish football since 1975.\nThe team are currently managed by Danny Lennon, who was appointed in November 2017.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 1877\u20131898 ===\nThe Clyde Football Club was founded and played on the banks of the River Clyde at Barrowfield. Documentary evidence from the SFA and indeed match reports in the Glasgow press clearly show it all began in 1877, and the thread continues unbroken to this day.\nHere's how the SFA recorded Clyde's origins:\n\n\"Clyde:- Founded 1877; Membership 50; Grounds (private), Barrowfield Park, on the banks of the Clyde; ten minutes walk from Bridgeton Cross; Club House on grounds; Colours, White & Blue. Hon. Secretary, John D. Graham, 24 Monteith Row.\"\nSitting on the edge of Bridgeton, Barrowfield Park lay in a triangle of land enclosed by Carstairs Street, Colvend Street and the river Clyde. The area was an intense mix of chemical, engineering and textile work with a high population density to provide the labour. Although no stadium photographs have emerged, it appears the ground consisted of a grandstand running north\u2013south, a pavilion and tennis courts at the southern end and a bicycle track surrounding the pitch.\nToday this area is dotted with industrial units, but also contains a large grassed area, so it may be possible to stand upon a corner of the original Barrowfield pitch. Barrowfield got initially shared with a short-lived team called Albatross.\nThe club founded then has no resemblance to a modern professional football club. Clyde F.C. was a private members club more akin to a present-day golf or bowling club. Clyde's Secretary, John Graham, was also a noted rower and it seems the club had other sporting and cultural activities besides football.\nThe first mention of Clyde was in Monday's Evening Times of 17 September 1877:\n\n\"Clyde v T. Lanark\nClyde opened their season at Barrowfield with a match against the 3rd Lanark Volunteers. In the end, the 3rd were victors by three goals to 1.\"\nThis concise report was typical at the time as the sport was of little significance and football competed with racing, bowling and quoting for the limited column space available.\nAlthough most fixtures were informal, the Scottish Cup had existed since 1873. Soon there would also be the Glasgow Merchants Charity Cup and the Glasgow Cup which in their time were hotly contested major competitions. Clyde entered the 1st Round of the Scottish Cup on 29 September 1877 along with one hundred and one other teams. Third Lanark were the visitors once again, and triumphed 1\u20130.\nOn 6 March 1883, the Glasgow Football Association was established (formed to compete with the older - 1877 - rival Edinburgh Association), with Clyde one of the six clubs represented at that first meeting. The club are one of only three founding members clubs still in existence today (with Queen's Park and Rangers).Clyde joined the Scottish Football League in 1891, its second edition. Following acceptance, Vale of Leven provided the opposition for Clyde's first League fixture on Saturday, 15 August 1891. In a dream introduction to the format Clyde triumphed 10\u20133, and a mid-table finish saw the club complete a confident season in League football. While it was an undoubted success, Barrowfield revealed its limitations and could not cope with the crowds as many gained illegal entry. Opposition teams complained about the facilities, and it was clear that Clyde would have to do something to appease the League.\nThe club had the pitch dug up in the off season in 1893 to have the clayey surface replaced by ashes to lend additional facilities to the draining powers of the field.The club enjoyed cup success in local competitions as the 19th century drew to a close. The team won the North Eastern Cup and Graham Cup four times apiece. Both tournaments featured teams from the East End of Glasgow. However, Clyde endured a terrible final season at Barrowfield, finishing bottom of Division 1 with only 5 points, but remained in the top division. The last action at Barrowfield was a friendly against crack opposition in the form of Sunderland on 30 April 1898, ending in a 3\u20133 draw.\n\n\n=== 1899\u20131919 ===\nThe club left Barrowfield in 1898 and purchased some open ground (Shawfield) directly across the river  between the Glasgow neighbourhood of Oatlands and the Lanarkshire town of Rutherglen. The move was largely financed by the club becoming incorporated and issuing shares in \"The Clyde Football Club Limited\". On the eve of a new season, Clyde F.C. Ltd had an enclosed area of about 9 acres (3.6 ha). A grandstand seating of 1500 was nearing completion and embankment works around the pitch were well underway.\n\nLocal rivals Celtic provided the first opposition at Shawfield Stadium on 27 August 1898. An attendance of 10,000 witnessed a goalless draw and return gate receipts of \u00a3203. The 1899\u20131900 season saw the team relegated by finishing bottom of top division.They were Division Two champions in 1904\u201305 (and runners up in 1903\u201304 and 1905\u201306), but there was no promotion until the latter second-place finish. Automatic promotion and relegation was not established until 1921. The following seasons up to World War I would be far more successful and represented the most consistent period of success for the club.From 1908 to 1913, Clyde were at the top end of Division One and reached the Scottish Cup final in 1910 and 1912. The team placed third in 1908\u201309 (three points behind champions Celtic) and in 1911\u201312 and reached further semi finals (in 1908\u201309 and 1912\u201313).The 1910 final was a bitter disappointment. For 83 minutes Clyde (McTurk; Watson & Blair; Walker, McAteer & Robertson; Stirling & McCartney; Chalmers; Jackson & Booth) held a 2\u20130 lead (Chalmers and Booth both scored). However, Robertson fluffed a clearance off Blair and into his own net. Dundee then netted a last minute equalizer from Langlands. The replay was far more cagey and ended goalless after extra time, but with Dundee looking physically stronger. Chalmers struck after three minutes to give Clyde a 1\u20130 lead in the third match. Dundee equalized before half time, and as Clyde looked jaded, John Hunter won the cup for Dundee. The 1912 final was a 2\u20130 defeat to Celtic.International honours were awarded to Clyde for the first time in March 1909, as William Walker represented Scotland against club mate Jack Kirwan of Ireland at Ibrox (5\u20130 to Scotland). The Glasgow Charity Cup (in 1910) and Glasgow Cup (in 1914) were won for the first time. Both were highly prestigious competitions before European football was introduced. All six clubs (Celtic, Clyde, Partick Thistle, Queen's Park, Rangers and Third Lanark) were more often than not resident in Division One.In September 1914, a fire destroyed the grandstand, and with it much of the club's early history. After the war broke out in November 1914, the Scottish League would continue playing. Many players signed up for 'King & Country' \u2013 some never returned, such as C. Clunas (2nd Royal Fusiliers), T. Cranston (Black Watch) and W. Sharp (1st Battalion Royal Scots) \u2013 and teams like Clyde found it increasingly difficult to field competitive sides  and the League eventually reduced back to a single division.\n\n\n=== 1920\u20131945 ===\nThe club had managed to sustain football through the war years, but the Scottish League continued through 1919\u201321 with only one division. Division Two restarted in 1921\u201322, with automatic promotion and relegation adopted. Benefits were evident for ambitious teams, but the financial penalties for falling out of the top tier were extremely severe.Relegated in 1923\u201324, Clyde spent two seasons playing teams like Armadale, Arthurlie, Bathgate, Bo'ness, Broxburn, and King's Park until promotion (and another Glasgow Cup) in 1925\u201326. From 1926 to 1939, Clyde remained a Division One club, as the team maintained a respectable mid-table status. International honours returned to Shawfield, as Danny Blair was a prominent Scotland full back of this era and leading goalscorer Billy Boyd (with 32 goals in 1932\u201333) earned two international caps.Liquidation was narrowly averted in 1930. Greyhound racing was booming in the 1920s and many clubs used this a way to supplement their income. A company offered to lease Shawfield in 1926 and also give a percentage of the gate money to Clyde, but animal racing was forbidden in the deeds of Shawfield and the League was dead set against the sport in general. Chairman John McMahon would not let go of the idea. After years of wrangling, the Shawfield Greyhound Racing Company Ltd started racing in 1932 and a few years later purchased the stadium from Clyde.The team conceded a solitary goal on the run to the 1939 Scottish Cup final. Clean sheets were kept against St Johnstone (2\u20130), Dundee (0\u20130 at Dens Park, followed by 1\u20130 in a replay), city rivals Third Lanark (1\u20130), and the Hibernian semi final match (1\u20130 at Tynecastle). The single goal against came at Rangers in the 3rd Round, where prolific centre forward Willie Martin set a record for an opposition at Ibrox by scoring all four goals in a 4\u20131 win.Clyde (Brown; Kirk and Hickie; Beaton, Falloon and Weir; Robertson and Gillies; Martin; Noble and Wallace) faced Motherwell, who had scored the most goals on route to the final, in front of 94,000 at Hampden on 22 April 1939. After losing the coin toss, Clyde goalkeeper Brown was under the most pressure early on. Assisted by a Robertson delivery, Wallace fired the opener in the roof of the net. Despite further opposition pressure before the interval, Martin doubled the lead with an opportunistic strike after the break. Late goals from Noble (netting from a rebound) and Martin (assisted by Noble for his second) sealed an emphatic 4\u20130 win and a maiden Scottish Cup triumph.War with Nazi Germany caused the suspension of the Scottish League in 1939\u201340, and all players' contracts declared void. Unofficial competitions soon restarted with an East/West regional split. The geographical separation meant Clyde were placed in the Southern League. Runners up behind champions Rangers in 1940\u201341 (by three points), the team would continue to perform relatively well in warttime competitions.A second major cup competition, the Scottish League Cup would be inaugurated in 1946. It was the then Clyde and SFL chairman John McMahon who donated the trophy that is still awarded to the winners of the competition to this day.\n\n\n=== 1946\u20131969 ===\nThe club ventured on a 20-match tour of South Africa in 1947 and recorded 16 wins, 2 draws and 2 defeats. Also in 1953, future Ballon d'Or winner Stanley Matthews (and Blackpool teammate Ernie Taylor) turned out for Clyde against Everton in a benefit match at Celtic Park in Belfast.Leslie Johnston, a then Scotland internationalist, twice broke the Scottish transfer record as a Clyde player in the 1940s.\nThe team showed steady league form just after the war and reached a fourth Scottish Cup final in 1948\u201349. In only the fourth edition of the competition since Clyde won it in 1938\u201339, their opponents Rangers ran out comfortable 4\u20131 winners in front of a crowd of 108,000 at Hampden, with Peter Galletly scoring Clyde's consolation goal. It was claimed that both Rangers penalties were of a dubious nature.The 1950s began with relegation from Division A in 1950\u201351, but returned as Division B champions in 1951\u201352. The team repeated the feat in 1955\u201356 and 1956\u201357. Each occasion saw the team bounce back to solid finishes in Division A. Floodlighting was introduced at Shawfield in March 1954. The first opposition was Huddersfield Town in a friendly match. Huddersfield won 3\u20132. Domestic cup success came readily in the 1950s. They won the Scottish Cup in 1954\u201355 and 1957\u201358 and were beaten semi-finalists in 1955\u201356 and 1959\u201360. They also reached Scottish League Cup semi-finals in 1956\u201357 and 1957\u201358, but lost on both occasions to Celtic.The route to the 1954\u201355 Final began with three straight home victories in the competition against Albion Rovers (3\u20130), Raith Rovers (3\u20131) and Falkirk (5\u20130). Aberdeen provided Clyde's semi-final opponents. After a 2\u20132 draw at Easter Road, a solitary goal in the replay sent Clyde into the final. On 23 April 1955 at Hampden in front of over 96,000, Celtic, installed as firm favourites, provided the opposition in the final, in a match that was also the first to be televised live. Without forward McPhail and goalkeeper Wilson, Clyde lined up:- Hewkins, Murphy & Haddock; Granville, Anderson & Laing; Divers & Robertson; Hill; Brown & Ring. Celtic held a 1\u20130 lead with three minutes left until Robertson scored direct from a corner kick to earn a replay. A crowd of over 68,000 gathered for the replay, with the same Clyde line up, a Tommy Ring goal was enough to win a more open affair.The first half of the League Cup tie with Aberdeen at Shawfield on September 3, 1955, was also televised live (a competition first) by the BBC as an experiment.Back at Hampden on 26 April 1958 in front of a crowd of 94,000 to face a strong Hibernian team, Clyde lined up:- McCulloch, Murphy & Haddock; Walters, Finlay & Clinton; Herd & Currie; Coyle; Robertson & Ring. A deflected strike from Coyle in poor conditions gave Clyde a 1\u20130 win and a second Scottish Cup in four seasons and third overall. Fourth place in the final league table and another League Cup semi-final spot completed an impressive season in 1957\u201358. Haddock, Robertson and Coyle were confirmed in the final Scotland squad for the 1958 FIFA World Cup. Dan Currie was selected in the provisional squad, but did not make the final cut.Clyde gained entry into the Friendship Cup in 1960. It was an inter-League competition between four clubs each from England, France and Scotland, with results aggregated to provide the 'best' League. It proved to be an unpopular format and ended in 1962. For the record, Clyde was drawn against RC Lens of Ligue 1 and beat them 4\u20130 away and 2\u20131 at Shawfield. The club began the 1960s as a yo-yo club. Relegations in 1960\u201361 and 1962\u201363 were followed by immediate promotions in 1961\u201362 and 1963\u201364, the former as Division Two champions.At home to Celtic on September 10, 1966, the Clyde team unusually started the match with squad numbers instead of the traditional (1\u201311) positional numbers on their shirts. The team actually returned from the interval with the routine numbering of 1\u201311.The 1966\u201367 season led Clyde to their highest league finish in forty-five years and another Scottish Cup semi-final appearance. Competing largely as a part-time team, Clyde finished third behind the Old Firm clubs. After producing a wonderful season of football that has marked the high tide in the club's fortunes to date, European football will forever love denying itself. The Inter-Cities Fairs Cup had a rule that stipulated only one team per city could enter. Clyde argued that they were not from Glasgow; they were from Rutherglen. However UEFA denied this argument citing Clyde's non-membership of the Lanarkshire FA and their participation in the Glasgow Cup. Rangers had that position. Another League Cup semi-final was reached in 1968\u201369. The club journeyed on a 10-match tour of Rhodesia in 1969 and remained unbeaten (9 wins and 1 draw).As the 1960s came to a close, Clyde was competing rather comfortably in the top division. It was a different story on the terraces with Glasgow's slum clearance programme hitting attendances hard. Large swathes of housing in Bridgeton, Dalmarnock, Gorbals, Oatlands and Rutherglen were being demolished with the inhabitants decanted away to other parts of the city and beyond. Clyde's core support was drawn from these areas, and many of them have never returned to follow the team.\n\n\n=== 1970\u20131993 ===\nThe club began the 1970s as in previous decades, with the threat of relegation of hanging around. In an attempt to quit the city, there was an attempted merger with Hamilton Academical, who were in dire financial trouble and had resigned from the Scottish League. After the move floundered as quickly as it arose, Hamilton quickly rejoined the League. Less than a year later, Dumbarton of Division Two made an audacious bid to merge with Clyde in Division One at the time in return for a cash settlement. The Scottish League quickly quashed the move, after viewing it as Dumbarton trying to gain back-door entry into the top division.After relegation in 1971\u201372, many club legends such as Harry Glasgow, Sam Hastings, Tommy McCulloch, Graham McFarlane and Eddie Mulheron moved on. Clyde did recover and won promotion as Division Two champions in 1972\u201373. Two years in the top division until another relegation in 1974\u201375 would be their last in the top division to date. The Premier Division was introduced ahead of the season 1975\u201376 as the new top division, with inclusion based upon league position. A poor 16th-place finish in Division One in season 1974\u201375 meant Clyde was never in contention. The club now found themselves back in the second tier, now known as the First Division.The club found a new role, discovering and developing talent before selling it on. Shawfield was the starting point for future Scotland internationalists like Steve Archibald, Ian Ferguson and Pat Nevin. Problems on and off the pitch saw Clyde move into freefall. After finishing bottom of the First Division in 1975\u201376, they found themselves in the Second Division, the third tier, for the season 1976\u201377. They only could muster a seventh-place finish. In a decade Clyde had gone from the third best team in Scotland to a single spot above the finishing last in the Scottish football league system. Towards the end of the season, Celtic legend Billy McNeill took charge but left for Aberdeen after only a few months at the helm. The club then turned to the relatively unknown Craig Brown, and he had immediate success as the team won the Second Division in 1977\u201378.Problems were arising at Shawfield. The stadium was falling into a state of disrepair, and the grounds were not well maintained. By the late 1970s, Shawfield came into the hands of the Greyhound Racing Association (GRA). Greyhound racing had been in decline since 1963 when off-course betting was allowed. To compensate for this, the GRA had transformed itself into a property company and had a policy of acquiring and redeveloping dog tracks for commercial and residential uses.They became the first Scottish club to adopt a shirt sponsor in 1979\u201380. The club secured a deal with the British Oxygen Company. As a guest of the SFA, Fabio Capello worked with manager Craig Brown and the team at Shawfield for a short stint in the early 1980s when he started coaching.Relegation from the First Division in 1979\u201380 was followed by another promotion as Second Division champions in 1981\u201382. Shawfield eventually came on the open market in 1983 with a \u00a3500,000 price tag. The club was served with a notice to quit Shawfield by 1986. Alloa Athletic provided the final opposition at Shawfield on 28 April 1986. Clyde claimed a 4\u20132 win. The unpopular but necessary decision was taken to ground-share with city rivals Partick Thistle. Clyde spent five unhappy seasons at Firhill, and there was a sense of relief when Clyde departed. The club was grateful for the use of Firhill, but there was an underlying sense of being tolerated as an inconvenient annoyance.The 'Gypsy Army' reference came into being as Clyde supporters sought pride and solace during the club's homeless years. The club then negotiated a ground-share at Douglas Park with Hamilton Academical, where Clyde resided for two and a half seasons as plans were developed and implemented to build a new home in Cumbernauld. Meanwhile, on the field, relegation from the First Division in 1990\u201391, was followed by promotion again as Second Division champions in 1992\u201393 and an immediate relegation in 1993\u201394.  However, this continued the tradition of the yo-yo existence the club had become known for at certain times in previous decades.\n\n\n=== 1994\u2013present ===\nThe Cumbernauld Development Corporation was keen to have a sports stadium and professional football team to promote the town, and Cumbernauld, with a 50,000+ population, seemed fertile ground on which to grow new support. A new site called \"Broadwood\" was to have an integrated business, housing and leisure development with a football stadium at the heart of it. With the help of Football Trust backing, two modern stands began to emerge during the early 1990s.\nThe Scottish League unusually granted permission for Clyde to switch grounds mid-season, and former landlords, Hamilton Academical, were the inaugural opposition on 5 February 1994. A capacity crowd of 6000 watched as Clyde lost to the Accies 2\u20130.\nClyde dropped to the third tier of football, and in 1998 they almost fell into the lowest reaches of Senior football. However, this was enough for the new chairman, Billy Carmichael, to introduce changes. Ronnie MacDonald got appointed as manager, having worked at Maryhill Juniors. MacDonald signed a whole squad from the Junior ranks, and within two seasons Clyde had gained promotion.  Subsequently, Allan Maitland won promotion to the Scottish First Division in 1999.\nThe 2003\u201304 season saw Clyde atop the League and looking set for the SPL. But Broadwood did not comply with SPL requirements and crucially Clyde was on the brink of being petitioned by their creditors and liquidated. While the chairman's fortune was well spent on players' wages, very little else got serviced. The SPL relented and said Clyde could join them if the fourth stand got built. North Lanarkshire Council started the groundworks and then abruptly halted them as they became aware of Clyde's financial plight. Plan B, playing at Kilmarnock, was investigated.  In the event, a draw with Ayr United and a home loss to Inverness Caledonian Thistle meant that Clyde missed out on promotion.\nThe Clyde Supporters' Trust formed during the 2003\u201304 season. Early that season some concerned fans met knowing that the chairman could not keep financing the Club indefinitely.  The timing of the Trust's formation coincided with Clyde's failure to gain promotion, and the chairman sought to sell his majority shareholding. Following lengthy negotiations, a consortium of the Trust and traditional investors increased the majority shareholding for a nominal sum. The Clyde Development Consortium took control of funds gathered by fans and investors and used it to finance the Club through a CVA to clear the debts. In June 2005 the CVA was completed, and Clyde was mostly debt free.\nIn a season, 2005\u201306, that saw Clyde lead 2\u20131 from 1\u20130 behind at Rangers in a League Cup tie with 17 minutes left before a goalkeeping error gifted Rangers an equalizer, with Clyde going on to lose in extra time, the other half of the Old Firm, Celtic visited Broadwood in the Scottish Cup on 8 January 2006. Celtic were such heavy favourites that the game was presented as a gentle introduction for their new signing, Roy Keane. Clyde, however, won 2\u20131. The goal scorers for Clyde were Eddie Malone and Craig Bryson whilst Celtic's goal scorer was Maciej Zurawski. Clyde reached the 2006 Challenge Cup Final, their first final for 48 years, since their Scottish Cup success in 1958. They lost the game 5\u20134 on a penalty shootout, after the game finished 1\u20131 following extra time.Former Scotland captain Colin Hendry was appointed manager in summer 2007. On 14 August of that year, Clyde history was made when Michael Doherty became the youngest person ever to play for Clyde in a competitive match, a feat later broken by Connor Stevenson in a league match at Palmerston on 25 April 2009.Hendry resigned in January 2008, due to family reasons. Former Rangers defender John 'Bomber' Brown replaced him as manager. Clyde entered the final game of the season needing to better Morton's result to avoid getting forced into the playoffs. Clyde won their game 3\u20130, but in a cruel twist of fate, Morton won their own game by the same scoreline, sending Clyde into a two-legged play-off with Second Division side Alloa Athletic. Clyde lost the first leg 2\u20131 and at 3\u20131 down in the home second leg looked as good as relegated. However, a thrilling fightback saw Clyde level at 5\u20135 on aggregate (4\u20133 on the day) before adding another goal in extra time to progress. Home and away victories over Airdrie United in the play-off final then secured First Division football at Broadwood for another season.\nHowever, the following season Clyde finished bottom of the First Division and got relegated to the Second Division. Meanwhile, off the park, financial problems were once again apparent. In a hope to try and avoid administration in June 2009, Clyde terminated the contracts of the entire first-team squad, with only youngsters remaining under contract at the club. The squad for 2009\u201310 was rebuilt on a drastically reduced budget with a repeat of open trials which were successful in 2005. However early results were not good, and the board appointed Neil Watt as Director of Football and John McCormack as first team coach. After a brief upturn in results, Clyde went six games without a win, and on Saturday 21 November, with the team sitting three points adrift at the bottom of the Second Division, it was announced that John Brown had left his position as manager. On Monday 5 April John McCormack was sacked by Clyde.More history was made in a home match with Peterhead on 17 April 2010, when Willie Sawyers scored after only eight seconds, which became the fastest Clyde goal ever recorded. Despite this, the club was subsequently relegated for the second season in a row, dropping down to the Third Division where they made a disastrous start to the campaign, including an 8\u20131 thrashing at the hands of Montrose. On Wednesday 2 February 2011, Stuart Millar was sacked as manager of Clyde. They finished 10th in the Third Division, which at 42nd and last place overall is the lowest position in the Scottish league system.\nOn 20 April 2013 Clyde's owners voted to move to East Kilbride and rename the club EK Clyde FC, however this plan would later be abandoned. The 2013\u201314 season saw a significant improvement on the field when a League One play-off spot was secured in the penultimate league match of the season. In the previous six seasons Clyde had finished in the bottom two positions of every league campaign. However, the club missed out on promotion after a play-off semi-final defeat on penalties to East Fife. Gordon Young became the first Clyde player to score with their first touch on their club debut in a match against Elgin City on 1 March 2014.Duffy resigned as manager of Clyde on 19 May 2014 to take up the vacant managerial post at Greenock Morton, while John Taylor, a member of the boardroom since 1986, and the club's longest serving director had stepped down in April. In October 2014, the club were declared officially debt free, having accumulated an unsustainable debt of \u00a31.4 million as a result of the club's failed promotion bid to the SPL during season 2003\u201304, with the burden of debt having weighed heavily on the shoulders of the club for the next decade. Scott Durie became the first Clyde player to play every single minute of every competitive match in a season, during the 2014\u201315 season.Former Rangers, Blackburn and Scotland midfielder Barry Ferguson was appointed as player-manager of Clyde in June 2014 and took the club to a 6th-place finish in his first season in charge. Ferguson officially retired as a player towards the end of that season. The following year, Clyde finished 3rd in League Two but got beaten in the playoff final. On 25 February 2017 with the club in 8th place in League Two after a 1\u20130 defeat to Annan Athletic and with no realistic prospect of gaining promotion after a ten-match winless run, Ferguson resigned as manager of Clyde, with his assistant Bob Malcolm taking interim charge of the side until a new manager was appointed.After nine years in the bottom tier of Scottish football, at the end of the 2018\u201319 season, Danny Lennon led Clyde to promotion to Scottish League One, beating Annan Athletic 2\u20131 on aggregate to win the promotion play-off final.\n\n\n== Grounds ==\n\n\n=== Barrowfield ===\nClyde has had five home grounds since they formed in 1877. The first of these was Barrowfield Park, situated on the banks of the River Clyde between the Glasgow neighbourhoods of Bridgeton and Dalmarnock.\n\n\n=== Shawfield ===\n\nBy 1898, Barrowfield became too small in capacity to deal with the large crowds of spectators. The club then moved across the river to build a new stadium, which would be known as Shawfield Stadium.\nA crowd of 10,000 saw the first match at Shawfield against Celtic. In 1908, a group of 52,000 gathered for a game against Rangers, which remains Clyde's record home attendance to this day. Financial pressures led to the club relinquishing ownership of the stadium in 1935, selling it their former tenants, the Greyhound Racing Association. This arrangement continued satisfactorily for over 50 years until the GRA announced redevelopment plans for the stadium and gave Clyde notice to quit in 1986.\n\n\n=== Broadwood ===\n\nIn 1990, Clyde had secured an agreement to move into a stadium in the new town of Cumbernauld, which due to shifting population patterns was by now one of the larger settlements in Scotland without a senior football team. The new all-seater Broadwood Stadium would not be ready until 1994.\nClyde moved into the venue midway through the 1994\u201395 season. Broadwood has hosted Scotland U21 matches and four Scottish Challenge Cup finals in the past. Broadwood was also home to Airdrieonians for four seasons from 1994 to 1998 and Rangers reserves for a while.\nOn 9 December 2010, Clyde had informed their landlords at North Lanarkshire Council (NL Leisure) of their intention to relinquish their lease on Broadwood and move elsewhere. Furthermore, on 19 October 2011, Clyde revealed that they were investigating the possibility of a move to East Kilbride, the largest town in Scotland without a senior football team. Another option was to move back to Rutherglen and develop the Clyde Gateway Stadium in a ground-sharing agreement. This had received approval from current tenants Rutherglen Glencairn.In April 2022, the club announced they would be leaving Broadwood at the end of the 2021\u201322 season, ending their 28-year stay in Cumbernauld. They will be ground-sharing with Hamilton Academical at New Douglas Park from the start of the 2022\u201323 season, with a view of relocating to a new home back in Glasgow in the near future.\n\n\n=== Groundsharing ===\n\nAfter the Great War began, in September 1914, a fire completely destroyed the grandstand at Shawfield. Clyde were forced to switch their home games for a while. Celtic, the club's East End neighbours, offered up  Celtic Park as an alternative venue for home games.After Celtic Park suffered similar damage in March 1929, The club had to play the rest of their matches in the 1928\u201329 season at nearby Shawfield. (reciprocating an earlier arrangement in 1914 when Clyde suffered similar damage to their ground).On March 1, 1958, Clyde hosted Celtic in the Scottish Cup. Set for Shawfield, the match was moved to Celtic Park over safety concerns. However, Clyde still had home advantage because the home stand tickets were initially reserved for Clyde ticket holders with Celtic tickets ineligible. The Bully Wee won 2\u20130 in front of 65,000, with goals from Ring and Currie. The full back pairing of Haddock and Murphy were reported to have been immense.\n\nAfter quitting Shawfield in 1986, the club investigated several local options. Clyde secured an agreement with arch-rivals Partick Thistle to share their ground Firhill for five seasons until 1991. Despite reaching an agreement to move into Broadwood in 1990, it would not be until 1994 when the ground was ready, so Clyde shared with Hamilton Accies at their Douglas Park for a further three seasons.\n\nThe club negotiated a groundshare with Alloa to use Recreation Park for the club's first home game of the 2012\u201313 season, a first round Challenge Cup match against Partick Thistle. During pre-season work had begun at Broadwood to replace the grass pitch with an artificial surface (astroturf) and the pitch was not finished in time for their first home match of the season. Clyde were confident that the pitch would be completed and all the details finalised for the club's first home league match of the season in time for the visit of Peterhead. The match was switched to Recreation Park for the second successive home game after a pitch inspection carried out earlier in the week by the SFL decided that the pitch was not at the stage of completion as expected. Installation of the new surface was completed in time for the club's next home match of the league season.\n\n\n== Supporters ==\nClyde Football Club is 100% owned by the supporters.The supporters' fiercest rivalry is with Partick Thistle, given that the two clubs are both of smaller stature to that of Rangers and Celtic. However, given the success and promotion of Partick Thistle to the Scottish Premiership, and Clyde's recent relegation to the Scottish League Two, such derby games have become a rarity in past years. Both clubs are in League One together in the 2020\u201321 season.\nThe number of years Clyde spent without a permanent home of their own led to the fans identifying themselves as the Gypsy Army.\nThe Clyde Supporters Social Club on Rutherglen Main Street burned down in the early 2000s and has never been rebuilt or re-opened. There was also a Supporters Club located in Kirkintilloch.The Clyde Supporters' Trust got formed during season 2003\u201304. A group of fans became aware of the club's severe financial problems as Billy Carmichael's reign as chairman came to an end. It was formed in time to save the club and keep it in the supporter's hands in a time that coincided with Clyde's failure to gain promotion and the chairman looking to sell his majority shareholding.In the past the Supporters' Trust has financed the signings of players such as John Potter and Tom Brighton, and retaining the signatures of players such as Neil McGregor and David Hutton.\nThe Clyde supporters also run their own supporters team called Bully Wee United. Bully Wee United are recognised as the official supporters team of Clyde and represent the club in the IFA League with matches well played Saturday mornings. Matches are normally against the supporter's teams of the opposition facing the first team on the same day. Bully Wee United is unique in most Scottish supporters teams as they operate a strict policy that only Clyde supporters may play for the team. Players must attend a minimum number of Clyde games over a season. Clyde is also represented in the Scottish Central Amateur League by another supporters team named Broadwood Clyde. They got formed in 1994. They were crowned SSFL Division One league champions in 2005. They also won the SSFL League Cup in 2004 and SSFL Inter-Division Cup in 2003 making them the most successful Clyde supporters team. Broadwood Clyde play their homes games at Ravenswood in Cumbernauld on Sunday afternoons.\n\n\n=== The Clyde View ===\nThe Clyde View is Clyde's official matchday programme. It won the Scottish Programme of the Year Award every season from 1995\u201396 to 2006\u201307, and again in 2008\u201309. It also won the Scottish Divisional Programme of the Year Award every season from 1991\u201392 to 2011\u201312. It won the inaugural Scottish Divisional Programme Best Design of the Year Award for season 2011\u201312.On Wirrel's UK Programme of the Year, it achieved a top ten finish on three consecutive occasions from 2002\u201303 to 2004\u201305; 8th (2002\u201303), 6th (2003\u201304) and 5th (2004\u201305).\n\n\n== Nickname ==\nThe club's nickname, \"The Bully Wee\", is of uncertain origin although the club themselves have advanced three theories.The first suggests that the clubs and supporters and perhaps players mainly came from Bridgeton, Glasgow, a tight working-class area whose inhabitants had a reputation as \"wee bullies\", with this becoming transposed as the Bully Wee.\nAlternatively, it is also claimed that it comes from around 1900 when a group of French supporters paid a visit to Barrowfield and, upon the scoring of a disputed goal, were heard to remark  \"But il'y, oui?\" or \"Their goal, yes\". Supporters heard this unfamiliar phrase as \"Bully Wee\", and the name stuck.\nFinally the third theory, and the one accepted by the club as the most plausible, links the term to the old Victorian idiom \"bully\" meaning first-rate or high standard and suggests that Clyde, a small club, would have been regularly referred to as \"Bully Wee Clyde\", with the first two words eventually becoming the standalone nickname.\nClyde's supporters also go by the name of \"Gypsy Army\". Due to the number of years the club spent homeless, rival fans called Clyde fans \"gypsies\" as a slur. The supporters of Clyde adopted this as a badge of honour and the \"Gypsy Army\" was born. Despite now having a settled home at Broadwood Stadium the nickname lives on in terracing songs, supporters buses and supporters football teams.\n\n\n== Rivalries ==\nHistorically seen as a Glasgow club, local rivalries (Glasgow derby) were developed and forged with other teams from in and around the city, in particular Celtic (also from the East End), Rangers, Partick Thistle and Queen's Park and the now-defunct Third Lanark.For most of the 20th century, they were six of leading clubs in the country. More often than not all six clubs reside in the top division, with fiercely contested competitions such as the Glasgow Cup and Glasgow Charity Cup (before European football) on top of national tournaments, it saw the clubs pitted against one another multiple times a season.A team called Thistle FC, also known Glasgow or Bridgeton Thistle, were early rivals to the club. Formed a decade before Clyde in 1868, Thistle's first ground was situated nearby at the club's original home Barrowfield Park. Thistle's last fixture was a friendly against the full first team of Clyde at Barrowfield before going out of existence in 1894.The Clyde vs Partick Thistle derby was previously a fierce battle between two of Glasgow's smaller clubs, in comparison to the Old Firm. The rivalry intensified when Thistle became Clyde's landlords at Firhill for five years in the 1980s. The decision to groundshare was never fully accepted by either set of fans. After quitting Clyde on free transfer to sign for the Firhill club (newly promoted to the SPL) in 2002, Jamie Mitchell stated he was shocked by the reaction of Clyde supporters to the move. He referred to it as getting the \"Mo Johnston treatment\". Former Jags midfielder Scott Chaplain (once a signing target for Clyde) spoke of the \"competitive edges to those particular matches\" after playing in the fixtures many times. When talking about a possible groundshare again, Partick Thistle chairman David Beattie said it would reignite the Glasgow-rivalry saying \"the healthy rivalry between ourselves and the Bully Wee is historical\". Due to Partick Thistle's promotion to Scotland's highest professional league, the Scottish Premiership, in the 2010s and Clyde's relegations to the lower leagues in the same period, matches between the two clubs became less common. However, by 2020 they found themselves in the same division (Scottish League One) once again, with a revived version of the Glasgow Cup also offering more meetings.\nDuring the 2010s, Queen's Park became the natural rivals to Clyde, as both clubs were stuck in the bottom league (fourth tier) for the majority of the decade. From 2010 to 2016, Clyde were on a demoralising run of results against Queen's Park: the Spiders won 17 and drew 3 of the 26 matches. This included a run of 11 successive wins (scoring 29 goals in that run).Geographically classed as a North Lanarkshire club since the 1994 move to Cumbernauld, Clyde's matches against Airdrieonians, Albion Rovers, Motherwell or Hamilton Academical can be considered a Lanarkshire derby. In recent times, a rivalry developed with Hamilton.\n\n\n== Managers ==\n\n\n== First-team squad ==\nAs of 6 May 2022Note: Flags indicate national team as defined under FIFA eligibility rules.

The club won the Reserve League Cup for the first time in May 2008. They defeated Livingston 4\u20131 on their own ground at Almondvale with Dave McKay scoring all four goals for Clyde. It was the team's first piece of silverware at reserve level for twenty years. The following season the club were knocked out by Ross County in the semi-finals losing 3\u20130 in Dingwall.\n\n\n=== Reserve team history ===\n\n\n==== 'A' Team ====\nIt was common from the beginning of reserve football for the majority of club's reserve teams (second XI's) to go by the tag \u2018A\u2019 or sometimes \u2018B\u2019 or even \u2018C\u2019 if a club had more than one reserve side. It wasn't until after the formation of the new Scottish Reserve League in 1955 that today's reserve teams go by the actual tag \u2018reserves\u2019 and have done since 1957.During the 1881\u201382 season, Clyde reached the semi-finals of the Scottish 2nd XI Cup in the competitions the first season. In 1896-97 they reached their first 'major' cup final, the Scottish 2nd XI Cup final eventually losing 4\u20130 to Hearts. After reaching the semi-finals again in 1905\u201306, they were thwarted by arch-rivals Partick Thistle this time.\nThe club first joined the Scottish Reserve League in 1909-10 and found the first few years of competing in the league though. It wasn't until the 1913\u201314 season when they made their mark when they lost 1\u20130 at Hearts in a league decider for the Reserve League title. It meant that the club missed out on a unique League and Cup double after they captured the Scottish 2nd XI Cup for the first time that season. They dispatched of St Mirren  in the final over two legs (1-1 away and 3\u20131 at home). They successfully defended the Scottish 2nd XI Cup the following season when Clyde overcame Falkirk in the final over two legs (2-1 loss away and a 3\u20131 home win).\nTheir third and final Scottish 2nd XI Cup triumph came in 1941\u201342. It would be the team's last 'major' cup success for the next sixty-six years. In 1945-46 they reached their last Scottish 2nd XI Cup final losing to Hibs, after a superb 6-2 derby victory over arch-rivals Partick Thistle in the semifinals.The Scottish Reserve League merged with the Scottish C Division (third tier) for the 1949\u201350 season creating two regionalised divisions (South/West and North/East) with Clyde entering a reserve team in the South & West region. The club was crowned champions in 1949\u201350 and they retained their title in 1950\u201351. Despite successive titles, there was no promotion as only first teams could gain promotion to Division B. As reserve teams got excluded from the Scottish League Cup, the C Division had their League Cup. Clyde couldn't quite match the success in the cup that they had in the league as they never won the competition. The best they could manage were semi-final appearances in 1951-52 and in 1953\u201354.\n\n\n==== League restructuring ====\nAfter both regional C Divisions got scrapped in June 1955, a new Scottish Reserve League started up. The new Reserve League was an exclusively all First Division league (a mirror image of the senior league) and all Second Division clubs' reserve sides got excluded from joining. There were several seasons when not all clubs took part. As for teams who were turned away or excluded from joining, they joined various supplementary leagues over the next few years.\nFor the first few seasons between 1955 and 1960, Clyde regularly finished quite high up the table or at least in a mid-table position. From then onwards in the seasons they spent in the league, the team were often at the wrong end of the table.\nIn one of the seasons that Clyde didn't participate in the Reserve League, they joined the Combined Reserve League for a single season in 1961\u201362. Due to the small number of teams involved, the competition got split into an Autumn Series and Spring Series. The club won the Autumn Series and finished second overall in the Combined Table.\nJust like Clyde's first team, whose last spell in the Scottish top flight came in 1974\u201375, the same fate happened to their reserve team following a further league restructure at senior and reserve level. The Reserve League set-up changed again in 1975 after a reorganisation of the 'senior' Scottish League into Premier-First-Second Divisions. The new Premier Reserve League was a mirror image of the new Scottish Premier Division in terms of membership. Lower league clubs used varying set-ups such as east\u2013west sections and midweek competitions. In later games, clubs didn't always participate as running a reserve side became expensive.\nIt wasn't until season 1979\u201380 when Clyde gained membership to re-enter a reserve team in the Scottish Reserve League. They got placed in the regional West division. Finishing bottom in their first season, it was a further two seasons before they returned. They fared much better during the 1987\u201388 season when they won the division. It proved to be a one-off, though. Season 2000\u201301 was Clyde's last in the West Reserves League eventually before all reserves leagues got scrapped after season 2007\u201308.\n\n\n=== Youth teams ===\nThe club ran youth teams at under-20, under-17, under-15, under-14, under-13, under-12, and under-11 level. There was an under-18 team until 2003, when it made way for under-17 and under-19 teams. The under-20 team replaced the under-19 team in 2014. The club also run Football Schools in Cumbernauld (since 2006) and Glasgow Southside (since 2008). Both schools have since been awarded the SFA Quality Mark Award at Standard Level and then at Development Level.The Community Foundation received the Gold award in the SFA Quality Mark category for grassroots football. The Foundation also received the Young Start Award in 2017 to run a project called Start Young, Grow Young. The club were forced to scrap their youth academy from under 11 to under 17 levels in 2015 citing a reduction in funding from the Scottish FA, with the under-20 side the only youth team remaining, which acts as a feeder to the first team for young players.The team reached the Scottish Youth Cup semi finals in 1988, but were beaten by Dunfermline Athletic. The under-17 team reached the SFL Youth Cup final in 2004 losing 4\u20131 on penalties to Hamilton Accies at New Douglas Park despite scoring in stoppage time of extra time to make it 1\u20131. Both of the under-19 and under-17 teams reached the semi finals of their SFL Youth Cups in 2006. The under-19 team finished runners-up behind Celtic in the inaugural SPFL under-19 league in 2014.The under-19 team travelled to the Netherlands in 2003, taking part in a highly rated youth football programme called the Leonardo Project hosted by FC Dordrecht. They played three times against an under-19 team of the hosts, which contained Dutch youth internationalists, winning two and drawing one. In the third match, the opposition was made up of reserves and first team fringe players. They followed this up with a win over local amateur team vv Capelle and a narrow defeat to a youthful FC Utrecht team.The Lanarkshire FA started the Lanarkshire Supercounty Trophy for all four senior Lanarkshire clubs' under-17 teams in 2013. Clyde beat Motherwell in the semi final, but lost to Accies in the final. The under-17's also reached their sectional League Cup final in 2017. The Community Foundation youth teams reached Divisional Cup finals in 2018 and 2019.From the 2018\u201319 season, Clyde have replaced their Under 20 side with a project alongside North Lanarkshire Council called Project Braver, which will see young players play at youth level with a chance to progress to the first team, alongside providing further education or apprenticeship opportunities for the players.\n\n\n==== Graduates ====\nGraduates of the youth team who have gone on to play for the first team since moving to Broadwood Stadium include:\n\nScottish internationals Pat Nevin, Steve Archibald and Ian Ferguson also came through the Clyde youth system.\n\n\n== Hall of Fame ==\n\nThe club launched its official Hall of Fame in 2011, with five inaugural inductees. Three more were inducted in 2012. The Clyde team of season 1966\u201367 was inducted in 2014. There was one inducted in 2015. There is also a Hall of Fame section on the club website.\n\n\n== Honours ==\n\n\n=== Minor trophies ===\n\nGlasgow Cup: 1914\u201315, 1925\u201326, 1946\u201347, 1951\u201352, 1958\u201359\nRunners-up: Fifteen timesGlasgow Merchants Charity Cup1: 1909\u201310, 1939\u201340, 1951\u201352, 1957\u201358, 1960\u201361\nRunners-up: 1911\u201312, 1924\u201325, 1941\u201342, 1943\u201344, 1958\u201359Southern League\n\nRunners-up: 1940\u201341Summer Cup\n\nRunners-up: 1943\u201344West of Scotland League / Shield: 1904\u201305, 1906\u201307\n\nRunners-up: 1905\u201306Glasgow & District Midweek League\n\nRunners-up: 1912\u201313Glasgow North Eastern Cup: 1890\u201391, 1892\u201393, 1893\u201394, 1894\u201395\n\nRunners-up: 1882\u201383, 1885\u201386Graham Cup: 1888\u201389, 1889\u201390, 1890\u201391Paisley Charity Cup: 1938\u201339, 1939\u201340\nRunners-up: 1944\u201345St Vincent de Paul Charity Cup\n\nRunners-up: 1938Friendship Cup: 1960\u201361 (joint-winners)1Clyde shared the trophy with Third Lanark in 1952 and with Celtic in 1961.\n\n\n=== Friendly trophies ===\nKeyline Challenge Cup: 1999, 2000, 2001\n\nRunners-up: 2002Tommy McGrane Cup: 2006Broadwood Cup: 2020Optical Express Challenge Cup\n\nRunners-up: 2005, 2009\n\n\n=== Reserves ===\n\n\n=== Youth ===\nLeague Cup (under 17s):\nRunners-up: 2004\nRangers Youth Invitational Tournament (under 13s):\nWinners: 2008\nHelensburgh Bi-Centennial Tournament (under 13s):\nWinners: 2002\nKildrum United Football Festival (under 13s):\nWinners: 2007\nOban Saints Youth Tournament (under 13s):\nRunners-up: 2011\nCKSSDA 11-a-side Tournament (under 12s):\nWinners: 2008\n\n\n== Records ==\nRecord home attendance: 52,000 vs Rangers (28 November 1908) (at Shawfield Stadium); 8,000 vs Celtic (Scottish Cup) (8 January 2006) (at Broadwood Stadium)\nRecord win: 11\u20131 vs Cowdenbeath (6 October 1951), 10\u20130 vs Stranraer (14 August 1957)\nRecord European win: 4\u20130 vs RC Lens (7 August 1960)\nRecord loss: 11\u20130 vs Dumbarton (22 November 1897)\nMost capped player: Tommy Ring: 12 (Scotland)\nMost international goals: Tommy Ring: 2 (Scotland), Archie Robertson: 2 (Scotland)\nMost goals in one season: Billy McPhail: 36 (1951\u201352), Basil Keogh: 36 (1956\u201357)\nYoungest player: Connor Stevenson, aged 16 years and 245 days (against Queen of the South in the Scottish First Division on 15 April 2009)\n\n\n== Noted players ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nClyde BBC My Club page\nHistorical Kits\nScottish 2nd XI Cup\nScottish Football Federation (Second version 1898-99)\nScottish Football Alliance (First version 1891-1897)\nScottish Football Alliance (Third version 1919-1938)\nScottish Football Alliance (Fifth version 1939-40)\nScottish Football Alliance (Sixth version 1956-57)\nScottish Reserve League (Second version 1909-191)\nScottish Reserve League (Third version 1938-39)\nScottish Reserve League (Fourth version 1945-1949)\nScottish Reserve League (Fifth version 1975-2008)\nScottish (Reserve) League (1955-1975)\nC Division overview (1949-55)\nCombined Reserve Football League (First version 1958-1972)\nCombined Reserve Football League (Second and Third versions 1973-74 & 1975-76)", "infobox": {"clubname": "Clyde", "image": "Clyde FC logo.png", "image_size": "200px", "fullname": "Clyde Football Club", "nickname": "The Bully Wee", "founded": "{{Start date and age|df|=|yes|1877}}", "ground": "[[New Douglas Park]], [[Hamilton, South Lanarkshire|Hamilton]]", "capacity": "{{SPFL-stadiums|hamilton}}", "chairman": "Gordon Thomson", "manager": "[[Danny Lennon]]", "league": "{{Scottish football updater|Clyde}}", "season": "{{Scottish football updater|Clyde2}}", "position": "{{Scottish football updater|Clyde3}}", "pattern_la1": "_pumagoal23wr", "pattern_b1": "_pumagoal23wr", "pattern_ra1": "_pumagoal23wr", "pattern_sh1": "_srb18a", "leftarm1": "FFFFFF", "body1": "FFFFFF", "rightarm1": "FFFFFF", "shorts1": "FFFFFF", "socks1": "FFFFFF", "pattern_la2": "_khimki1819h", "pattern_b2": "_pumahooped1819blackred", "pattern_ra2": "_khimki1819h", "leftarm2": "FF0000", "body2": "FF0000", "rightarm2": "FF0000", "shorts2": "000000", "socks2": "FF0000", "website": "http://www.clydefc.co.uk/"}, "wikidata": {"instance of (P31)": "association football club (Q476028)", "home venue (P115)": ["Broadwood Stadium (Q922974)", "Shawfield Stadium (Q7491246)", "Barrowfield Park (Q21003846)"], "league (P118)": ["Scottish Football League Third Division (Q1394554)", "Scottish Football League (Q2261276)"], "head coach (P286)": "Jim Duffy (Q2778121)", "Commons category (P373)": "Clyde F.C.", "topic's main category (P910)": "Category:Clyde F.C.

Formed in 1877 at the River Clyde in Glasgow, the club host their home matches at New Douglas Park, having played at Broadwood Stadium from 1994 until 2022. Their biggest accomplishment was winning the Scottish Cup on three occasions: 1939, 1955 and 1958; they reached the final a further three times, all during a long period based at Shawfield. They have not played in the top division of Scottish football since 1975.\nThe team are currently managed by Danny Lennon, who was appointed in November 2017.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 1877\u20131898 ===\nThe Clyde Football Club was founded and played on the banks of the River Clyde at Barrowfield. Documentary evidence from the SFA and indeed match reports in the Glasgow press clearly show it all began in 1877, and the thread continues unbroken to this day.\nHere's how the SFA recorded Clyde's origins:\n\n\"Clyde:- Founded 1877; Membership 50; Grounds (private), Barrowfield Park, on the banks of the Clyde; ten minutes walk from Bridgeton Cross; Club House on grounds; Colours, White & Blue. Hon. Secretary, John D. Graham, 24 Monteith Row.\"\nSitting on the edge of Bridgeton, Barrowfield Park lay in a triangle of land enclosed by Carstairs Street, Colvend Street and the river Clyde. The area was an intense mix of chemical, engineering and textile work with a high population density to provide the labour. Although no stadium photographs have emerged, it appears the ground consisted of a grandstand running north\u2013south, a pavilion and tennis courts at the southern end and a bicycle track surrounding the pitch.\nToday this area is dotted with industrial units, but also contains a large grassed area, so it may be possible to stand upon a corner of the original Barrowfield pitch. Barrowfield got initially shared with a short-lived team called Albatross.\nThe club founded then has no resemblance to a modern professional football club. Clyde F.C. was a private members club more akin to a present-day golf or bowling club. Clyde's Secretary, John Graham, was also a noted rower and it seems the club had other sporting and cultural activities besides football.\nThe first mention of Clyde was in Monday's Evening Times of 17 September 1877:\n\n\"Clyde v T. Lanark\nClyde opened their season at Barrowfield with a match against the 3rd Lanark Volunteers. In the end, the 3rd were victors by three goals to 1.\"\nThis concise report was typical at the time as the sport was of little significance and football competed with racing, bowling and quoting for the limited column space available.\nAlthough most fixtures were informal, the Scottish Cup had existed since 1873. Soon there would also be the Glasgow Merchants Charity Cup and the Glasgow Cup which in their time were hotly contested major competitions. Clyde entered the 1st Round of the Scottish Cup on 29 September 1877 along with one hundred and one other teams. Third Lanark were the visitors once again, and triumphed 1\u20130.\nOn 6 March 1883, the Glasgow Football Association was established (formed to compete with the older - 1877 - rival Edinburgh Association), with Clyde one of the six clubs represented at that first meeting. The club are one of only three founding members clubs still in existence today (with Queen's Park and Rangers).Clyde joined the Scottish Football League in 1891, its second edition. Following acceptance, Vale of Leven provided the opposition for Clyde's first League fixture on Saturday, 15 August 1891. In a dream introduction to the format Clyde triumphed 10\u20133, and a mid-table finish saw the club complete a confident season in League football. While it was an undoubted success, Barrowfield revealed its limitations and could not cope with the crowds as many gained illegal entry. Opposition teams complained about the facilities, and it was clear that Clyde would have to do something to appease the League.\nThe club had the pitch dug up in the off season in 1893 to have the clayey surface replaced by ashes to lend additional facilities to the draining powers of the field.The club enjoyed cup success in local competitions as the 19th century drew to a close. The team won the North Eastern Cup and Graham Cup four times apiece. Both tournaments featured teams from the East End of Glasgow. However, Clyde endured a terrible final season at Barrowfield, finishing bottom of Division 1 with only 5 points, but remained in the top division. The last action at Barrowfield was a friendly against crack opposition in the form of Sunderland on 30 April 1898, ending in a 3\u20133 draw.\n\n\n=== 1899\u20131919 ===\nThe club left Barrowfield in 1898 and purchased some open ground (Shawfield) directly across the river  between the Glasgow neighbourhood of Oatlands and the Lanarkshire town of Rutherglen. The move was largely financed by the club becoming incorporated and issuing shares in \"The Clyde Football Club Limited\". On the eve of a new season, Clyde F.C. Ltd had an enclosed area of about 9 acres (3.6 ha). A grandstand seating of 1500 was nearing completion and embankment works around the pitch were well underway.\n\nLocal rivals Celtic provided the first opposition at Shawfield Stadium on 27 August 1898. An attendance of 10,000 witnessed a goalless draw and return gate receipts of \u00a3203. The 1899\u20131900 season saw the team relegated by finishing bottom of top division.They were Division Two champions in 1904\u201305 (and runners up in 1903\u201304 and 1905\u201306), but there was no promotion until the latter second-place finish. Automatic promotion and relegation was not established until 1921. The following seasons up to World War I would be far more successful and represented the most consistent period of success for the club.From 1908 to 1913, Clyde were at the top end of Division One and reached the Scottish Cup final in 1910 and 1912. The team placed third in 1908\u201309 (three points behind champions Celtic) and in 1911\u201312 and reached further semi finals (in 1908\u201309 and 1912\u201313).The 1910 final was a bitter disappointment. For 83 minutes Clyde (McTurk; Watson & Blair; Walker, McAteer & Robertson; Stirling & McCartney; Chalmers; Jackson & Booth) held a 2\u20130 lead (Chalmers and Booth both scored). However, Robertson fluffed a clearance off Blair and into his own net. Dundee then netted a last minute equalizer from Langlands. The replay was far more cagey and ended goalless after extra time, but with Dundee looking physically stronger. Chalmers struck after three minutes to give Clyde a 1\u20130 lead in the third match. Dundee equalized before half time, and as Clyde looked jaded, John Hunter won the cup for Dundee. The 1912 final was a 2\u20130 defeat to Celtic.International honours were awarded to Clyde for the first time in March 1909, as William Walker represented Scotland against club mate Jack Kirwan of Ireland at Ibrox (5\u20130 to Scotland). The Glasgow Charity Cup (in 1910) and Glasgow Cup (in 1914) were won for the first time. Both were highly prestigious competitions before European football was introduced. All six clubs (Celtic, Clyde, Partick Thistle, Queen's Park, Rangers and Third Lanark) were more often than not resident in Division One.In September 1914, a fire destroyed the grandstand, and with it much of the club's early history. After the war broke out in November 1914, the Scottish League would continue playing. Many players signed up for 'King & Country' \u2013 some never returned, such as C. Clunas (2nd Royal Fusiliers), T. Cranston (Black Watch) and W. Sharp (1st Battalion Royal Scots) \u2013 and teams like Clyde found it increasingly difficult to field competitive sides  and the League eventually reduced back to a single division.\n\n\n=== 1920\u20131945 ===\nThe club had managed to sustain football through the war years, but the Scottish League continued through 1919\u201321 with only one division. Division Two restarted in 1921\u201322, with automatic promotion and relegation adopted. Benefits were evident for ambitious teams, but the financial penalties for falling out of the top tier were extremely severe.Relegated in 1923\u201324, Clyde spent two seasons playing teams like Armadale, Arthurlie, Bathgate, Bo'ness, Broxburn, and King's Park until promotion (and another Glasgow Cup) in 1925\u201326. From 1926 to 1939, Clyde remained a Division One club, as the team maintained a respectable mid-table status. International honours returned to Shawfield, as Danny Blair was a prominent Scotland full back of this era and leading goalscorer Billy Boyd (with 32 goals in 1932\u201333) earned two international caps.Liquidation was narrowly averted in 1930. Greyhound racing was booming in the 1920s and many clubs used this a way to supplement their income. A company offered to lease Shawfield in 1926 and also give a percentage of the gate money to Clyde, but animal racing was forbidden in the deeds of Shawfield and the League was dead set against the sport in general. Chairman John McMahon would not let go of the idea. After years of wrangling, the Shawfield Greyhound Racing Company Ltd started racing in 1932 and a few years later purchased the stadium from Clyde.The team conceded a solitary goal on the run to the 1939 Scottish Cup final. Clean sheets were kept against St Johnstone (2\u20130), Dundee (0\u20130 at Dens Park, followed by 1\u20130 in a replay), city rivals Third Lanark (1\u20130), and the Hibernian semi final match (1\u20130 at Tynecastle). The single goal against came at Rangers in the 3rd Round, where prolific centre forward Willie Martin set a record for an opposition at Ibrox by scoring all four goals in a 4\u20131 win.Clyde (Brown; Kirk and Hickie; Beaton, Falloon and Weir; Robertson and Gillies; Martin; Noble and Wallace) faced Motherwell, who had scored the most goals on route to the final, in front of 94,000 at Hampden on 22 April 1939. After losing the coin toss, Clyde goalkeeper Brown was under the most pressure early on. Assisted by a Robertson delivery, Wallace fired the opener in the roof of the net. Despite further opposition pressure before the interval, Martin doubled the lead with an opportunistic strike after the break. Late goals from Noble (netting from a rebound) and Martin (assisted by Noble for his second) sealed an emphatic 4\u20130 win and a maiden Scottish Cup triumph.War with Nazi Germany caused the suspension of the Scottish League in 1939\u201340, and all players' contracts declared void. Unofficial competitions soon restarted with an East/West regional split. The geographical separation meant Clyde were placed in the Southern League. Runners up behind champions Rangers in 1940\u201341 (by three points), the team would continue to perform relatively well in warttime competitions.A second major cup competition, the Scottish League Cup would be inaugurated in 1946. It was the then Clyde and SFL chairman John McMahon who donated the trophy that is still awarded to the winners of the competition to this day.\n\n\n=== 1946\u20131969 ===\nThe club ventured on a 20-match tour of South Africa in 1947 and recorded 16 wins, 2 draws and 2 defeats. Also in 1953, future Ballon d'Or winner Stanley Matthews (and Blackpool teammate Ernie Taylor) turned out for Clyde against Everton in a benefit match at Celtic Park in Belfast.Leslie Johnston, a then Scotland internationalist, twice broke the Scottish transfer record as a Clyde player in the 1940s.\nThe team showed steady league form just after the war and reached a fourth Scottish Cup final in 1948\u201349. In only the fourth edition of the competition since Clyde won it in 1938\u201339, their opponents Rangers ran out comfortable 4\u20131 winners in front of a crowd of 108,000 at Hampden, with Peter Galletly scoring Clyde's consolation goal. It was claimed that both Rangers penalties were of a dubious nature.The 1950s began with relegation from Division A in 1950\u201351, but returned as Division B champions in 1951\u201352. The team repeated the feat in 1955\u201356 and 1956\u201357. Each occasion saw the team bounce back to solid finishes in Division A. Floodlighting was introduced at Shawfield in March 1954. The first opposition was Huddersfield Town in a friendly match. Huddersfield won 3\u20132. Domestic cup success came readily in the 1950s. They won the Scottish Cup in 1954\u201355 and 1957\u201358 and were beaten semi-finalists in 1955\u201356 and 1959\u201360. They also reached Scottish League Cup semi-finals in 1956\u201357 and 1957\u201358, but lost on both occasions to Celtic.The route to the 1954\u201355 Final began with three straight home victories in the competition against Albion Rovers (3\u20130), Raith Rovers (3\u20131) and Falkirk (5\u20130). Aberdeen provided Clyde's semi-final opponents. After a 2\u20132 draw at Easter Road, a solitary goal in the replay sent Clyde into the final. On 23 April 1955 at Hampden in front of over 96,000, Celtic, installed as firm favourites, provided the opposition in the final, in a match that was also the first to be televised live. Without forward McPhail and goalkeeper Wilson, Clyde lined up:- Hewkins, Murphy & Haddock; Granville, Anderson & Laing; Divers & Robertson; Hill; Brown & Ring. Celtic held a 1\u20130 lead with three minutes left until Robertson scored direct from a corner kick to earn a replay. A crowd of over 68,000 gathered for the replay, with the same Clyde line up, a Tommy Ring goal was enough to win a more open affair.The first half of the League Cup tie with Aberdeen at Shawfield on September 3, 1955, was also televised live (a competition first) by the BBC as an experiment.Back at Hampden on 26 April 1958 in front of a crowd of 94,000 to face a strong Hibernian team, Clyde lined up:- McCulloch, Murphy & Haddock; Walters, Finlay & Clinton; Herd & Currie; Coyle; Robertson & Ring. A deflected strike from Coyle in poor conditions gave Clyde a 1\u20130 win and a second Scottish Cup in four seasons and third overall. Fourth place in the final league table and another League Cup semi-final spot completed an impressive season in 1957\u201358. Haddock, Robertson and Coyle were confirmed in the final Scotland squad for the 1958 FIFA World Cup. Dan Currie was selected in the provisional squad, but did not make the final cut.Clyde gained entry into the Friendship Cup in 1960. It was an inter-League competition between four clubs each from England, France and Scotland, with results aggregated to provide the 'best' League. It proved to be an unpopular format and ended in 1962. For the record, Clyde was drawn against RC Lens of Ligue 1 and beat them 4\u20130 away and 2\u20131 at Shawfield. The club began the 1960s as a yo-yo club. Relegations in 1960\u201361 and 1962\u201363 were followed by immediate promotions in 1961\u201362 and 1963\u201364, the former as Division Two champions.At home to Celtic on September 10, 1966, the Clyde team unusually started the match with squad numbers instead of the traditional (1\u201311) positional numbers on their shirts. The team actually returned from the interval with the routine numbering of 1\u201311.The 1966\u201367 season led Clyde to their highest league finish in forty-five years and another Scottish Cup semi-final appearance. Competing largely as a part-time team, Clyde finished third behind the Old Firm clubs. After producing a wonderful season of football that has marked the high tide in the club's fortunes to date, European football will forever love denying itself. The Inter-Cities Fairs Cup had a rule that stipulated only one team per city could enter. Clyde argued that they were not from Glasgow; they were from Rutherglen. However UEFA denied this argument citing Clyde's non-membership of the Lanarkshire FA and their participation in the Glasgow Cup. Rangers had that position. Another League Cup semi-final was reached in 1968\u201369. The club journeyed on a 10-match tour of Rhodesia in 1969 and remained unbeaten (9 wins and 1 draw).As the 1960s came to a close, Clyde was competing rather comfortably in the top division. It was a different story on the terraces with Glasgow's slum clearance programme hitting attendances hard. Large swathes of housing in Bridgeton, Dalmarnock, Gorbals, Oatlands and Rutherglen were being demolished with the inhabitants decanted away to other parts of the city and beyond. Clyde's core support was drawn from these areas, and many of them have never returned to follow the team.\n\n\n=== 1970\u20131993 ===\nThe club began the 1970s as in previous decades, with the threat of relegation of hanging around. In an attempt to quit the city, there was an attempted merger with Hamilton Academical, who were in dire financial trouble and had resigned from the Scottish League. After the move floundered as quickly as it arose, Hamilton quickly rejoined the League. Less than a year later, Dumbarton of Division Two made an audacious bid to merge with Clyde in Division One at the time in return for a cash settlement. The Scottish League quickly quashed the move, after viewing it as Dumbarton trying to gain back-door entry into the top division.After relegation in 1971\u201372, many club legends such as Harry Glasgow, Sam Hastings, Tommy McCulloch, Graham McFarlane and Eddie Mulheron moved on. Clyde did recover and won promotion as Division Two champions in 1972\u201373. Two years in the top division until another relegation in 1974\u201375 would be their last in the top division to date. The Premier Division was introduced ahead of the season 1975\u201376 as the new top division, with inclusion based upon league position. A poor 16th-place finish in Division One in season 1974\u201375 meant Clyde was never in contention. The club now found themselves back in the second tier, now known as the First Division.The club found a new role, discovering and developing talent before selling it on. Shawfield was the starting point for future Scotland internationalists like Steve Archibald, Ian Ferguson and Pat Nevin. Problems on and off the pitch saw Clyde move into freefall. After finishing bottom of the First Division in 1975\u201376, they found themselves in the Second Division, the third tier, for the season 1976\u201377. They only could muster a seventh-place finish. In a decade Clyde had gone from the third best team in Scotland to a single spot above the finishing last in the Scottish football league system. Towards the end of the season, Celtic legend Billy McNeill took charge but left for Aberdeen after only a few months at the helm. The club then turned to the relatively unknown Craig Brown, and he had immediate success as the team won the Second Division in 1977\u201378.Problems were arising at Shawfield. The stadium was falling into a state of disrepair, and the grounds were not well maintained. By the late 1970s, Shawfield came into the hands of the Greyhound Racing Association (GRA). Greyhound racing had been in decline since 1963 when off-course betting was allowed. To compensate for this, the GRA had transformed itself into a property company and had a policy of acquiring and redeveloping dog tracks for commercial and residential uses.They became the first Scottish club to adopt a shirt sponsor in 1979\u201380. The club secured a deal with the British Oxygen Company. As a guest of the SFA, Fabio Capello worked with manager Craig Brown and the team at Shawfield for a short stint in the early 1980s when he started coaching.Relegation from the First Division in 1979\u201380 was followed by another promotion as Second Division champions in 1981\u201382. Shawfield eventually came on the open market in 1983 with a \u00a3500,000 price tag. The club was served with a notice to quit Shawfield by 1986. Alloa Athletic provided the final opposition at Shawfield on 28 April 1986. Clyde claimed a 4\u20132 win. The unpopular but necessary decision was taken to ground-share with city rivals Partick Thistle. Clyde spent five unhappy seasons at Firhill, and there was a sense of relief when Clyde departed. The club was grateful for the use of Firhill, but there was an underlying sense of being tolerated as an inconvenient annoyance.The 'Gypsy Army' reference came into being as Clyde supporters sought pride and solace during the club's homeless years. The club then negotiated a ground-share at Douglas Park with Hamilton Academical, where Clyde resided for two and a half seasons as plans were developed and implemented to build a new home in Cumbernauld. Meanwhile, on the field, relegation from the First Division in 1990\u201391, was followed by promotion again as Second Division champions in 1992\u201393 and an immediate relegation in 1993\u201394.  However, this continued the tradition of the yo-yo existence the club had become known for at certain times in previous decades.\n\n\n=== 1994\u2013present ===\nThe Cumbernauld Development Corporation was keen to have a sports stadium and professional football team to promote the town, and Cumbernauld, with a 50,000+ population, seemed fertile ground on which to grow new support. A new site called \"Broadwood\" was to have an integrated business, housing and leisure development with a football stadium at the heart of it. With the help of Football Trust backing, two modern stands began to emerge during the early 1990s.\nThe Scottish League unusually granted permission for Clyde to switch grounds mid-season, and former landlords, Hamilton Academical, were the inaugural opposition on 5 February 1994. A capacity crowd of 6000 watched as Clyde lost to the Accies 2\u20130.\nClyde dropped to the third tier of football, and in 1998 they almost fell into the lowest reaches of Senior football. However, this was enough for the new chairman, Billy Carmichael, to introduce changes. Ronnie MacDonald got appointed as manager, having worked at Maryhill Juniors. MacDonald signed a whole squad from the Junior ranks, and within two seasons Clyde had gained promotion.  Subsequently, Allan Maitland won promotion to the Scottish First Division in 1999.\nThe 2003\u201304 season saw Clyde atop the League and looking set for the SPL. But Broadwood did not comply with SPL requirements and crucially Clyde was on the brink of being petitioned by their creditors and liquidated. While the chairman's fortune was well spent on players' wages, very little else got serviced. The SPL relented and said Clyde could join them if the fourth stand got built. North Lanarkshire Council started the groundworks and then abruptly halted them as they became aware of Clyde's financial plight. Plan B, playing at Kilmarnock, was investigated.  In the event, a draw with Ayr United and a home loss to Inverness Caledonian Thistle meant that Clyde missed out on promotion.\nThe Clyde Supporters' Trust formed during the 2003\u201304 season. Early that season some concerned fans met knowing that the chairman could not keep financing the Club indefinitely.  The timing of the Trust's formation coincided with Clyde's failure to gain promotion, and the chairman sought to sell his majority shareholding. Following lengthy negotiations, a consortium of the Trust and traditional investors increased the majority shareholding for a nominal sum. The Clyde Development Consortium took control of funds gathered by fans and investors and used it to finance the Club through a CVA to clear the debts. In June 2005 the CVA was completed, and Clyde was mostly debt free.\nIn a season, 2005\u201306, that saw Clyde lead 2\u20131 from 1\u20130 behind at Rangers in a League Cup tie with 17 minutes left before a goalkeeping error gifted Rangers an equalizer, with Clyde going on to lose in extra time, the other half of the Old Firm, Celtic visited Broadwood in the Scottish Cup on 8 January 2006. Celtic were such heavy favourites that the game was presented as a gentle introduction for their new signing, Roy Keane. Clyde, however, won 2\u20131. The goal scorers for Clyde were Eddie Malone and Craig Bryson whilst Celtic's goal scorer was Maciej Zurawski. Clyde reached the 2006 Challenge Cup Final, their first final for 48 years, since their Scottish Cup success in 1958. They lost the game 5\u20134 on a penalty shootout, after the game finished 1\u20131 following extra time.Former Scotland captain Colin Hendry was appointed manager in summer 2007. On 14 August of that year, Clyde history was made when Michael Doherty became the youngest person ever to play for Clyde in a competitive match, a feat later broken by Connor Stevenson in a league match at Palmerston on 25 April 2009.Hendry resigned in January 2008, due to family reasons. Former Rangers defender John 'Bomber' Brown replaced him as manager. Clyde entered the final game of the season needing to better Morton's result to avoid getting forced into the playoffs. Clyde won their game 3\u20130, but in a cruel twist of fate, Morton won their own game by the same scoreline, sending Clyde into a two-legged play-off with Second Division side Alloa Athletic. Clyde lost the first leg 2\u20131 and at 3\u20131 down in the home second leg looked as good as relegated. However, a thrilling fightback saw Clyde level at 5\u20135 on aggregate (4\u20133 on the day) before adding another goal in extra time to progress. Home and away victories over Airdrie United in the play-off final then secured First Division football at Broadwood for another season.\nHowever, the following season Clyde finished bottom of the First Division and got relegated to the Second Division. Meanwhile, off the park, financial problems were once again apparent. In a hope to try and avoid administration in June 2009, Clyde terminated the contracts of the entire first-team squad, with only youngsters remaining under contract at the club. The squad for 2009\u201310 was rebuilt on a drastically reduced budget with a repeat of open trials which were successful in 2005. However early results were not good, and the board appointed Neil Watt as Director of Football and John McCormack as first team coach. After a brief upturn in results, Clyde went six games without a win, and on Saturday 21 November, with the team sitting three points adrift at the bottom of the Second Division, it was announced that John Brown had left his position as manager. On Monday 5 April John McCormack was sacked by Clyde.More history was made in a home match with Peterhead on 17 April 2010, when Willie Sawyers scored after only eight seconds, which became the fastest Clyde goal ever recorded. Despite this, the club was subsequently relegated for the second season in a row, dropping down to the Third Division where they made a disastrous start to the campaign, including an 8\u20131 thrashing at the hands of Montrose. On Wednesday 2 February 2011, Stuart Millar was sacked as manager of Clyde. They finished 10th in the Third Division, which at 42nd and last place overall is the lowest position in the Scottish league system.\nOn 20 April 2013 Clyde's owners voted to move to East Kilbride and rename the club EK Clyde FC, however this plan would later be abandoned. The 2013\u201314 season saw a significant improvement on the field when a League One play-off spot was secured in the penultimate league match of the season. In the previous six seasons Clyde had finished in the bottom two positions of every league campaign. However, the club missed out on promotion after a play-off semi-final defeat on penalties to East Fife. Gordon Young became the first Clyde player to score with their first touch on their club debut in a match against Elgin City on 1 March 2014.Duffy resigned as manager of Clyde on 19 May 2014 to take up the vacant managerial post at Greenock Morton, while John Taylor, a member of the boardroom since 1986, and the club's longest serving director had stepped down in April. In October 2014, the club were declared officially debt free, having accumulated an unsustainable debt of \u00a31.4 million as a result of the club's failed promotion bid to the SPL during season 2003\u201304, with the burden of debt having weighed heavily on the shoulders of the club for the next decade. Scott Durie became the first Clyde player to play every single minute of every competitive match in a season, during the 2014\u201315 season.Former Rangers, Blackburn and Scotland midfielder Barry Ferguson was appointed as player-manager of Clyde in June 2014 and took the club to a 6th-place finish in his first season in charge. Ferguson officially retired as a player towards the end of that season. The following year, Clyde finished 3rd in League Two but got beaten in the playoff final. On 25 February 2017 with the club in 8th place in League Two after a 1\u20130 defeat to Annan Athletic and with no realistic prospect of gaining promotion after a ten-match winless run, Ferguson resigned as manager of Clyde, with his assistant Bob Malcolm taking interim charge of the side until a new manager was appointed.After nine years in the bottom tier of Scottish football, at the end of the 2018\u201319 season, Danny Lennon led Clyde to promotion to Scottish League One, beating Annan Athletic 2\u20131 on aggregate to win the promotion play-off final.\n\n\n== Grounds ==\n\n\n=== Barrowfield ===\nClyde has had five home grounds since they formed in 1877. The first of these was Barrowfield Park, situated on the banks of the River Clyde between the Glasgow neighbourhoods of Bridgeton and Dalmarnock.\n\n\n=== Shawfield ===\n\nBy 1898, Barrowfield became too small in capacity to deal with the large crowds of spectators. The club then moved across the river to build a new stadium, which would be known as Shawfield Stadium.\nA crowd of 10,000 saw the first match at Shawfield against Celtic. In 1908, a group of 52,000 gathered for a game against Rangers, which remains Clyde's record home attendance to this day. Financial pressures led to the club relinquishing ownership of the stadium in 1935, selling it their former tenants, the Greyhound Racing Association. This arrangement continued satisfactorily for over 50 years until the GRA announced redevelopment plans for the stadium and gave Clyde notice to quit in 1986.\n\n\n=== Broadwood ===\n\nIn 1990, Clyde had secured an agreement to move into a stadium in the new town of Cumbernauld, which due to shifting population patterns was by now one of the larger settlements in Scotland without a senior football team. The new all-seater Broadwood Stadium would not be ready until 1994.\nClyde moved into the venue midway through the 1994\u201395 season. Broadwood has hosted Scotland U21 matches and four Scottish Challenge Cup finals in the past. Broadwood was also home to Airdrieonians for four seasons from 1994 to 1998 and Rangers reserves for a while.\nOn 9 December 2010, Clyde had informed their landlords at North Lanarkshire Council (NL Leisure) of their intention to relinquish their lease on Broadwood and move elsewhere. Furthermore, on 19 October 2011, Clyde revealed that they were investigating the possibility of a move to East Kilbride, the largest town in Scotland without a senior football team. Another option was to move back to Rutherglen and develop the Clyde Gateway Stadium in a ground-sharing agreement. This had received approval from current tenants Rutherglen Glencairn.In April 2022, the club announced they would be leaving Broadwood at the end of the 2021\u201322 season, ending their 28-year stay in Cumbernauld. They will be ground-sharing with Hamilton Academical at New Douglas Park from the start of the 2022\u201323 season, with a view of relocating to a new home back in Glasgow in the near future.\n\n\n=== Groundsharing ===\n\nAfter the Great War began, in September 1914, a fire completely destroyed the grandstand at Shawfield. Clyde were forced to switch their home games for a while. Celtic, the club's East End neighbours, offered up  Celtic Park as an alternative venue for home games.After Celtic Park suffered similar damage in March 1929, The club had to play the rest of their matches in the 1928\u201329 season at nearby Shawfield. (reciprocating an earlier arrangement in 1914 when Clyde suffered similar damage to their ground).On March 1, 1958, Clyde hosted Celtic in the Scottish Cup. Set for Shawfield, the match was moved to Celtic Park over safety concerns. However, Clyde still had home advantage because the home stand tickets were initially reserved for Clyde ticket holders with Celtic tickets ineligible. The Bully Wee won 2\u20130 in front of 65,000, with goals from Ring and Currie. The full back pairing of Haddock and Murphy were reported to have been immense.\n\nAfter quitting Shawfield in 1986, the club investigated several local options. Clyde secured an agreement with arch-rivals Partick Thistle to share their ground Firhill for five seasons until 1991. Despite reaching an agreement to move into Broadwood in 1990, it would not be until 1994 when the ground was ready, so Clyde shared with Hamilton Accies at their Douglas Park for a further three seasons.\n\nThe club negotiated a groundshare with Alloa to use Recreation Park for the club's first home game of the 2012\u201313 season, a first round Challenge Cup match against Partick Thistle. During pre-season work had begun at Broadwood to replace the grass pitch with an artificial surface (astroturf) and the pitch was not finished in time for their first home match of the season. Clyde were confident that the pitch would be completed and all the details finalised for the club's first home league match of the season in time for the visit of Peterhead. The match was switched to Recreation Park for the second successive home game after a pitch inspection carried out earlier in the week by the SFL decided that the pitch was not at the stage of completion as expected. Installation of the new surface was completed in time for the club's next home match of the league season.\n\n\n== Supporters ==\nClyde Football Club is 100% owned by the supporters.The supporters' fiercest rivalry is with Partick Thistle, given that the two clubs are both of smaller stature to that of Rangers and Celtic. However, given the success and promotion of Partick Thistle to the Scottish Premiership, and Clyde's recent relegation to the Scottish League Two, such derby games have become a rarity in past years. Both clubs are in League One together in the 2020\u201321 season.\nThe number of years Clyde spent without a permanent home of their own led to the fans identifying themselves as the Gypsy Army.\nThe Clyde Supporters Social Club on Rutherglen Main Street burned down in the early 2000s and has never been rebuilt or re-opened. There was also a Supporters Club located in Kirkintilloch.The Clyde Supporters' Trust got formed during season 2003\u201304. A group of fans became aware of the club's severe financial problems as Billy Carmichael's reign as chairman came to an end. It was formed in time to save the club and keep it in the supporter's hands in a time that coincided with Clyde's failure to gain promotion and the chairman looking to sell his majority shareholding.In the past the Supporters' Trust has financed the signings of players such as John Potter and Tom Brighton, and retaining the signatures of players such as Neil McGregor and David Hutton.\nThe Clyde supporters also run their own supporters team called Bully Wee United. Bully Wee United are recognised as the official supporters team of Clyde and represent the club in the IFA League with matches well played Saturday mornings. Matches are normally against the supporter's teams of the opposition facing the first team on the same day. Bully Wee United is unique in most Scottish supporters teams as they operate a strict policy that only Clyde supporters may play for the team. Players must attend a minimum number of Clyde games over a season. Clyde is also represented in the Scottish Central Amateur League by another supporters team named Broadwood Clyde. They got formed in 1994. They were crowned SSFL Division One league champions in 2005. They also won the SSFL League Cup in 2004 and SSFL Inter-Division Cup in 2003 making them the most successful Clyde supporters team. Broadwood Clyde play their homes games at Ravenswood in Cumbernauld on Sunday afternoons.\n\n\n=== The Clyde View ===\nThe Clyde View is Clyde's official matchday programme. It won the Scottish Programme of the Year Award every season from 1995\u201396 to 2006\u201307, and again in 2008\u201309. It also won the Scottish Divisional Programme of the Year Award every season from 1991\u201392 to 2011\u201312. It won the inaugural Scottish Divisional Programme Best Design of the Year Award for season 2011\u201312.On Wirrel's UK Programme of the Year, it achieved a top ten finish on three consecutive occasions from 2002\u201303 to 2004\u201305; 8th (2002\u201303), 6th (2003\u201304) and 5th (2004\u201305).\n\n\n== Nickname ==\nThe club's nickname, \"The Bully Wee\", is of uncertain origin although the club themselves have advanced three theories.The first suggests that the clubs and supporters and perhaps players mainly came from Bridgeton, Glasgow, a tight working-class area whose inhabitants had a reputation as \"wee bullies\", with this becoming transposed as the Bully Wee.\nAlternatively, it is also claimed that it comes from around 1900 when a group of French supporters paid a visit to Barrowfield and, upon the scoring of a disputed goal, were heard to remark  \"But il'y, oui?\" or \"Their goal, yes\". Supporters heard this unfamiliar phrase as \"Bully Wee\", and the name stuck.\nFinally the third theory, and the one accepted by the club as the most plausible, links the term to the old Victorian idiom \"bully\" meaning first-rate or high standard and suggests that Clyde, a small club, would have been regularly referred to as \"Bully Wee Clyde\", with the first two words eventually becoming the standalone nickname.\nClyde's supporters also go by the name of \"Gypsy Army\". Due to the number of years the club spent homeless, rival fans called Clyde fans \"gypsies\" as a slur. The supporters of Clyde adopted this as a badge of honour and the \"Gypsy Army\" was born. Despite now having a settled home at Broadwood Stadium the nickname lives on in terracing songs, supporters buses and supporters football teams.\n\n\n== Rivalries ==\nHistorically seen as a Glasgow club, local rivalries (Glasgow derby) were developed and forged with other teams from in and around the city, in particular Celtic (also from the East End), Rangers, Partick Thistle and Queen's Park and the now-defunct Third Lanark.For most of the 20th century, they were six of leading clubs in the country. More often than not all six clubs reside in the top division, with fiercely contested competitions such as the Glasgow Cup and Glasgow Charity Cup (before European football) on top of national tournaments, it saw the clubs pitted against one another multiple times a season.A team called Thistle FC, also known Glasgow or Bridgeton Thistle, were early rivals to the club. Formed a decade before Clyde in 1868, Thistle's first ground was situated nearby at the club's original home Barrowfield Park. Thistle's last fixture was a friendly against the full first team of Clyde at Barrowfield before going out of existence in 1894.The Clyde vs Partick Thistle derby was previously a fierce battle between two of Glasgow's smaller clubs, in comparison to the Old Firm. The rivalry intensified when Thistle became Clyde's landlords at Firhill for five years in the 1980s. The decision to groundshare was never fully accepted by either set of fans. After quitting Clyde on free transfer to sign for the Firhill club (newly promoted to the SPL) in 2002, Jamie Mitchell stated he was shocked by the reaction of Clyde supporters to the move. He referred to it as getting the \"Mo Johnston treatment\". Former Jags midfielder Scott Chaplain (once a signing target for Clyde) spoke of the \"competitive edges to those particular matches\" after playing in the fixtures many times. When talking about a possible groundshare again, Partick Thistle chairman David Beattie said it would reignite the Glasgow-rivalry saying \"the healthy rivalry between ourselves and the Bully Wee is historical\". Due to Partick Thistle's promotion to Scotland's highest professional league, the Scottish Premiership, in the 2010s and Clyde's relegations to the lower leagues in the same period, matches between the two clubs became less common. However, by 2020 they found themselves in the same division (Scottish League One) once again, with a revived version of the Glasgow Cup also offering more meetings.\nDuring the 2010s, Queen's Park became the natural rivals to Clyde, as both clubs were stuck in the bottom league (fourth tier) for the majority of the decade. From 2010 to 2016, Clyde were on a demoralising run of results against Queen's Park: the Spiders won 17 and drew 3 of the 26 matches. This included a run of 11 successive wins (scoring 29 goals in that run).Geographically classed as a North Lanarkshire club since the 1994 move to Cumbernauld, Clyde's matches against Airdrieonians, Albion Rovers, Motherwell or Hamilton Academical can be considered a Lanarkshire derby. In recent times, a rivalry developed with Hamilton.\n\n\n== Managers ==\n\n\n== First-team squad ==\nAs of 6 May 2022Note: Flags indicate national team as defined under FIFA eligibility rules.

The club won the Reserve League Cup for the first time in May 2008. They defeated Livingston 4\u20131 on their own ground at Almondvale with Dave McKay scoring all four goals for Clyde. It was the team's first piece of silverware at reserve level for twenty years. The following season the club were knocked out by Ross County in the semi-finals losing 3\u20130 in Dingwall.\n\n\n=== Reserve team history ===\n\n\n==== 'A' Team ====\nIt was common from the beginning of reserve football for the majority of club's reserve teams (second XI's) to go by the tag \u2018A\u2019 or sometimes \u2018B\u2019 or even \u2018C\u2019 if a club had more than one reserve side. It wasn't until after the formation of the new Scottish Reserve League in 1955 that today's reserve teams go by the actual tag \u2018reserves\u2019 and have done since 1957.During the 1881\u201382 season, Clyde reached the semi-finals of the Scottish 2nd XI Cup in the competitions the first season. In 1896-97 they reached their first 'major' cup final, the Scottish 2nd XI Cup final eventually losing 4\u20130 to Hearts. After reaching the semi-finals again in 1905\u201306, they were thwarted by arch-rivals Partick Thistle this time.\nThe club first joined the Scottish Reserve League in 1909-10 and found the first few years of competing in the league though. It wasn't until the 1913\u201314 season when they made their mark when they lost 1\u20130 at Hearts in a league decider for the Reserve League title. It meant that the club missed out on a unique League and Cup double after they captured the Scottish 2nd XI Cup for the first time that season. They dispatched of St Mirren  in the final over two legs (1-1 away and 3\u20131 at home). They successfully defended the Scottish 2nd XI Cup the following season when Clyde overcame Falkirk in the final over two legs (2-1 loss away and a 3\u20131 home win).\nTheir third and final Scottish 2nd XI Cup triumph came in 1941\u201342. It would be the team's last 'major' cup success for the next sixty-six years. In 1945-46 they reached their last Scottish 2nd XI Cup final losing to Hibs, after a superb 6-2 derby victory over arch-rivals Partick Thistle in the semifinals.The Scottish Reserve League merged with the Scottish C Division (third tier) for the 1949\u201350 season creating two regionalised divisions (South/West and North/East) with Clyde entering a reserve team in the South & West region. The club was crowned champions in 1949\u201350 and they retained their title in 1950\u201351. Despite successive titles, there was no promotion as only first teams could gain promotion to Division B. As reserve teams got excluded from the Scottish League Cup, the C Division had their League Cup. Clyde couldn't quite match the success in the cup that they had in the league as they never won the competition. The best they could manage were semi-final appearances in 1951-52 and in 1953\u201354.\n\n\n==== League restructuring ====\nAfter both regional C Divisions got scrapped in June 1955, a new Scottish Reserve League started up. The new Reserve League was an exclusively all First Division league (a mirror image of the senior league) and all Second Division clubs' reserve sides got excluded from joining. There were several seasons when not all clubs took part. As for teams who were turned away or excluded from joining, they joined various supplementary leagues over the next few years.\nFor the first few seasons between 1955 and 1960, Clyde regularly finished quite high up the table or at least in a mid-table position. From then onwards in the seasons they spent in the league, the team were often at the wrong end of the table.\nIn one of the seasons that Clyde didn't participate in the Reserve League, they joined the Combined Reserve League for a single season in 1961\u201362. Due to the small number of teams involved, the competition got split into an Autumn Series and Spring Series. The club won the Autumn Series and finished second overall in the Combined Table.\nJust like Clyde's first team, whose last spell in the Scottish top flight came in 1974\u201375, the same fate happened to their reserve team following a further league restructure at senior and reserve level. The Reserve League set-up changed again in 1975 after a reorganisation of the 'senior' Scottish League into Premier-First-Second Divisions. The new Premier Reserve League was a mirror image of the new Scottish Premier Division in terms of membership. Lower league clubs used varying set-ups such as east\u2013west sections and midweek competitions. In later games, clubs didn't always participate as running a reserve side became expensive.\nIt wasn't until season 1979\u201380 when Clyde gained membership to re-enter a reserve team in the Scottish Reserve League. They got placed in the regional West division. Finishing bottom in their first season, it was a further two seasons before they returned. They fared much better during the 1987\u201388 season when they won the division. It proved to be a one-off, though. Season 2000\u201301 was Clyde's last in the West Reserves League eventually before all reserves leagues got scrapped after season 2007\u201308.\n\n\n=== Youth teams ===\nThe club ran youth teams at under-20, under-17, under-15, under-14, under-13, under-12, and under-11 level. There was an under-18 team until 2003, when it made way for under-17 and under-19 teams. The under-20 team replaced the under-19 team in 2014. The club also run Football Schools in Cumbernauld (since 2006) and Glasgow Southside (since 2008). Both schools have since been awarded the SFA Quality Mark Award at Standard Level and then at Development Level.The Community Foundation received the Gold award in the SFA Quality Mark category for grassroots football. The Foundation also received the Young Start Award in 2017 to run a project called Start Young, Grow Young. The club were forced to scrap their youth academy from under 11 to under 17 levels in 2015 citing a reduction in funding from the Scottish FA, with the under-20 side the only youth team remaining, which acts as a feeder to the first team for young players.The team reached the Scottish Youth Cup semi finals in 1988, but were beaten by Dunfermline Athletic. The under-17 team reached the SFL Youth Cup final in 2004 losing 4\u20131 on penalties to Hamilton Accies at New Douglas Park despite scoring in stoppage time of extra time to make it 1\u20131. Both of the under-19 and under-17 teams reached the semi finals of their SFL Youth Cups in 2006. The under-19 team finished runners-up behind Celtic in the inaugural SPFL under-19 league in 2014.The under-19 team travelled to the Netherlands in 2003, taking part in a highly rated youth football programme called the Leonardo Project hosted by FC Dordrecht. They played three times against an under-19 team of the hosts, which contained Dutch youth internationalists, winning two and drawing one. In the third match, the opposition was made up of reserves and first team fringe players. They followed this up with a win over local amateur team vv Capelle and a narrow defeat to a youthful FC Utrecht team.The Lanarkshire FA started the Lanarkshire Supercounty Trophy for all four senior Lanarkshire clubs' under-17 teams in 2013. Clyde beat Motherwell in the semi final, but lost to Accies in the final. The under-17's also reached their sectional League Cup final in 2017. The Community Foundation youth teams reached Divisional Cup finals in 2018 and 2019.From the 2018\u201319 season, Clyde have replaced their Under 20 side with a project alongside North Lanarkshire Council called Project Braver, which will see young players play at youth level with a chance to progress to the first team, alongside providing further education or apprenticeship opportunities for the players.\n\n\n==== Graduates ====\nGraduates of the youth team who have gone on to play for the first team since moving to Broadwood Stadium include:\n\nScottish internationals Pat Nevin, Steve Archibald and Ian Ferguson also came through the Clyde youth system.\n\n\n== Hall of Fame ==\n\nThe club launched its official Hall of Fame in 2011, with five inaugural inductees. Three more were inducted in 2012. The Clyde team of season 1966\u201367 was inducted in 2014. There was one inducted in 2015.

The club was admitted to the Scottish Football League and renamed as Meadowbank Thistle in 1974, and played its matches at Meadowbank Stadium in Edinburgh. In 1995, the club was relocated to Livingston, West Lothian and renamed after the town. Since then Livingston have played their home games at Almondvale Stadium. In the ten years following the move to Livingston the club enjoyed notable success, winning promotion to the Scottish Premier League in 2001, qualifying for the UEFA Cup in its maiden season in the top flight (finishing third behind Celtic and Rangers) and winning the 2004 Scottish League Cup. However, the club hit financial problems in 2004, and was relegated to the Scottish First Division in 2006. In July 2009 the club faced further financial problems and were on the verge of suffering a liquidation event before a deal was struck. Livingston were subsequently demoted to the Scottish Third Division, but the club achieved consecutive promotions and went on to regain its place in the top tier after winning the 2017\u201318 Scottish Premiership play-offs.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Ferranti Thistle (1943\u20131974) ===\nThe club began life as Ferranti Amateurs in 1943. A works team of the Ferranti engineering company, they initially played in the Edinburgh FA's Amateur Second Division. In 1948 the club became known as Ferranti Thistle and began competing in the Edinburgh and District Welfare Association where they competed for five seasons, before moving to senior football in 1953 joining the East of Scotland League. During this period the club won the East of Scotland Qualifying Cup in 1963.  In 1969 the club moved to the City Park ground in Edinburgh.In 1972 the club became members of SFA which allowed them to enter the Scottish Qualifying Cup which they won in 1973 which previously had not been open to them. The club's first match in the Scottish Cup was on 16 December 1972 against Duns.In 1974, as a result of the demise of Third Lanark seven years earlier, and the new three-tier format of the Scottish Football League, a place opened up in the second division of the competition. After beating off competition from four Highland League sides, Hawick Royal Albert and Gateshead United, Ferranti Thistle were accepted into the league by a vote of 21\u201316 over Inverness Thistle. The club faced a number of obstacles before they could join the Division as their name did not meet stringent SFL rules on overt sponsorship of teams at the time and the City Ground was not up to standard. The local council offered use of Meadowbank Stadium, a modern stadium built in 1970. After an Edinburgh Evening News campaign to find a name for the club, the name Meadowbank Thistle was chosen. This was approved by the SFL in time for the new season.\n\n\n=== Meadowbank Thistle (1974\u20131995) ===\n Having had little time to form a squad from the existing Ferranti squad, the first Meadowbank Thistle manager John Bain faced an uphill task to produce a competitive squad in time for the new season. Meadowbank played their first competitive match in the League Cup, eventually losing 1\u20130 to Albion Rovers. In 1983 the club achieved promotion to the First Division but ultimately were relegated back to the Second Division at the end of the 1984\u201385 season.In the 1986\u201387 season, Meadowbank won the Second Division championship and won promotion to the First Division. They finished runners-up in the First Division in the following season, but were denied promotion to the Premier Division due to league reconstruction.The part-time club began to struggle, and it became a limited company in 1993 but was relegated a short time after at the end of the 1992\u201393 season to the Second Division. Meadowbank suffered a second relegation in 1994\u201395, finishing second from bottom in the Second Division and due to the creation of a Third Division were relegated. After this, Chairman Bill Hunter claimed Meadowbank had run into severe financial difficulties and were facing closure as a result. In the face of significant opposition from many Meadowbank fans who objected to the dropping of the club name and the team moving from Edinburgh, in 1995 Meadowbank Thistle relocated to a new stadium in the new town of Livingston and changed name again, to Livingston Football Club.\n\n\n=== Livingston (1995\u2013) ===\n\n\n==== Rise to prominence ====\nIn their first season as Livingston they were crowned champions of the Third Division for the 1995\u201396 season. Three years later, in 1998\u201399, they won promotion again as Second Division champions. Another promotion followed in 2000\u201301 when the club finished champions of First Division and gained promotion to the Scottish Premier League (SPL), just six seasons after the relocation to Livingston. Livingston's first SPL campaign, 2001\u201302, brought more success as they finished third in the league (behind the Old Firm) and qualified for the UEFA Cup for the first time. Jim Leishman's side gave a competent showing in the UEFA Cup. After disposing of FC Vaduz of Liechtenstein on the away goal rule after a 1\u20131 draw, they came up against SK Sturm Graz of Austria, and after a 14-goal, two-leg affair they missed out on the second round, going out on the wrong side of an 8\u20136 aggregate scoreline. The club avoided relegation the following season finishing 9th. After this season, manager Jim Leishman became the club's director of football and was replaced by Brazilian manager M\u00e1rcio M\u00e1ximo, who resigned only a few months into the following campaign and was in turn replaced by Leishman's former assistant, Davie Hay. Under Hay's management, Livingston won their first national trophy in 2004 by winning the 2003\u201304 League Cup after a 2\u20130 win over Hibernian at Hampden Park. The goals in the final were scored by Derek Lilley and Jamie McAllister.\n\n\n==== Administration and SPL relegation ====\nThe club's rise was short-lived as they were plunged into administration on 3 February 2004. It was 13 May 2005 before Livingston emerged from administration, following a period of financial turmoil in which the previous boardroom occupants were ousted to make way for Pearse Flynn's Lionheart Consortium. Flynn's first decision was to sack Davie Hay, stating that he wanted a younger man in charge, and to that end appointed Allan Preston as the club's new manager. While Preston's term as Livingston manager started brightly with a 3\u20130 win over newly promoted Inverness Caledonian Thistle, the club failed to win another league game under his management, resulting in his dismissal in November with the club rooted to the bottom of the SPL. Richard Gough succeeded Preston and steered the club to survival on the last day of the season with a 1\u20131 draw with Dundee that relegated Dundee in their place, but Gough refused to stay as manager past the end of that season due to family problems and returned to the US, and former Celtic player Paul Lambert succeeded him. On 11 February 2006, Lambert resigned as Livingston manager after seven straight defeats leaving Livingston bottom of the Scottish Premier League. He was replaced by former player and coach John Robertson. Despite his best efforts, Livingston were relegated for the first time in May 2006 after only picking up 18 points that season. It was the worst record since the SPL began and was only beaten during the 2007\u201308 season by Gretna, after they were deducted 10 points for going into administration.\n\n\n==== First Division and second administration ====\nA poor showing in the 2006\u201307 First Division saw John Robertson removed as Livingston manager on 15 April 2007. His successor was announced on 22 May 2007 as former Hibernian assistant coach Mark Proctor. Proctor appointed Curtis Fleming as his assistant on 26 June 2007, but both were sacked in June 2008 after a disappointing season in which they finished seventh. Livingston were taken over that summer by Italian majority shareholders Angelo Massone, Tommaso Bruno, Alessandro Di Mattia, and Tommaso Angelini after Pearse Flynn sold his shares in June 2008. The Italians were thought to be close to appointing fellow Italian Roberto Landi as head coach in June and he was made manager of the First Division side on 11 June 2008. He and assistant Valter Berlini were then fired on 1 December 2008 after just five months in charge. Paul Hegarty was linked with the job on 3 December 2008, and formally appointed two days later. Hegarty was subsequently suspended as manager on 26 April 2009 and his contract allowed to expire.John Murphy was appointed head coach on 30 June 2009, the same day the club faced a deadline to pay debt to West Lothian Council who owned Almondvale Stadium. After that was not met, legal proceedings were carried out against the club to come to an arrangement over the debt within fourteen days or potentially face again going into administration. Livingston were placed into administration on 24 July 2009 by the Court of Session in Edinburgh, and faced relegation to the Third Division, a points deduction or being removed from the Scottish Football League entirely.\nOn 27 July 2009, it was revealed that the club were likely to go into liquidation after owner Angelo Massone said he would refuse a \u00a325,000 offer for the club from their administrator. On 28 July 2009, Massone yet again refused the offer and the administrator subsequently started the liquidation process. While Livingston seemed doomed, a meeting with the Scottish Football League on 30 July 2009 secured their future, as they agreed to allow prospective new owners Gordon McDougall and Neil Rankine (part of the Livingston 5 Consortium) to run the club for the following season. The next day, Massone sold his shares to the new owners and left the club, and it was also announced that John Murphy had been appointed back to his previous role as goalkeeping coach, with ex-player Gary Bollan becoming the club's new manager. In the first game after the new owners took over, Livingston were on the wrong end of a cup shock in the Scottish League Cup first round, losing 3\u20130 to Albion Rovers, a team two divisions below them.\n\n\n==== Demotion to the Third Division ====\nDespite the prospective new owners ensuring that Livingston's future as a professional football club would be secure for the next year at least by paying a \u00a3720,000 bond to the SFL, on 5 August 2009 the Scottish Football League took the unprecedented move to demote Livingston to the Third Division. A breach of rules on insolvency was the main reason behind the decision. The administrator of the club, Donald McGruther, admitted his concern after the decision, saying that \"In my view, this represents the death knell of Livingston Football Club\". Gordon McDougall, a member of the Livingston 5 Consortium stated that \"We've got to consider all the options that are open to us \u2013 it makes it very, very difficult\". It was feared that the club could not survive in the Third Division due to a significant loss of revenue. However, despite the decision and the likely financial impacts, the consortium continued with their bid to take over the club. An appeal was lodged and as a result the club refused to play their opening Division Three fixture against East Stirlingshire on 8 August 2009. Because of this, the club were threatened with a points deduction, but in the event they were given a \u00a33,000 fine for their actions. This was later overturned on appeal, meaning that the club ultimately escaped any punishment for their boycott of the match. On 7 September 2009 a further appeal to the SFA was dismissed, and the club finally accepted their Third Division fate.\n\n\n==== Title wins and First Division return ====\nOn 15 August 2009, Livingston opened their Third Division campaign against Montrose at home and ran out comfortable 2\u20130 winners. On 17 April 2010, Livingston won the Scottish Third Division title after drawing 0\u20130 at home to Berwick Rangers. Goalkeeper Roddy McKenzie saved a last minute penalty to ensure the title was on its way to Almondvale. The Lions ended the season on 78 points, 15 points ahead of second placed Forfar Athletic. The following season on 9 April 2011, Livingston secured the Second Division title with a second consecutive title win to earn promotion back to the Scottish First Division with a 3\u20130 victory over Stenhousemuir at Ochilview Park. On 9 February 2012, Bollan was sacked as manager after two and a half years in charge. Nine days later on 14 February 2012, John Hughes and John Collins were appointed as manager and director of football respectively. However, on 13 November 2012, it was announced that Hughes had left the club to take charge of Hartlepool United. Gareth Evans became manager after being promoted from his position as assistant manager but he was sacked on 28 February 2013 due to \u2018concerns over his stewardship\u2019. Collins subsequently resigned from his position as director of football. On 25 March 2013, Richie Burke was appointed as manager along with Mark Burchill as assistant manager. Livingston ended season 2012\u201313 with a 4th-place finish in the First Division, their highest league finish since they were relegated from the SPL in 2006. On 12 September 2013, Burke resigned from his post as manager and was subsequently replaced by John McGlynn. When McGlynn took over Livingston were bottom of the Scottish Championship with only 1 point. Improved performances under his leadership took the club into contention for the promotion play-offs. As a result he was awarded an extended contract in January 2014. Livingston eventually finished in 6th place in 2013\u201314.\nHowever Livingston struggled the following season and were in severe danger of relegation. McGlynn left Livingston by mutual consent in December 2014, following a 1\u20130 home defeat by Falkirk, which left the club bottom of the league, four points behind second bottom Cowdenbeath. Mark Burchill replaced McGlynn as the club's manager. Off the field problems also once again plagued the club during this season. The club were deducted 5 points by the SPFL for failing to pay tax on bonuses paid during the 2010\u201311 season. Former club director Ged Nixon tried to get the courts to freeze the clubs bank accounts as he claimed the club owed him \u00a3300,000. This sparked fears that the club would go into administration for a third time. Nixon lost his court case in April 2015, saving the club from this fate. Livingston won the 2014\u201315 Scottish Challenge Cup, defeating Alloa 4-0 in the final at McDiarmid Park. With two games of the season remaining Livingston were still adrift at the bottom of the league, three points behind relegation rivals Alloa and four behind Cowdenbeath. A 4\u20130 win away at Raith Rovers moved the club into 9th place on goal difference going into the final game of the season. Livingston won their final game of the season 1\u20130 at home to Queen of the South to pull off the great escape and finish in 8th place, avoiding both automatic relegation and the relegation play-off.Livingston were struggling against relegation again in season 2015\u201316. Burchill was sacked in December 2015 following a 1\u20131 draw with Dumbarton as Livingston sat second bottom of the league. David Hopkin replaced him as manager. However there was to be no great escape this season. Livingston finished in 9th place in the Championship, which meant they had to contest the Championship Play-Off to avoid relegation to Scottish League One. They faced Stranraer in the play-off semi-final. Livingston lost the first leg 5\u20132 away at Stranraer, giving themselves a very difficult task for the second leg. In the second leg Livingston won 4\u20131 in 90 minutes to take the tie to extra time. However two extra time Stranraer goals took the score to 4\u20133 on the day and 6\u20138 on aggregate, confirming Livingston's relegation to League One, ending a five year stint in the second tier.\n\n\n==== League One and consecutive promotions ====\nDespite relegation, Livingston decided to stay as a full-time football club, and David Hopkin was retained as manager for the 2016\u201317 season, as Livingston aimed to bounce back to the Championship. Livingston went on to win the league comfortably and secured the title in April 2017 following a 2\u20131 win at home to Alloa Athletic. Livingston finished 19 points clear at the top of the league.\nLivingston continued this impressive form into the Championship in 2017\u201318 and sat in the play-off places in joint 3rd in the league after 20 games. The club also reached the quarter-finals of the Scottish League Cup, where they were unlucky to go down 3\u20132 at Hibernian. It was the first time they reached this stage of the league cup since 2005\u201306.\nOn 21 April 2018 Livingston secured second place in the Championship after a 3\u20130 win over already relegated Brechin City.\nQualifying for the Premiership play-off final, they faced Partick Thistle, who escaped automatic relegation in their final game. Despite this, Livingston won 3\u20131 on aggregate, 2\u20131 at home and 1\u20130 away, earning the final place in the Scottish Premiership and their first season of top-flight football since 2006, relegating Partick Thistle to the Championship in the process, ending Thistle's five-year stint in the Premiership.\n\n\n==== Scottish Premiership ====\nLivingston retained their status as a top flight club in season 2018\u201319 with a 9th place finish. This was bettered the following season with the club sitting in 5th before the season was curtailed as a result of COVID-19. The points per game ruling confirmed this placing as Livi's first top 6 finish since 2001\u201302. In 2020-21, the feat was repeated with a sixth place finish. The season was also notable for the club reaching the Scottish League Cup final for the first time since 2004.\n\n\n== Colours and badge ==\nThe predominant club colours are amber and black, which have been used since the formation of the club in 1943. The strip typically has an amber top, with the shorts normally black and the socks amber, usually with some black detail. The original strip for the club during the first couple of season in the Ferranti Thistle era was amber and black hoops. After this, solid amber shirts, black shorts and amber socks (occasionally black) became established as the club's home kit. During the recent Livingston era the club have also used all black home strips, and a white and orange kit was used during 2002\u201303 season. The colours of white, black, purple, blue and red have been mainly used in the away strips.The badge used to identify the club has changed four times in the club's history. The Ferranti Thistle badge featured a black circular base. Three symbols were incorporated into the badge; a football, a thistle and a lion rampant in the centre holding aloft a Scottish flag. A new badge was then formed as the club changed their name to Meadowbank Thistle. The badge was based on a traditional shield shape with a black being the predominant colour and amber on the outer-trim. The badge features a thistle as the centre piece, with the flower part of the plant being replaced with a football. As the club moved to Livingston, the badge was changed again. The design of the thistle and the football is altered slightly; with the one major change being the addition of a Latin club motto \"Fortitier omnia vincit\" with the English translation meaning \"Bravely conquers all\". The current badge is modernised from the original Livingston badge but most of the features remain. The present badge also reintroduced the lion rampant in the centre of the laurel.\n\n\n== Sponsorship ==\nIn the Meadowbank Thistle era between 1973 and 1995, the club sourced various shirt sponsorship deals largely from small business such as Ferranti, Sports Conscious, Park & Milton, Raj Restaurant, ACA and PAR Scaffolding. Mitsubishi became the first major shirt sponsor of the club for the first three seasons of the Livingston era. Motorola then sponsored the club for the next four years. However, Motorola withdrew their shirt sponsorship at the end of the 2001\u201302 season, after the company\u2019s decline in the area. In 2002, Intelligent Finance, one of the largest employers in the West Lothian area, agreed an initial two-year sponsorship deal with the club worth an undisclosed six-figure sum. The company extended their shirt sponsorship for three more years, making their total sponsorship span over a five-year period.Smarter Loans became the club's main sponsor during the 2007\u201308 season, before the IT solutions company, RDF, signed a two-year deal to become main sponsors for seasons 2008\u201309 and 2009\u201310. However they withdrew their sponsorship after only one year, as a result of the ongoing financial crisis at the club that summer. Local supply chain solutions company Fasteq became the new main sponsor for season 2009\u201310 after the arrival of the new club owners. After four successful years as sponsors, Fasteq withdrew their sponsorship and Livingston announced that they were looking for new shirt sponsors for season 2013\u201314. Local business  Energy Assets were confirmed as new main sponsors on a three-year deal in June 2013.\n\n\n== Stadiums ==\n\nThe club have had three main grounds in their history; as Ferranti Thistle, the club initially played in local parks before finding a home at City Park in Edinburgh in 1969, then moving to Meadowbank Stadium in 1974 which was built for the 1970 Commonwealth Games.Livingston currently play their home games at the Almondvale Stadium in Livingston. It is currently known as the Tony Macaroni Arena due to a sponsorship deal. The 9,512 capacity stadium was constructed in 1995 as a joint venture between Meadowbank Thistle and the Livingston Development Corporation (LDC). Part of the deal involved the relocation of Meadowbank Thistle to the town and a name change to Livingston. When the LDC was wound up, ownership of the Stadium was transferred to West Lothian Council and the council have since rented the stadium to the club. The ground has hosted Scotland under-21, under-19, under-17s and Ladies matches, as well as one home game for Gretna due to problems with their ground share at Fir Park. In April 2011 it was revealed that it was possible Livingston would relocate to a new stadium around one mile from the current site due to West Lothian Council looking to sell the current site to a supermarket chain.\n\n\n== Players ==\n\n\n=== First-team squad ===\nAs of 31 January 2022Note: Flags indicate national team as defined under FIFA eligibility rules.

They have qualified for a UEFA club competition on one occasion. The club finished third in the Scottish Premier League (behind Celtic and Rangers) in season 2001\u201302 and hence qualified for a place in the UEFA Cup for the following season. They entered at the qualifying round stage and were drawn against FC Vaduz of Liechtenstein. Livingston narrowly overcame their opponents after drawing 1\u20131 on aggregate, going through to the next round on the away goals rule. After drawing the home leg 0\u20130 Oscar Rubio scored the decisive away goal. In the following round they were drawn against Austrian side SK Sturm Graz. They were defeated 8\u20136 on aggregate, losing the first leg 5\u20132 in Austria at the Arnold Schwarzenegger Stadium before winning the return leg 4\u20133 at Almondvale. Barry Wilson scored two goals against Sturm Graz, making him Livingston\u2019s highest goalscorer in European competitions to date.\n\n\n== See also ==\nRelocation of professional sports teams\nWorks team\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nLivi for Life Supporters Trust", "infobox": {"clubname": "Livingston", "image": "Livingston FC club badge new.png", "upright": ".8", "fullname": "Livingston Football Club", "nickname": "Livi, The Lions", "founded": "{{Start date and age|df|=|yes|1943}} (as Ferranti Thistle)", "ground": "[[Almondvale Stadium]], [[Livingston, West Lothian|Livingston]]", "capacity": "9,512", "owner": "Opcco6 Ltd", "chairman": "Robert Wilson", "manager": "[[David Martindale]]", "league": "{{Scottish football updater|Livingst}}", "season": "{{Scottish football updater|Livingst2}}", "position": "{{Scottish football updater|Livingst3}}", "pattern_b1": "_livingston2122h", "leftarm1": "000000", "body1": "000000", "rightarm1": "000000", "shorts1": "000000", "socks1": "000000", "pattern_b2": "_livingston2122a", "website": "https://livingstonfc.co.uk", "current": "2021\u201322 Livingston F.C. season"}, "wikidata": {"instance of (P31)": "association football club (Q476028)", "home venue (P115)": "Almondvale Stadium (Q1309785)", "league (P118)": ["Scottish Championship (Q14468438)", "Scottish Premiership (Q14377162)"], "topic's main category (P910)": "Category:Livingston F.C.

The club was admitted to the Scottish Football League and renamed as Meadowbank Thistle in 1974, and played its matches at Meadowbank Stadium in Edinburgh. In 1995, the club was relocated to Livingston, West Lothian and renamed after the town. Since then Livingston have played their home games at Almondvale Stadium. In the ten years following the move to Livingston the club enjoyed notable success, winning promotion to the Scottish Premier League in 2001, qualifying for the UEFA Cup in its maiden season in the top flight (finishing third behind Celtic and Rangers) and winning the 2004 Scottish League Cup. However, the club hit financial problems in 2004, and was relegated to the Scottish First Division in 2006. In July 2009 the club faced further financial problems and were on the verge of suffering a liquidation event before a deal was struck. Livingston were subsequently demoted to the Scottish Third Division, but the club achieved consecutive promotions and went on to regain its place in the top tier after winning the 2017\u201318 Scottish Premiership play-offs.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Ferranti Thistle (1943\u20131974) ===\nThe club began life as Ferranti Amateurs in 1943. A works team of the Ferranti engineering company, they initially played in the Edinburgh FA's Amateur Second Division. In 1948 the club became known as Ferranti Thistle and began competing in the Edinburgh and District Welfare Association where they competed for five seasons, before moving to senior football in 1953 joining the East of Scotland League. During this period the club won the East of Scotland Qualifying Cup in 1963.  In 1969 the club moved to the City Park ground in Edinburgh.In 1972 the club became members of SFA which allowed them to enter the Scottish Qualifying Cup which they won in 1973 which previously had not been open to them. The club's first match in the Scottish Cup was on 16 December 1972 against Duns.In 1974, as a result of the demise of Third Lanark seven years earlier, and the new three-tier format of the Scottish Football League, a place opened up in the second division of the competition. After beating off competition from four Highland League sides, Hawick Royal Albert and Gateshead United, Ferranti Thistle were accepted into the league by a vote of 21\u201316 over Inverness Thistle. The club faced a number of obstacles before they could join the Division as their name did not meet stringent SFL rules on overt sponsorship of teams at the time and the City Ground was not up to standard. The local council offered use of Meadowbank Stadium, a modern stadium built in 1970. After an Edinburgh Evening News campaign to find a name for the club, the name Meadowbank Thistle was chosen. This was approved by the SFL in time for the new season.\n\n\n=== Meadowbank Thistle (1974\u20131995) ===\n Having had little time to form a squad from the existing Ferranti squad, the first Meadowbank Thistle manager John Bain faced an uphill task to produce a competitive squad in time for the new season. Meadowbank played their first competitive match in the League Cup, eventually losing 1\u20130 to Albion Rovers. In 1983 the club achieved promotion to the First Division but ultimately were relegated back to the Second Division at the end of the 1984\u201385 season.In the 1986\u201387 season, Meadowbank won the Second Division championship and won promotion to the First Division. They finished runners-up in the First Division in the following season, but were denied promotion to the Premier Division due to league reconstruction.The part-time club began to struggle, and it became a limited company in 1993 but was relegated a short time after at the end of the 1992\u201393 season to the Second Division. Meadowbank suffered a second relegation in 1994\u201395, finishing second from bottom in the Second Division and due to the creation of a Third Division were relegated. After this, Chairman Bill Hunter claimed Meadowbank had run into severe financial difficulties and were facing closure as a result. In the face of significant opposition from many Meadowbank fans who objected to the dropping of the club name and the team moving from Edinburgh, in 1995 Meadowbank Thistle relocated to a new stadium in the new town of Livingston and changed name again, to Livingston Football Club.\n\n\n=== Livingston (1995\u2013) ===\n\n\n==== Rise to prominence ====\nIn their first season as Livingston they were crowned champions of the Third Division for the 1995\u201396 season. Three years later, in 1998\u201399, they won promotion again as Second Division champions. Another promotion followed in 2000\u201301 when the club finished champions of First Division and gained promotion to the Scottish Premier League (SPL), just six seasons after the relocation to Livingston. Livingston's first SPL campaign, 2001\u201302, brought more success as they finished third in the league (behind the Old Firm) and qualified for the UEFA Cup for the first time. Jim Leishman's side gave a competent showing in the UEFA Cup. After disposing of FC Vaduz of Liechtenstein on the away goal rule after a 1\u20131 draw, they came up against SK Sturm Graz of Austria, and after a 14-goal, two-leg affair they missed out on the second round, going out on the wrong side of an 8\u20136 aggregate scoreline. The club avoided relegation the following season finishing 9th. After this season, manager Jim Leishman became the club's director of football and was replaced by Brazilian manager M\u00e1rcio M\u00e1ximo, who resigned only a few months into the following campaign and was in turn replaced by Leishman's former assistant, Davie Hay. Under Hay's management, Livingston won their first national trophy in 2004 by winning the 2003\u201304 League Cup after a 2\u20130 win over Hibernian at Hampden Park. The goals in the final were scored by Derek Lilley and Jamie McAllister.\n\n\n==== Administration and SPL relegation ====\nThe club's rise was short-lived as they were plunged into administration on 3 February 2004. It was 13 May 2005 before Livingston emerged from administration, following a period of financial turmoil in which the previous boardroom occupants were ousted to make way for Pearse Flynn's Lionheart Consortium. Flynn's first decision was to sack Davie Hay, stating that he wanted a younger man in charge, and to that end appointed Allan Preston as the club's new manager. While Preston's term as Livingston manager started brightly with a 3\u20130 win over newly promoted Inverness Caledonian Thistle, the club failed to win another league game under his management, resulting in his dismissal in November with the club rooted to the bottom of the SPL. Richard Gough succeeded Preston and steered the club to survival on the last day of the season with a 1\u20131 draw with Dundee that relegated Dundee in their place, but Gough refused to stay as manager past the end of that season due to family problems and returned to the US, and former Celtic player Paul Lambert succeeded him. On 11 February 2006, Lambert resigned as Livingston manager after seven straight defeats leaving Livingston bottom of the Scottish Premier League. He was replaced by former player and coach John Robertson. Despite his best efforts, Livingston were relegated for the first time in May 2006 after only picking up 18 points that season. It was the worst record since the SPL began and was only beaten during the 2007\u201308 season by Gretna, after they were deducted 10 points for going into administration.\n\n\n==== First Division and second administration ====\nA poor showing in the 2006\u201307 First Division saw John Robertson removed as Livingston manager on 15 April 2007. His successor was announced on 22 May 2007 as former Hibernian assistant coach Mark Proctor. Proctor appointed Curtis Fleming as his assistant on 26 June 2007, but both were sacked in June 2008 after a disappointing season in which they finished seventh. Livingston were taken over that summer by Italian majority shareholders Angelo Massone, Tommaso Bruno, Alessandro Di Mattia, and Tommaso Angelini after Pearse Flynn sold his shares in June 2008. The Italians were thought to be close to appointing fellow Italian Roberto Landi as head coach in June and he was made manager of the First Division side on 11 June 2008. He and assistant Valter Berlini were then fired on 1 December 2008 after just five months in charge. Paul Hegarty was linked with the job on 3 December 2008, and formally appointed two days later. Hegarty was subsequently suspended as manager on 26 April 2009 and his contract allowed to expire.John Murphy was appointed head coach on 30 June 2009, the same day the club faced a deadline to pay debt to West Lothian Council who owned Almondvale Stadium. After that was not met, legal proceedings were carried out against the club to come to an arrangement over the debt within fourteen days or potentially face again going into administration. Livingston were placed into administration on 24 July 2009 by the Court of Session in Edinburgh, and faced relegation to the Third Division, a points deduction or being removed from the Scottish Football League entirely.\nOn 27 July 2009, it was revealed that the club were likely to go into liquidation after owner Angelo Massone said he would refuse a \u00a325,000 offer for the club from their administrator. On 28 July 2009, Massone yet again refused the offer and the administrator subsequently started the liquidation process. While Livingston seemed doomed, a meeting with the Scottish Football League on 30 July 2009 secured their future, as they agreed to allow prospective new owners Gordon McDougall and Neil Rankine (part of the Livingston 5 Consortium) to run the club for the following season. The next day, Massone sold his shares to the new owners and left the club, and it was also announced that John Murphy had been appointed back to his previous role as goalkeeping coach, with ex-player Gary Bollan becoming the club's new manager. In the first game after the new owners took over, Livingston were on the wrong end of a cup shock in the Scottish League Cup first round, losing 3\u20130 to Albion Rovers, a team two divisions below them.\n\n\n==== Demotion to the Third Division ====\nDespite the prospective new owners ensuring that Livingston's future as a professional football club would be secure for the next year at least by paying a \u00a3720,000 bond to the SFL, on 5 August 2009 the Scottish Football League took the unprecedented move to demote Livingston to the Third Division. A breach of rules on insolvency was the main reason behind the decision. The administrator of the club, Donald McGruther, admitted his concern after the decision, saying that \"In my view, this represents the death knell of Livingston Football Club\". Gordon McDougall, a member of the Livingston 5 Consortium stated that \"We've got to consider all the options that are open to us \u2013 it makes it very, very difficult\". It was feared that the club could not survive in the Third Division due to a significant loss of revenue. However, despite the decision and the likely financial impacts, the consortium continued with their bid to take over the club. An appeal was lodged and as a result the club refused to play their opening Division Three fixture against East Stirlingshire on 8 August 2009. Because of this, the club were threatened with a points deduction, but in the event they were given a \u00a33,000 fine for their actions. This was later overturned on appeal, meaning that the club ultimately escaped any punishment for their boycott of the match. On 7 September 2009 a further appeal to the SFA was dismissed, and the club finally accepted their Third Division fate.\n\n\n==== Title wins and First Division return ====\nOn 15 August 2009, Livingston opened their Third Division campaign against Montrose at home and ran out comfortable 2\u20130 winners. On 17 April 2010, Livingston won the Scottish Third Division title after drawing 0\u20130 at home to Berwick Rangers. Goalkeeper Roddy McKenzie saved a last minute penalty to ensure the title was on its way to Almondvale. The Lions ended the season on 78 points, 15 points ahead of second placed Forfar Athletic. The following season on 9 April 2011, Livingston secured the Second Division title with a second consecutive title win to earn promotion back to the Scottish First Division with a 3\u20130 victory over Stenhousemuir at Ochilview Park. On 9 February 2012, Bollan was sacked as manager after two and a half years in charge. Nine days later on 14 February 2012, John Hughes and John Collins were appointed as manager and director of football respectively. However, on 13 November 2012, it was announced that Hughes had left the club to take charge of Hartlepool United. Gareth Evans became manager after being promoted from his position as assistant manager but he was sacked on 28 February 2013 due to \u2018concerns over his stewardship\u2019. Collins subsequently resigned from his position as director of football. On 25 March 2013, Richie Burke was appointed as manager along with Mark Burchill as assistant manager. Livingston ended season 2012\u201313 with a 4th-place finish in the First Division, their highest league finish since they were relegated from the SPL in 2006. On 12 September 2013, Burke resigned from his post as manager and was subsequently replaced by John McGlynn. When McGlynn took over Livingston were bottom of the Scottish Championship with only 1 point. Improved performances under his leadership took the club into contention for the promotion play-offs. As a result he was awarded an extended contract in January 2014. Livingston eventually finished in 6th place in 2013\u201314.\nHowever Livingston struggled the following season and were in severe danger of relegation. McGlynn left Livingston by mutual consent in December 2014, following a 1\u20130 home defeat by Falkirk, which left the club bottom of the league, four points behind second bottom Cowdenbeath. Mark Burchill replaced McGlynn as the club's manager. Off the field problems also once again plagued the club during this season. The club were deducted 5 points by the SPFL for failing to pay tax on bonuses paid during the 2010\u201311 season. Former club director Ged Nixon tried to get the courts to freeze the clubs bank accounts as he claimed the club owed him \u00a3300,000. This sparked fears that the club would go into administration for a third time. Nixon lost his court case in April 2015, saving the club from this fate. Livingston won the 2014\u201315 Scottish Challenge Cup, defeating Alloa 4-0 in the final at McDiarmid Park. With two games of the season remaining Livingston were still adrift at the bottom of the league, three points behind relegation rivals Alloa and four behind Cowdenbeath. A 4\u20130 win away at Raith Rovers moved the club into 9th place on goal difference going into the final game of the season. Livingston won their final game of the season 1\u20130 at home to Queen of the South to pull off the great escape and finish in 8th place, avoiding both automatic relegation and the relegation play-off.Livingston were struggling against relegation again in season 2015\u201316. Burchill was sacked in December 2015 following a 1\u20131 draw with Dumbarton as Livingston sat second bottom of the league. David Hopkin replaced him as manager. However there was to be no great escape this season. Livingston finished in 9th place in the Championship, which meant they had to contest the Championship Play-Off to avoid relegation to Scottish League One. They faced Stranraer in the play-off semi-final. Livingston lost the first leg 5\u20132 away at Stranraer, giving themselves a very difficult task for the second leg. In the second leg Livingston won 4\u20131 in 90 minutes to take the tie to extra time. However two extra time Stranraer goals took the score to 4\u20133 on the day and 6\u20138 on aggregate, confirming Livingston's relegation to League One, ending a five year stint in the second tier.\n\n\n==== League One and consecutive promotions ====\nDespite relegation, Livingston decided to stay as a full-time football club, and David Hopkin was retained as manager for the 2016\u201317 season, as Livingston aimed to bounce back to the Championship. Livingston went on to win the league comfortably and secured the title in April 2017 following a 2\u20131 win at home to Alloa Athletic. Livingston finished 19 points clear at the top of the league.\nLivingston continued this impressive form into the Championship in 2017\u201318 and sat in the play-off places in joint 3rd in the league after 20 games. The club also reached the quarter-finals of the Scottish League Cup, where they were unlucky to go down 3\u20132 at Hibernian. It was the first time they reached this stage of the league cup since 2005\u201306.\nOn 21 April 2018 Livingston secured second place in the Championship after a 3\u20130 win over already relegated Brechin City.\nQualifying for the Premiership play-off final, they faced Partick Thistle, who escaped automatic relegation in their final game. Despite this, Livingston won 3\u20131 on aggregate, 2\u20131 at home and 1\u20130 away, earning the final place in the Scottish Premiership and their first season of top-flight football since 2006, relegating Partick Thistle to the Championship in the process, ending Thistle's five-year stint in the Premiership.\n\n\n==== Scottish Premiership ====\nLivingston retained their status as a top flight club in season 2018\u201319 with a 9th place finish. This was bettered the following season with the club sitting in 5th before the season was curtailed as a result of COVID-19. The points per game ruling confirmed this placing as Livi's first top 6 finish since 2001\u201302. In 2020-21, the feat was repeated with a sixth place finish. The season was also notable for the club reaching the Scottish League Cup final for the first time since 2004.\n\n\n== Colours and badge ==\nThe predominant club colours are amber and black, which have been used since the formation of the club in 1943. The strip typically has an amber top, with the shorts normally black and the socks amber, usually with some black detail. The original strip for the club during the first couple of season in the Ferranti Thistle era was amber and black hoops. After this, solid amber shirts, black shorts and amber socks (occasionally black) became established as the club's home kit. During the recent Livingston era the club have also used all black home strips, and a white and orange kit was used during 2002\u201303 season. The colours of white, black, purple, blue and red have been mainly used in the away strips.The badge used to identify the club has changed four times in the club's history. The Ferranti Thistle badge featured a black circular base. Three symbols were incorporated into the badge; a football, a thistle and a lion rampant in the centre holding aloft a Scottish flag. A new badge was then formed as the club changed their name to Meadowbank Thistle. The badge was based on a traditional shield shape with a black being the predominant colour and amber on the outer-trim. The badge features a thistle as the centre piece, with the flower part of the plant being replaced with a football. As the club moved to Livingston, the badge was changed again. The design of the thistle and the football is altered slightly; with the one major change being the addition of a Latin club motto \"Fortitier omnia vincit\" with the English translation meaning \"Bravely conquers all\". The current badge is modernised from the original Livingston badge but most of the features remain. The present badge also reintroduced the lion rampant in the centre of the laurel.\n\n\n== Sponsorship ==\nIn the Meadowbank Thistle era between 1973 and 1995, the club sourced various shirt sponsorship deals largely from small business such as Ferranti, Sports Conscious, Park & Milton, Raj Restaurant, ACA and PAR Scaffolding. Mitsubishi became the first major shirt sponsor of the club for the first three seasons of the Livingston era. Motorola then sponsored the club for the next four years. However, Motorola withdrew their shirt sponsorship at the end of the 2001\u201302 season, after the company\u2019s decline in the area. In 2002, Intelligent Finance, one of the largest employers in the West Lothian area, agreed an initial two-year sponsorship deal with the club worth an undisclosed six-figure sum. The company extended their shirt sponsorship for three more years, making their total sponsorship span over a five-year period.Smarter Loans became the club's main sponsor during the 2007\u201308 season, before the IT solutions company, RDF, signed a two-year deal to become main sponsors for seasons 2008\u201309 and 2009\u201310. However they withdrew their sponsorship after only one year, as a result of the ongoing financial crisis at the club that summer. Local supply chain solutions company Fasteq became the new main sponsor for season 2009\u201310 after the arrival of the new club owners. After four successful years as sponsors, Fasteq withdrew their sponsorship and Livingston announced that they were looking for new shirt sponsors for season 2013\u201314. Local business  Energy Assets were confirmed as new main sponsors on a three-year deal in June 2013.\n\n\n== Stadiums ==\n\nThe club have had three main grounds in their history; as Ferranti Thistle, the club initially played in local parks before finding a home at City Park in Edinburgh in 1969, then moving to Meadowbank Stadium in 1974 which was built for the 1970 Commonwealth Games.Livingston currently play their home games at the Almondvale Stadium in Livingston. It is currently known as the Tony Macaroni Arena due to a sponsorship deal. The 9,512 capacity stadium was constructed in 1995 as a joint venture between Meadowbank Thistle and the Livingston Development Corporation (LDC). Part of the deal involved the relocation of Meadowbank Thistle to the town and a name change to Livingston. When the LDC was wound up, ownership of the Stadium was transferred to West Lothian Council and the council have since rented the stadium to the club. The ground has hosted Scotland under-21, under-19, under-17s and Ladies matches, as well as one home game for Gretna due to problems with their ground share at Fir Park. In April 2011 it was revealed that it was possible Livingston would relocate to a new stadium around one mile from the current site due to West Lothian Council looking to sell the current site to a supermarket chain.\n\n\n== Players ==\n\n\n=== First-team squad ===\nAs of 31 January 2022Note: Flags indicate national team as defined under FIFA eligibility rules.

Livingston narrowly overcame their opponents after drawing 1\u20131 on aggregate, going through to the next round on the away goals rule. After drawing the home leg 0\u20130 Oscar Rubio scored the decisive away goal. In the following round they were drawn against Austrian side SK Sturm Graz.

It ranks fourth in the number of national titles won (13), behind G\u00f3rnik Zabrze, Ruch Chorz\u00f3w (both on 14), and Legia Warsaw (15), and second in all-time victories. Wis\u0142a was founded in 1906 under the name TS Wis\u0142a (Polish: Towarzystwo Sportowe Wis\u0142a).\nThe club's coat of arms is a white star on a red background crossed by a blue ribbon.\nWis\u0142a Krak\u00f3w has been one of the most successful Polish football clubs in recent years, winning eight league championships since 1999. Along with league titles, Wis\u0142a also won the Polish Cup on four occasions. Wis\u0142a also enjoyed some success in European competitions in the 1970s, reaching the quarter-finals in the 1978\u201379 European Cup and winning the UEFA Intertoto Cup in 1969, 1970 and 1973.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nWis\u0142a Krak\u00f3w was founded in 1906 when students of the Second Practical School in Krak\u00f3w, inspired by their professor Tadeusz \u0141opusza\u0144ski, formed a football club.In this first, historic season of the League, the fight for the championship was decided between two teams: Wis\u0142a Krak\u00f3w and 1. FC Kattowitz. This rivalry was treated very seriously, not only by the two sides involved, but also by the whole nation. 1. FC was regarded as the team supported by the German minority, while Wis\u0142a, at the end of this historic season, represented ambitions of all Poles.\n\nSome time in the fall of 1927 in Katowice, an ill-fated game between 1.FC and Wis\u0142a took place. Stakes were very high \u2013 the winner would become the Champion. Krak\u00f3w's side won 2\u20130 and became the Champion. 1.FC finished second, third was Warta Pozna\u0144.\nIn 1949, the club was renamed to Gwardia-Wis\u0142a Krak\u00f3w. In 1955 the club returned to its original name, TS Wis\u0142a. In 1967, the club was once again renamed, to GTS Wis\u0142a, a name which held until 1990 when the club reverted to its original name, TS Wis\u0142a. In the late 1990s, the football section of the club was incorporated and was renamed Wis\u0142a Krak\u00f3w SSA.\nThe club has had its ups and downs, winning national championships and earning European qualification. It was also relegated to the second division on three occasions. Since the football section has been bought by Tele-Fonika Kable S.A. in 1998, the team has been far and away the most successful club in Poland, winning seven national championships and finishing in second place three times, totalling ten top two finishes in 12 years.\nAt international level, Wis\u0142a has competed in all three of the European competitions. The club's greatest success came in the 1978\u201379 season, when Wis\u0142a was able to reach the quarter-finals of the European Cup, eventually to be knocked out by Malm\u00f6 FF 3\u20135 on aggregate. Most recently, Wis\u0142a narrowly missed out on a chance to compete in the 2005\u201306 UEFA Champions League group stage, being defeated 4\u20135 by Panathinaikos after extra time.Wis\u0142a also twice reached the second round of the European Cup Winners' Cup in 1967\u201368 and 1984\u201385, falling 0\u20135 and 2\u20133 by Hamburger SV and Fortuna Sittard respectively.\nThe White Star has competed in the UEFA Cup ten times.\n\n\n== Stadium ==\n\nWis\u0142a's Stadium is located at 22 Reymonta Street in Krak\u00f3w. The stadium was originally built in 1953 and currently has a capacity of 33,326.  The stadium was renovated in 2010, being upgraded to UEFA elite standards. The Wis\u0142a Stadium was also chosen as a reserve venue for the UEFA Euro 2012 tournament, jointly held in Poland and Ukraine. The record attendance of 45,000 at Wis\u0142a Stadium came on 29 September 1976 when Wis\u0142a defeated Celtic 2\u20130. The venue has been a fortress for Wis\u0142a, where the team is especially difficult to defeat. It is worth noting that Wis\u0142a holds the all-time Polish football record for consecutive league home games without a loss. The streak began following a loss on 16 September 2001 to KSZO Ostrowiec \u015awi\u0119tokrzyski, and ended more than five years later on 11 November 2006, when GKS Be\u0142chat\u00f3w defeated Wis\u0142a 4\u20132. The number of matches without a loss was then settled at 73, overcoming the former Polish record of 48 which belonged to Legia Warsaw. During the 2008\u201309 season, Wis\u0142a lost points at home only twice, drawing with \u0141KS \u0141\u00f3d\u017a and being defeated by Lech Pozna\u0144.\n\n\n== Supporters and rivalries ==\n\n\n=== Fan Friendlies ===\nWis\u0142a fans formerly had relations with Lechia Gda\u0144sk and \u015al\u0105sk Wroc\u0142aw until 2016, when their alliance fell apart. They formed a new group with Ruch Chorz\u00f3w and Widzew \u0141\u00f3d\u017a which divided Wis\u0142a fans. The club also has relations with Italian side Lazio, Serbian Red Star, and formerly held relations with Unia Tarn\u00f3w.\n\n\n=== The Holy War ===\nThe term \"Holy War\" refers to the intense rivalry between the two Krak\u00f3w-based teams; Wis\u0142a and KS Cracovia. In 1906, the establishment of the two first Polish football clubs, Cracovia and Wis\u0142a, created a rivalry that now dates back more than 100 years. The term \"Holy War\" was first used to describe the rivalry of Krak\u00f3w's Jewish teams, Makkabi and Jutrzenka. A Jutrzenka defender, Ludwik Gintel, who later joined the Cracovia side referred to the derby match against Wis\u0142a as the \"Holy War\".

It ranks fourth in the number of national titles won (13), behind G\u00f3rnik Zabrze, Ruch Chorz\u00f3w (both on 14), and Legia Warsaw (15), and second in all-time victories. Wis\u0142a was founded in 1906 under the name TS Wis\u0142a (Polish: Towarzystwo Sportowe Wis\u0142a).\nThe club's coat of arms is a white star on a red background crossed by a blue ribbon.\nWis\u0142a Krak\u00f3w has been one of the most successful Polish football clubs in recent years, winning eight league championships since 1999. Along with league titles, Wis\u0142a also won the Polish Cup on four occasions. Wis\u0142a also enjoyed some success in European competitions in the 1970s, reaching the quarter-finals in the 1978\u201379 European Cup and winning the UEFA Intertoto Cup in 1969, 1970 and 1973.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nWis\u0142a Krak\u00f3w was founded in 1906 when students of the Second Practical School in Krak\u00f3w, inspired by their professor Tadeusz \u0141opusza\u0144ski, formed a football club.In this first, historic season of the League, the fight for the championship was decided between two teams: Wis\u0142a Krak\u00f3w and 1. FC Kattowitz. This rivalry was treated very seriously, not only by the two sides involved, but also by the whole nation. 1. FC was regarded as the team supported by the German minority, while Wis\u0142a, at the end of this historic season, represented ambitions of all Poles.\n\nSome time in the fall of 1927 in Katowice, an ill-fated game between 1.FC and Wis\u0142a took place. Stakes were very high \u2013 the winner would become the Champion. Krak\u00f3w's side won 2\u20130 and became the Champion. 1.FC finished second, third was Warta Pozna\u0144.\nIn 1949, the club was renamed to Gwardia-Wis\u0142a Krak\u00f3w. In 1955 the club returned to its original name, TS Wis\u0142a. In 1967, the club was once again renamed, to GTS Wis\u0142a, a name which held until 1990 when the club reverted to its original name, TS Wis\u0142a. In the late 1990s, the football section of the club was incorporated and was renamed Wis\u0142a Krak\u00f3w SSA.\nThe club has had its ups and downs, winning national championships and earning European qualification. It was also relegated to the second division on three occasions. Since the football section has been bought by Tele-Fonika Kable S.A. in 1998, the team has been far and away the most successful club in Poland, winning seven national championships and finishing in second place three times, totalling ten top two finishes in 12 years.\nAt international level, Wis\u0142a has competed in all three of the European competitions. The club's greatest success came in the 1978\u201379 season, when Wis\u0142a was able to reach the quarter-finals of the European Cup, eventually to be knocked out by Malm\u00f6 FF 3\u20135 on aggregate. Most recently, Wis\u0142a narrowly missed out on a chance to compete in the 2005\u201306 UEFA Champions League group stage, being defeated 4\u20135 by Panathinaikos after extra time.Wis\u0142a also twice reached the second round of the European Cup Winners' Cup in 1967\u201368 and 1984\u201385, falling 0\u20135 and 2\u20133 by Hamburger SV and Fortuna Sittard respectively.\nThe White Star has competed in the UEFA Cup ten times.\n\n\n== Stadium ==\n\nWis\u0142a's Stadium is located at 22 Reymonta Street in Krak\u00f3w. The stadium was originally built in 1953 and currently has a capacity of 33,326.  The stadium was renovated in 2010, being upgraded to UEFA elite standards. The Wis\u0142a Stadium was also chosen as a reserve venue for the UEFA Euro 2012 tournament, jointly held in Poland and Ukraine. The record attendance of 45,000 at Wis\u0142a Stadium came on 29 September 1976 when Wis\u0142a defeated Celtic 2\u20130. The venue has been a fortress for Wis\u0142a, where the team is especially difficult to defeat. It is worth noting that Wis\u0142a holds the all-time Polish football record for consecutive league home games without a loss. The streak began following a loss on 16 September 2001 to KSZO Ostrowiec \u015awi\u0119tokrzyski, and ended more than five years later on 11 November 2006, when GKS Be\u0142chat\u00f3w defeated Wis\u0142a 4\u20132. The number of matches without a loss was then settled at 73, overcoming the former Polish record of 48 which belonged to Legia Warsaw. During the 2008\u201309 season, Wis\u0142a lost points at home only twice, drawing with \u0141KS \u0141\u00f3d\u017a and being defeated by Lech Pozna\u0144.\n\n\n== Supporters and rivalries ==\n\n\n=== Fan Friendlies ===\nWis\u0142a fans formerly had relations with Lechia Gda\u0144sk and \u015al\u0105sk Wroc\u0142aw until 2016, when their alliance fell apart. They formed a new group with Ruch Chorz\u00f3w and Widzew \u0141\u00f3d\u017a which divided Wis\u0142a fans. The club also has relations with Italian side Lazio, Serbian Red Star, and formerly held relations with Unia Tarn\u00f3w.\n\n\n=== The Holy War ===\nThe term \"Holy War\" refers to the intense rivalry between the two Krak\u00f3w-based teams; Wis\u0142a and KS Cracovia. In 1906, the establishment of the two first Polish football clubs, Cracovia and Wis\u0142a, created a rivalry that now dates back more than 100 years. The term \"Holy War\" was first used to describe the rivalry of Krak\u00f3w's Jewish teams, Makkabi and Jutrzenka. A Jutrzenka defender, Ludwik Gintel, who later joined the Cracovia side referred to the derby match against Wis\u0142a as the \"Holy War\". The phrase was incorporated into a song and has since been popular amongst both Wis\u0142a and Cracovia fans.\nThe first recorded Krak\u00f3w Derby was contested on 20 September 1908, a 1\u20131 draw. A historic derby match between Cracovia and Wis\u0142a occurred on 8 May 1913. It was the first time Polish teams played a championship game officially sanctioned by FIFA; Cracovia won 2\u20131. The most famous derby took place in 1948 when after the first post-war season, both Cracovia and Wis\u0142a accumulated an even number of points and the championship had to be decided by an additional game played at a neutral venue. On 5 December 1948, Cracovia defeated Wis\u0142a 3\u20131 and was crowned national champions. As of May 2011, the Krak\u00f3w derby game between Wis\u0142a and Cracovia has been contested 183 times, with Wis\u0142a winning 82 times, tying 42 times and Cracovia winning 59 times.\n\n\n=== Poland's Derby ===\nThe match contested between Wis\u0142a Krak\u00f3w and Legia Warsaw is commonly recognized as the greatest rivalry in Polish club football. Historically the two sides have been the most successful clubs in Poland, both in the top 2 in the all-time table. The rivalry between two of Poland's premier cities of Krak\u00f3w and Warsaw sparks the rivalry even more.

In 2008, he moved into management and has since been in charge of Ilkeston Town, Mansfield Town, Lincoln City and Goole.\n\n\n== Playing career ==\n\n\n=== Watford ===\nHoldsworth started his career at Watford in the mid-1980s, going on to make more than 250 league appearances for the club. At Watford he played alongside his brother Dean Holdsworth.\n\n\n=== Sheffield United ===\nIn October 1996, he left Watford for a new challenge at Sheffield United. In his first season, he helped United to the 1997 Football League First Division play-off Final but they were defeated by Crystal Palace. He also helped them to the 1997\u201398 FA Cup semi final at Old Trafford where they were defeated by Newcastle United. In the quarter final replay against Coventry City, United found themselves 1-0 down at Bramall Lane with 2 minutes left. Holdsworth popped up to equalise from a corner, sending the game to extra time and then penalties, which United went on to win.\n\n\n=== Birmingham City ===\nIn March 1999 Holdsworth transferred to Birmingham City. He helped Birmingham to the play offs at the end of that season where they faced his former club Watford. However Holdsworth was sent off as they lost on penalties. He spent three full seasons there, helping them to the 2001 League Cup Final in which he was an unused substitute in the defeat to Liverpool.\nIn January 2002 he went on loan to Walsall. At Walsall he scored once against Coventry but was sent off twice in 3-0 defeats to Sheffield Wednesday and Wolves.\n\n\n=== Later career ===\nAfter being released by Birmingham in 2002, he joined Bolton Wanderers on a free transfer where he played alongside his brother Dean again. However, he only made one appearance for the Trotters: in a League Cup defeat to Bury (David started and his brother Dean came on as a substitute).

It has, in addition to the main campus in Campo Grande (the State's capital), nine campuses located in the following inland cities: Aquidauana, Chapad\u00e3o do Sul, Corumb\u00e1, Coxim, Navira\u00ed, Nova Andradina, Parana\u00edba, Ponta Por\u00e3 e Tr\u00eas Lagoas.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Federal University of Mato Grosso do Sul's history begins in 1962, with the establishment of the University of Pharmacy and Odontology, being located in Campo Grande, which then belonged to the state of Mato Grosso.\nFurthermore, during the 1960s, the Brazilian dictatorship had plans to fund federal universities in each state capital. However, the southern population of Mato Grosso would not have access to them, which helped to increase the strength of the separatist movement and made the former state governor, Pedro Pedrossian, start to plan the creation of the State University of Mato Grosso, in Campo Grande.\nMeanwhile, in 1966, the University of Pharmacy and Odontology became Campo Grande's Biological Sciences Institute, which added a Medicine course to its curriculum. In 1967, the state of Mato Grosso's administration established the Human Sciences and Modern Languages Institute in Tr\u00eas Lagoas and the Superior Institute of Pedagogy, in Corumb\u00e1.In 1969, the State University of Mato Grosso was finally created. This new institution incorporated all of the above, and extended its reach, in 1970, to the towns of Aquidauana and Dourados, with the creation of two Centers of Pedagogy. The State University of Mato Grosso's creation was officialized on the 4th of November, 1970.\nIn 1977, the state of Mato Grosso was divided in two by the former president Ernesto Geisel. Therefore, the State University of Mato Grosso was now mainly located in cities that belonged to Mato Grosso do Sul.

Globis University started as a private education venture, Globis Management School, in 1992 by Japanese entrepreneur Yoshito Hori, later gaining official university status in 2006. Globis University is Japan's largest graduate business school, with an annual intake of 1,050 MBA students and enrollment of 2,624 students in 2021. \nThe university offers part-time and online MBA degree programs in English or Japanese and a full-time degree MBA program in English.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== GLOBIS Management School ===\nGlobis Management School was established as a private, non-accredited business school in Tokyo by Globis Corporation and its founder Yoshito Hori in 1992. It would form the basis for the later establishment of Graduate School of Management, Globis University. Hori, while doing his MBA at Harvard Business School from 1989 until 1991, observed that entrepreneurs in the US had access to a business environment highly conducive to start-ups. Aiming to nurture a similar environment in Japan, he set out to create a business centered around an ecosystem of knowledge, people and capital.Hori had initially approached his alma mater regarding opening a franchise in Japan but was turned down, leading to the establishment of an independent business school. A licensing agreement was made, however, allowing Harvard case studies to be used at GLOBIS Management School. The school started with 800,000 yen (about $7,000 USD) in capital and a single marketing course taught at a small rented classroom in Shibuya. Additional business subjects such as finance were soon introduced, all structured around the case study method, which was quite novel in Japan at the time.In 1993 a campus in Osaka was opened. By 1996 the curriculum had been expanded to allow the establishment of a joint MBA program with the University of Leicester. The first part of the program consisted of classes taught by Globis Management School in Japanese at locations in Tokyo and Osaka or by correspondence. The second part of the program was provided in English by Leicester Business School by correspondence. The joint MBA program would continue until January 2008.In 2003 the Graduate Diploma in Business Administration (GDBA) was launched, a non-degree program and predecessor to the MBA degree offered after university status was attained. GDBA was discontinued in 2013 with a total of 220 students having graduated.\n\n\n=== University Status ===\n\nGlobis Management School was accredited in December 2005 as a for-profit university established by a private company (\u682a\u5f0f\u4f1a\u793e\u7acb\u5927\u5b66, kabushiki gaisha ritsu daigaku). Provisions for the establishment of this type of university had been introduced as part of the Special Zones for Structural Reform Program (\u69cb\u9020\u6539\u9769\u7279\u5225\u533a\u57df\u5236\u5ea6, k\u014dz\u014d kaikaku tokubetsu kuiki seido) previously in 2003. This led to the establishment of the Graduate School of Management, Globis University in April 2006. That same year, university campuses in Tokyo and Osaka were formally established.However, in 2008 the decision was made to change the incorporation entity of Graduate School of Management, Globis University to a non-profit incorporated educational institution (\u5b66\u6821\u6cd5\u4eba, gakk\u014d h\u014djin) private university (\u79c1\u7acb\u5927\u5b66, shiritsu daigaku). This entity type had traditionally been reserved for organizations with substantial funds and ownership of land for campus development, but became an option for universities established by private companies after MEXT introduced changes to requirements. Changing to an incorporated educational institution allowed Globis University to establish a fund supported by internal reserves and donations, enabling a more stable and long-term development of the educational environment and campus facilities.\n\n\n=== Expansion ===\nFurther university campus locations were added in Nagoya in 2009, Sendai in 2012, Fukuoka in 2013, and Yokohama and Mito, Ibaraki in 2017. Outside of Japan campus locations were opened in Singapore in 2019 and Bangkok in 2020.\n\n\n== Campuses ==\n\nGlobis University has five campuses in Tokyo, Osaka, Nagoya, Sendai, and Fukuoka and two satellite campuses (\u7279\u8a2d\u30ad\u30e3\u30f3\u30d1\u30b9, tokusetsu kyanpasu) in Yokohama and Mito, Ibaraki in Japan. The main campus is located near K\u014djimachi Station in Banch\u014d, Chiyoda in central Tokyo, which offers both Japanese and English-language MBA programs. The Osaka, Nagoya, Sendai, and Fukuoka campuses offer Japanese-language MBA programs. Satellite campuses in Yokohama and Mito, Ibaraki only offer non-degree Pre-MBA courses in Japanese.\nOutside of Japan Globis University offers non-degree English-language Pre-MBA courses at campus locations in Singapore and Bangkok.\n\n\n== Academics ==\n\n\n=== Academic Programs ===\nGlobis University consists of a single graduate school of management. The university offers a one-year Full-time MBA degree program in English, which includes a 3-month professional internship, and two-year Part-time MBA and Online MBA degree programs in either Japanese or English. Preparatory non-degree Pre-MBA courses are also available in both Japanese and English, allowing credits to be transferred upon enrollment in the MBA degree programs.\n\n\n=== Accreditation ===\nGlobis University is fully accredited by the Japan University Accreditation Association (JUAA), Japan\u2019s higher education accreditation board, under both university and business school categories.\n\n\n=== Exchange Partners ===\nGlobis University has exchange programs with:\nCEIBS (China Europe International Business School)\nChulalongkorn Business School\n\n\n== Student Body ==\n\n\n=== Enrollment ===\nIn May 2021, the university had an enrollment of 2,624 graduate students.

Contract Express is available as a stand-alone app in a private or public cloud. Users of the product are typically law firms and corporations, such as Clifford Chance and Microsoft.\n\n\n== Functionality ==\nContract Express template creation is conducted entirely within a Microsoft Word interface. As a Microsoft Word App, Contract Express Author integrates into the Microsoft Word ribbon, providing a familiar user experience for users. The add-in provides the ease and speed of automating complex legal documents without the complexity inherent in traditional document assembly tools. Further, generated documents automatically inherit their styling from the marked-up Word document without having to apply styles to each generated document.  Authors create a contract template using bracket-based markups to specify conditional text and variable fields for us in their customized templates.\nOnce published, other users can then manipulate the document using a pre-defined questionnaire to apply client specific details and preferences. Accordingly, the need for programming skills is removed; a basic knowledge of document mark-up is all that is required. It is notable that the field control used is derived from the conventions of traditional legal document mark-up, for example use of square brackets to indicate areas for document specific information.The most recent version of the software is version 8.0, released in 2019. Contract Express includes provides users with an intuitive user interface, integrations with key legal software such as DocuSign for safe electronic signature iManage and NetDocuments for storage, and HighQ for client collaboration.\n\n\n== See also ==\nIntelligent document\nDocument modelling\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nLauristen, Mark.

It was first launched to allow offline access to Wikipedia, but has since expanded to include other projects from the Wikimedia Foundation, as well as public domain texts from Project Gutenberg. Available in more than 100 languages, Kiwix has been included in several high-profile projects, from smuggling operations in North Korea and encyclopedic access in Cuba to Google Impact Challenge's recipient Biblioth\u00e8ques Sans Fronti\u00e8res.\n\n\n== History ==\nFounder Emmanuel Engelhart sees Wikipedia as a common good, saying \"The contents of Wikipedia should be available for everyone! Even without Internet access. This is why I have launched the Kiwix project.\"After becoming a Wikipedia editor in 2004, Engelhart became interested in developing offline versions of Wikipedia. A project to make a Wikipedia CD, initiated in 2003, was a trigger for the project.In 2012, Kiwix received a grant from Wikimedia France to build a kiwix-plug, which was deployed to universities in eleven countries known as the Afripedia Project. In February 2013 Kiwix won SourceForge's Project of the Month award and an Open Source Award in 2015.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe software is designed as an offline reader for a web content. It can be used on computers without an internet connection, computers with a slow or expensive connection, or to avoid censorship. It can also be used while travelling (e.g. on a plane or train).\nUsers first download Kiwix, then download content for offline viewing with Kiwix. Compression saves disk space and bandwidth. All of English-language Wikipedia, with pictures, fits on a large USB stick or external media (87 GB as of December 2021, or 47 GB with no pictures).All content files are compressed in ZIM format, which makes them smaller, but leaves them easy to index, search, and selectively decompress.\nThe ZIM files are then opened with Kiwix, which looks and behaves like a web browser. Kiwix offers full text search, tabbed navigation, and the option to export articles to PDF and HTML.There is an HTTP server version called kiwix-serve; this allows a computer to host Kiwix content, and make it available to other computers on a network. The other computers see an ordinary website. Kiwix-hotspot is an HTTP server version for plug computers, which is often used to provide a Wi-Fi server.\n\n\n== Available content ==\n\nA list of content available on Kiwix is available for download, including language-specific sublists. Content can be loaded through Kiwix itself.\nSince 2014, most Wikipedia versions are available for download in various different languages. For English Wikipedia, a full version containing pictures as well as an alternative version containing text only can be downloaded from the archive. The servers are updated every two to ten months, depending on the size of the file. For English Wikipedia, the update frequency is thus substantially lower than the bzip2 database downloads by the Wikimedia Foundation, which are updated twice a month.Besides Wikipedia, content from the Wikimedia foundation such as Wikisource, Wikiquote, Wikivoyage, Wikibooks, and Wikiversity are also available for offline viewing in various different languages.In November 2014, a ZIM version of all open texts forming part of Project Gutenberg was made available.Besides public domain content, works licensed under a Creative Commons license are available for download as well. For example, offline versions of the Ubuntu wiki containing user documentation for the Ubuntu operating system, ZIM editions of TED conference talks and videos from Crash Course are available in the Kiwix archive as ZIM file formats.\n\n\n== Deployments ==\nKiwix can be installed on a desktop computer as a stand-alone program, installed on a tablet or smartphone, or can create its own WLAN environment from a Raspberry Pi.\nAs a software development project, Kiwix itself is not directly involved in deployment projects. However, third party organizations do use the software as a component of their own projects. Examples include:\n\nUniversities and libraries that can't afford broadband Internet access.The Afripedia Project set up kiwix servers in French-speaking universities, some of them with no Internet access, in 11 African countries.\nSchools in developing countries, where access to the internet is difficult or too expensive.Installed on computers used for the One Laptop per Child project.\nInstalled on Raspberry Pis for use in schools with no easy access to electricity in Tanzania by the Tanzania Development Trust.\nInstalled on tablets in schools in Mali as part of the MALebooks project.\nUsed by school teachers and university professors, as well as students, in Senegal.\nDeployed in Benin during teacher training seminars run by Zedaga, a Swiss NGO specialized in education.\nThe Fondation Orange has used kiwix-serve in its own French language technological knowledge product they have deployed in Africa.\nA special version for the organization SOS Children's Villages was developed, initially for developing countries, but it is also used in the developed world.\nAt sea and in other remote areas:Aboard ships in Antarctic waters.\nBy the Senegalese Navy in their patrol ships.\nIncluded in Navigatrix, a Linux distribution for people on boats.\nOn a train or plane.\nIn European and US prison education programs.\n\n\n=== Package managers and app stores ===\n\nKiwix was formerly available in the native package managers of some Linux distributions. However, Kiwix is currently not available in most package databases, due to XULRunner, a program on which Kiwix depends, being deprecated by Mozilla and removed from the package databases. Kiwix is available in the Sugar and ArchLinux Linux distributions. It is also available on Android.\nKiwix is available in the Microsoft Store, on Google Play, and Apple's iOS App Store. It is also available as an installable HTML5 app (Kiwix JS) in the form of browser extensions for Firefox and Chromium (Chrome, Edge) and as a Progressive Web Application (PWA), all of which work offline. Since 2015, a series of \"customized apps\" have also been released, of which Medical Wikipedia and PhET simulations are the two largest.\n\n\n== See also ==\nGoldenDict supports the ZIM file format since 2013, including offline use (except on Android) and the ability to create full-text indices.\nXOWA\nInternet-in-a-Box\nWikipedia:Database download\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links

Highway in the Los Angeles metropolitan area of the US state of California. The entire route connects San Pedro and the Port of Los Angeles with Downtown Los Angeles and Pasadena. The southern segment from San Pedro to I-10 in downtown Los Angeles is signed as I-110, while the northern segment to Pasadena is signed as SR 110. The entire length of I-110, as well as SR 110 south of the Four Level Interchange with US Route 101 (US 101), is the Harbor Freeway, and SR 110 north from US 101 to Pasadena is the historic Arroyo Seco Parkway, the first freeway in the western United States.\n\n\n== Route description ==\n\nRoute 110 is part of the California Freeway and Expressway System, and is part of the National Highway System, a network of highways that are considered essential to the country's economy, defense, and mobility by the Federal Highway Administration.\n\n\n=== Harbor Freeway ===\nThe Harbor Freeway, signed as I-110, begins at Gaffey Street in San Pedro, where it then travels mostly due north to the Santa Monica Freeway (I-10) at a point south of downtown Los Angeles, where it becomes signed as SR 110. I-110 is primarily within the city limits of Los Angeles, running right along the South Los Angeles region and the Harbor Gateway, a two-mile (3.2 km) wide north\u2013south corridor that was annexed by the city of Los Angeles specifically to connect San Pedro, Wilmington, and the Port of Los Angeles with the rest the city.\nNorth of I-10, the freeway continues as SR 110 through Downtown Los Angeles to its junction with US 101 at the Four Level Interchange.\nThe Harbor Freeway, along with the Long Beach Freeway (I-710), are the principal means for freight from the Port of Los Angeles to railyards and warehouses further inland. Its interchange with the Santa Monica Freeway is notoriously busy and congested, and the portions bordering Bunker Hill in northwest Downtown Los Angeles are choked with traffic at peak travel times.\n\n\n==== Harbor Transitway ====\nIn addition, the Harbor Transitway, a grade-separated bus and high-occupancy toll (HOT) corridor in the median of I-110, runs between SR 91 (Gardena Freeway) and the south side of Downtown Los Angeles. It carries the Metro J Line and other bus lines including Metro Express, Torrance Transit, Gardena Transit, LADOT, and OCTA.\n\n\n==== Landmarks ====\nNotable landmarks and attractions near the Harbor Freeway include the California State University, Dominguez Hills; Watts Towers; Exposition Park (including the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, the Banc of California Stadium and soon the Lucas Museum of Narrative Art); the University of Southern California; Staples Center; L.A. Live, Los Angeles Harbor College; the skyline of Downtown Los Angeles; and the Los Angeles Convention Center.\nThe Harbor Freeway is noted for its elaborate high-occupancy toll lane feature, with the HOT lanes elevated above the rest of traffic in many areas, constructed in 1994 by C.C. Myers, Inc. as HOV lanes and converted to HOT lanes in 2012. Of particular note is the Judge Harry Pregerson Interchange, which contains the most elaborate network of direct HOV/HOT connectors in Los Angeles County. It includes a 7-story ramp that connects the Century Freeway's HOV lanes to the Harbor Freeway's northbound HOT lanes and offers splendid views of the entire Los Angeles Basin and the San Gabriel Mountains. The interchange with SR 91 (formally known as the Edmund J. Russ Interchange) is also fairly large.\n\n\n=== Arroyo Seco Parkway ===\n\nSR 110 continues north as the Arroyo Seco Parkway from US 101 to Pasadena. From downtown, it passes through Elysian Park, where the northbound lanes pass through the four Figueroa Street Tunnels and the higher southbound lanes pass through a cut and over low areas on bridges. Then after crossing the Los Angeles River and the Golden State Freeway (I-5), the parkway runs alongside the Arroyo Seco seasonal river towards Pasadena.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nIn the 1924 Major Street Traffic Plan for Los Angeles, a widening of Figueroa Street to San Pedro as a good road to the Port of Los Angeles was proposed. Progress was slow, and, in 1933, the state legislature added the entire length to the state highway system as Route 165, an unsigned designation. This route not only extended from San Pedro north to Los Angeles, but continued through the city-built Figueroa Street Tunnels and along the northern extension of Figueroa Street to Eagle Rock, and then followed Linda Vista Avenue (via an overlap on Route 161 (SR 134) over the Colorado Street Bridge) to Route 9 (now I-210) at the Devil's Gate Reservoir. The entire length of Route 165 became Sign Route 11 in 1934. US Route 6 was also assigned to the portion between SR 1 and Avenue 26 in 1937, and, at about the same time, US 66 was moved from Eagle Rock Boulevard to Figueroa Street, overlapping SR 11 between Sunset Boulevard (US 101) and Colorado Street (SR 134).The state completed the Arroyo Seco Parkway which had been added to the state highway system in 1935 as Route 205, in early 1941, providing a faster route between SR 11 at Avenue 26 and Pasadena. US 66 was moved to the new route, while SR 11 remained on Figueroa Street and Linda Vista Avenue, the former also becoming a new US Route 66 Alternate. Construction of a freeway to San Pedro was much slower, despite having been in the earliest plans for an integrated system. Initially, the Harbor Parkway was to split at the merge with the Venice Parkway northeast of the University of Southern California, with the East By-Pass and West By-Pass straddling the Los Angeles Central Business District and rejoining at the split between the Arroyo Seco Parkway and Riverside Parkway south of Dodger Stadium. The West By-Pass was soon incorporated into the Harbor Parkway, and the first short piece, by then renamed the Harbor Freeway, opened on July 30, 1952, from the Four Level Interchange south to 3rd Street. (The Arroyo Seco Parkway was completed to the Four Level Interchange on September 22, 1953, and renamed the Pasadena Freeway on November 16, 1954.)\nThe Harbor Freeway gradually pushed south, opening to Olympic Boulevard on March 23, 1954, and Washington Boulevard on May 14, 1954. On March 27, 1956, the highway was extended to 42nd Street, and on April 24, 1957, it reached temporary ramps at 88th Place. Further extensions were made to Century Boulevard on July 31, 1958, 124th Street on September 24, 1958, Alondra Boulevard (which the county widened to carry the load) on May 2, 1960, 190th Street on July 15, 1960, Torrance Boulevard on August 28, 1962, and finally Pacific Coast Highway (SR 1) on September 26, 1962. There it connected with a section that had been open since June 19, 1956, from Pacific Coast Highway south to Channel Street. Along with the Vincent Thomas Bridge to Terminal Island, the final piece in San Pedro opened on July 9, 1970, completing the Harbor Freeway to its present length.In December 1978, the Harbor Freeway was approved as an Interstate Highway by the FHWA. In 1981, the SR 11 designation was renumbered as I-110 on the Harbor Freeway, and SR 110 on the Pasadena Freeway. The I-110 designation had been previously applied to what is now a spur of I-10 from 1958 to 1968.\n\n\n=== Richard Ankrom signage ===\nIn 2001, Richard Ankrom, a local artist who got lost trying to get onto I-5 North from northbound I-110 because there was no clear official signage labeling access to I-5 North, solved his frustration by covertly modifying one of the overhead signs on the freeway just before the Four Level Interchange (34.055759\u00b0N 118.256181\u00b0W\ufeff / 34.055759; -118.256181). Using official government sign specifications, Ankrom fabricated two sign pieces, one being an I-5 marker shield and the other with the word \"NORTH\", and affixed them to the left side of the sign. He performed his modifications in broad daylight, disguised as a Caltrans worker. In that district, Caltrans has three sign crews, each thinking one of the other two crews did the installation. After nine months, at Ankrom's request, the Los Angeles Downtown News broke the story.\nPrior to Ankrom's work, the only signage directing motorists to the I-5 North off-ramp came at a quarter-mile (0.40) before the exit, thus forcing many to merge across multiple lanes in a very short distance. The signs were inspected by Caltrans to ensure they would not fall off onto the road below. Ankrom was never charged, despite statements from officials that his actions were illegal. Ankrom referred to his sign project as \"Guerilla Public Service\".Caltrans later added an additional \"5 North\" sign over the left northbound lane at the entrance to the Figueroa Street Tunnels, as well as new electric signage, which will note when an additional lane is available for those wishing to transition to northbound I-5 (converting the current single lane transition to dual lanes).\nIn 2009, Caltrans replaced all signage along this segment with newer, more reflective versions. These new signs include Ankrom's original improvements.\n\n\n== Preservation ==\nDespite the increased traffic in Los Angeles, including trucks shipping products from the Port of Los Angeles in San Pedro, there are no plans to upgrade the rest of I-110 from I-10 to Pasadena to Interstate standards. Instead, Caltrans has pushed for a protected status alternative to preserve the Arroyo Seco Parkway as a historic landmark. The state legislature designated the original section, north of the Figueroa Street Viaduct, as a \"California Historic Parkway\" (part of the State Scenic Highway System reserved for freeways built before 1945) in 1993; the only other highway so designated is the Cabrillo Freeway (SR 163) in San Diego. The American Society of Civil Engineers named it a National Civil Engineering Landmark in 1999, and it became a National Scenic Byway in 2002.\n\n\n== Exit list ==\nThe entire route is in Los Angeles County.\n\n\n== See also ==\n California Roads portal\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nMetro ExpressLanes \u2013 includes toll information on the I-110 Express Lanes\nA written account of Richard Ankrom's sign modification\nAnkrom's Web page about the signs\nCalifornia Highways -

Painted in 1990, it has become one of the best known pieces of Berlin wall graffiti art. The painting depicts Leonid Brezhnev and Erich Honecker in a socialist fraternal kiss, reproducing a photograph taken in 1979 during the 30th anniversary celebration of the foundation of the German Democratic Republic.\n\n\n== The photograph ==\nThe well-known photograph capturing the famed embrace was taken by R\u00e9gis Bossu in East Berlin on October 7, 1979. It was widely republished. Brezhnev was visiting East Germany at the time to celebrate the anniversary of its founding as a Communist nation. On October 5, East Germany and the Soviet Union had signed a ten-year agreement of mutual support under which East Germany would provide ships, machinery and chemical equipment to the Soviet Union and the Soviet Union would provide fuel and nuclear equipment to East Germany.Currently, the rights for the photo are managed by Corbis Corporation.\n\n\n== The painting ==\nVrubel created the painting in 1990 on the eastern side of the Berlin Wall. Until the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, Berlin Wall graffiti art existed only on the western side. Vrubel attempted to obtain permission to paint on the eastern side, but the East German Ministry of National Defence disclaimed responsibility for the Wall. Instead, he found a \"Scottish girl\" selling \"permits\" to paint on the Wall, and he signed a contract that gave up all of his rights to the painting.Along with other murals in the section, the painting continued in display after the wall was taken down, but vandalism and atmospheric conditions gradually led to its deterioration. In March 2009, the painting, along with others, was erased from the wall to allow the original artists to repaint them with more durable paints. Vrubel was commissioned to repaint the piece, donating the \u20ac3000 fee he was paid to a social art project in Marzahn.In terms of style, there are slight differences between the 1990 and remade 2009 murals, and Vrubel has admitted he committed technical mistakes on the original piece due to inexperience with the method. However, the main message did not change despite the artist's doubts that Berliners would perceive it differently. The main difference between the first and second \"Kiss\" is the use of lines and color, which improved in the 2009 version giving it a more realistic appearance.\nPhotographer Bossu and Vrubel met in 2009 and were photographed together on 16 June with reproductions of their works.\n\n\n== Critical reception of the painting ==\nMy God, Help Me to Survive This Deadly Love has become one of the best known works of graffiti art on the Berlin Wall. According to Anthony Read and David Fisher, the painting is \"particularly striking, with a sharp, satirical edge.\" However, it was also widely criticized on creation as a straightforward reproduction of the photograph that inspired it.In a 2014 interview, the artist explains how both the location and the characters give meaning to the painting: \"In this painting, there's one German and one Russian, and the Berlin Wall is about the same thing but in reverse: here [in the painting], there's total love, while the Berlin Wall separates two worlds \u2014 it was a perfect fit.\" He wanted to create a \"wow\" factor. However, he did not expect the success it had.Prominent derivative works include Make Everything Great Again, a 2016 Lithuanian mural of Russian president Vladimir Putin and United States president Donald Trump in a similar pose, and a 2016 mural in Bristol featuring Donald Trump and pro-Brexit campaigner and British Member of Parliament Boris Johnson in the run-up to the 2016 referendum.\n\n\n== References ==", "infobox": {"image_file": "Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-F088809-0038, Berlin, East Side Gallery.jpg", "painting_alignment": "right", "image_size": "300px", "title": "My God, Help Me to Survive this Deadly Love", "alt": "Soviet premier [[Leonid Brezhnev]] locked in a mouth-to-mouth kiss with [[German Democratic Republic|East German]] leader [[Erich Honecker]] above the legend ''My God, Help Me to Survive This Deadly Love''", "type": "[[Graffiti]]", "artist": "[[Dmitri Vrubel]]", "year": "{{Start date|1990}}", "height_metric": "365", "width_metric": "480", "height_imperial": "143.7", "width_imperial": "189", "city": "[[Berlin]]", "museum": "[[East Side Gallery]]"}, "wikidata": {"Commons category (P373)": "Mein Gott, hilf mir, diese t\u00f6dliche Liebe zu \u00fcberleben", "image (P18)": "M\u00fchlenstrasse, Berlini Fal (East Side Gallery) a Hedwig-Wachenheim-Strasse-val szemben.

Illustrations were by Florence and Margaret Hoopes, with contributions from Christopher Sanders.\n\n\n== Publications ==\nThe first volumes of the 1949\u201350 Janet and John series were simply called Books One to Four and presented, using limited vocabulary, incidents from the daily life of a brother and sister.  Additional volumes soon followed: Through the Garden Gate (1950), Off to Play (1950), I Know a Story (1950), Here We Go (1951), and Once Upon a Time (1952). The books were described by the publishers as \"true to the best in life of modern children\".Beginning in 1949, Nisbet released a version specially published for New Zealand, with the same authors and illustrators. There were seven books in all: Out and About (1949), I Know a Story (1949), I Went Walking (1949), Here We Go (1949), Off to Play (1949), Through the Garden Gate (1951), and Once upon a Time (1951). The only distinctive New Zealand feature was a M\u0101ori legend included in the final title, Once Upon a Time. Eighty thousand copies of each book were distributed free to New Zealand schools from 1950. A further 20-30,000 of each were printed in 1956, and another 12-20,000 in 1959.\n\n\n== Heyday - 1950s and 1960s ==\nThe books became a familiar aid for teaching schoolchildren throughout the 1950s and 1960s, being used in 81% of British primary schools in 1968. They were one of the first popular \"look-and-say\" or \"whole word\" reading schemes, the approach being to repeat words sufficiently frequently that children memorised them \u2013 in contrast with the phonics method in which children were encouraged to decode groups of letters.\n\n\n== 1970s ==\nDuring the 1970s, new theories were developed on how children learn to read, and \"real books\" with \"real stories\" became increasingly popular. Janet and John's presentation of a middle-class nuclear family fell out of favour, and the series was discontinued in 1976.\n\n\n=== Kathy and Mark ===\n\nWorking with Philippa Murray, Rona Munro created an updated series for Nisbet and Co called Kathy and Mark. In the UK there were three Kathy and Mark Little Book collections, each of four volumes: Green 1-4 (1973), Orange 1-4 (1973), and Turquoise 1-4 (1974). They incorporated small in-line illustrations in place of certain words, such as 'umbrella'. Nisbet published a variety of Kathy and Mark books with other colours and titles.\n\n\n== 2000s ==\n\n\n=== Star Kids version ===\n\nHaving purchased the rights to Janet and John from Nisbet and Co, Star Kids Ltd published an updated series of 33 volumes in 2001 covering reading, writing and mathematics for children aged four to seven.  While the names Janet and John were retained, the text and illustrations were updated to include characters from different ethnic backgrounds and from non-nuclear families. The series attracted some criticism from those who disapproved of its disregard of phonics in favour of \"look and say\".\n\n\n=== Summersdale reprints ===\nIn 2007, as part of a trend in publishing nostalgic facsimiles of old favourites, Summersdale Publishers reissued two of the original Janet and John books, Here We Go and Off to Play.\n\n\n== Later critical responses ==\nAfter the books fell out of fashion they became a target for ridicule on the basis of their stilted diction and overwhelmingly middle-class content. The radio broadcaster Terry Wogan regularly satirised the books on his BBC Radio 2 show Wake Up To Wogan by reading out stories featuring an adult Janet and John in the style of the original, deriving humour through euphemism and innuendo.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nAnt & Bee\nDick and Jane\nPeter and Jane\nThe Magic Key\n\n\n== References ==", "infobox": {"name": "Janet and John series", "image": "Janet and John, Book 1, first edition cover 1949.png", "caption": "Book One first edition cover", "author": "[[Mabel O'Donnell]] and Rona Munro", "cover_artist": "Florence and Margaret Hoopes (illustrators)", "language": "English", "series": "''Janet and John'' series (Books One to Four)", "genre": "Children's reading books", "publisher": "James Nisbet and Company", "release_date": "1949\u201350", "media_type": "Print"}, "wikidata": {"instance of (P31)": "book series (Q277759)", "publication date (P577)": "+1949-00-00T00:00:00Z", "author (P50)": "Mabel O'Donnell (Q16011320)", "Freebase ID (P646)": "/m/0h12w4"}, "cat": "Written_communication", "url": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janet_and_John", "wikibase": "Q6153661"}, {"name": "Jet Set Radio", "url_name": "1058067", "txt": "Jet Set Radio (originally released in North America as Jet Grind Radio) is a 2000 action game developed by Smilebit and published by Sega for the Dreamcast. The player controls a member of a youth gang, the GGs, as they use inline skates to traverse Tokyo, spraying graffiti, challenging rival gangs, and evading authorities.\nDevelopment was headed by director Masayoshi Kikuchi, with art by Ryuta Ueda. The influence was drawn from late 1990s Japanese popular culture such as the rhythm game PaRappa the Rapper, and the anti-establishment themes in the film Fight Club. The environments were based on Tokyo shopping districts in Shibuya and Shinjuku, with graffiti designed by artists including Eric Haze. It was the first game to use a cel-shaded art style, developed in response to the team's disappointment towards Sega games mainly resembling anime or manga.\nJet Set Radio received acclaim and is considered one of the best video games ever made for its graphics, soundtrack, and gameplay. It won several awards and was nominated for many others. A Game Boy Advance version, developed by Vicarious Visions, was released in 2003, along with versions for Japanese mobile phones. In 2012, Jet Set Radio was digitally re-released for the Xbox 360, PlayStation 3 and iOS, followed by releases for Windows, PlayStation Vita and Android. A sequel, Jet Set Radio Future,  was released for the Xbox in 2002.\n\n\n== Gameplay ==\n\nThe player controls a member of a gang of graffiti-tagging inline skaters. The game consists of three types of levels: Street, Rival Showdown, and Trial. The Street levels come in two categories. The first is to tag every graffiti point in each area previously tagged by a rival gang before the timer runs out while evading the authorities. The second category serves as a boss battle by chasing the rival gang members and spraying graffiti on them. The more graffiti points are sprayed, the more deadly the authorities become. Graffiti points are marked by arrows and require paint to tag them. Players can spray graffiti by either pressing a single button or inputting commands using the analog stick depending on the size of the graffiti spot. Players are unable if they run out of paint and must be refilled by obtaining yellow and blue spray cans scattered across the stage. Yellow spray cans refill a single spray can and blue spray cans refill five. Enemies will pursue players and attempt to deplete their health. Health can be replenished by obtaining red and green spray cans. Performing tricks add bonus points to the player's overall score and gain access to areas difficult to reach.In Rival Showdown levels, more playable characters can be unlocked after they are defeated by matching the rival's movements in technique sections or by spraying graffiti before the rival in race sections. Trial levels are unlocked after Street and Rival Showdown levels are cleared in a specific area. There are three kinds of trials: Jet Graffiti, Jet Tech, and Jet Crash. In Jet Graffiti, the objective is to spray all the graffiti points within the time limit. Jet Tech prioritizes in obtaining the top score within the time limit. In Jet Crash, the objective is to reach the goal and spray graffiti on it before the opponent. Players can customize their graffiti by choosing presets, or create their own using the Graffiti editor. By using a VMU, players can upload their graffiti to the official website for other players to use or download graffiti from other players. More Graffiti presets can be unlocked by collecting Graffiti Soul icons scattered throughout stages.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nDJ Professor K broadcasts the Jet Set Radio pirate radio station to gangs of youths who roam Tokyo-to, skating and spraying graffiti. One gang, the GGs, competes for turf with the all-female Love Shockers in the shopping districts of Shibuya-Cho, the cyborg Noise Tanks in the Benten entertainment district, and the kaiju-loving Poison Jam in the Kogane dockyard. The authorities, led by Captain Onishima, pursue the gangs with riot police and military armaments. After the GGs defeat Poison Jam, Noise Tanks, and Love Shockers in turf wars, they each drop a piece of a mysterious vinyl record. Professor K says that the mysterious vinyl has the power to summon a demon.\nThe GGs are joined by Combo and Cube, who explain that their hometown, Grind City, has been overtaken by the Rokkaku business conglomerate. They ask the GGs to help them to free their friend, Coin, who has been captured by the Rokkaku. The Rokkaku pursue the GGs and steal the vinyl record. Poison Jam explains that the Rokkaku CEO, Goji Rokkaku, plans to use the record to make a contract with the demon and take over the world. The GGs defeat Goji in the rooftop of his headquarters by destroying his turntable. Freedom is returned to the streets of Tokyo-to. Combo reveals that The Devil's Contract was an old record with no demonic powers and that wealth had driven Goji to insanity.\n\n\n== Development ==\n\nJet Set Radio was developed by Smilebit, a Sega studio formed from members of Team Andromeda, developers of the Panzer Dragoon games for the Sega Saturn. The development team consisted of fewer than 25 developers, with an average age of under 25. Programming began in mid-1999. The game was announced at the 1999 Tokyo Game Show and drew media attention for its cel-shaded style. During the early stages of development, director Masayoshi Kikuchi had difficulty leading the team, having no prior directing experience. The visual style was established before the gameplay; according to Kikuchi, the game could have become an adventure game or role-playing game. His superiors were not satisfied with early concepts, and so Kikuchi used trial and error to develop a concept that he believed everyone would find interesting.Ueda wanted to create something \"cool\" that dealt with popular culture and was completely unlike the team's previous game, the 1998 role-playing game Panzer Dragoon Saga.  Ueda's drawings of a punky character with headphones and rollerblades became the foundation of the game. Ueda had joined Sega after being impressed by the \"freshness\" and international appeal of Sonic the Hedgehog, but was disappointed with the number of manga and anime-style designs; he hoped to create something original. Smilebit drew inspiration from games outside the typical game genres of science fiction and fantasy. Ueda was particularly inspired by a demonstration of the PlayStation rhythm game PaRappa the Rapper at the 1996 Tokyo Game Show: \"I think that's the first game with pop culture like that. They did it first. After that I decided to make a true game, not just a visual experience, that was actually for adults\". The anti-establishment themes of the 1999 film Fight Club were another influence.Smilebit used thicker lines for objects they wanted to stand out. Smilebit developed a new cel-shading technique not used at the time as it would not have been possible on the Dreamcast or PlayStation 2. The game features graffiti by a variety of artists, including Eric Haze, who had designed album art for acts including the Beastie Boys and Public Enemy. Smilebit initially wanted to make it a skateboarding game, but was scrapped due to the legs having to be fixed and instead chose inline skates.Jet Set Radio was one of the earliest games to feature an open 3D world, which presented the team's biggest challenge. Kikuchi said: \"Making an entire town in a game was quite the prospect. It's not hard with modern hi-spec hardware, but that wasn't the case back then... It was very difficult from a programming standpoint\". Another Sega game developed in that period, Shenmue (1999), also featured an open world, but Kikuchi felt the games posed different technical challenges, as Shenmue does not allow the player to jump or move at speed. The team implemented grinding to allow players to enjoy speed without worrying about colliding with obstacles. Smilebit chose to have a fixed camera as an attempt to reduce motion sickness. They attempted to make the game impossible to duplicate on PlayStation 2 by pushing the Dreamcast limitations using bright colors, realistic shadows, and more than sixteen NPCs on-screen without lag that would have been impossible on PS2 due to its smaller memory.The settings were inspired by Japanese locations such as the Tokyo shopping districts of Shibuya and Shinjuku, which Smilebit photographed to use as references. Sega feared that the game's style might alienate players outside Japan and requested changes for the international versions. The team added stages modeled after New York City: one based on Times Square, and another on Roosevelt Avenue along Queens and Brooklyn, and changed the nationality of two characters to American. The interactive credits sequence of the Japanese version was also cut, as localizing it would have meant rebuilding the stage with English names. Sega sold the international version in Japan as De La Jet Set Radio. Ueda was unhappy about the changes, which he felt diminished the essential Japanese elements of the game.\n\n\n=== Soundtrack ===\nThe Jet Set Radio soundtrack includes original and licensed tracks with a variety of genres including J-pop, hip hop, funk, electronic dance, rock, acid jazz, and trip hop. The main theme of the game is called \"Let Mom Sleep\". The North American version and international rereleases add metal songs. The 2012 port omits \"Yappie Feet\" and \"Many Styles\" for licensing reasons. The music has been described as energetic, rhythm-heavy, defiant, and multicultural. Most of the soundtrack was composed by Hideki Naganuma, with additional tracks by Richard Jacques, Deavid Soul, Toronto, and B.B. Rights.  Naganuma attempted to match the visual style, and experimented with voices, cutting and rearranging samples to the point that they became nonsensical. In 2012, Naganuma said Jet Set Radio and its sequel had been his favorite projects. Smilebit worked with Sega of America and Sega of Europe to include as many street culture elements as possible, hoping to create music that was internationally acceptable.Jet Set Radio Original Soundtrack was distributed by Polydor Records on December 20, 2000, in Japan. For the HD release, a new soundtrack was distributed by Sumthing Else on September 18, 2012, for North America and Europe and contained additional tracks from the sequel, Jet Set Radio Future. A second soundtrack for the HD version, Jet Set Radio: Sega Original Tracks, was distributed by Sega and released on iTunes on October 3, 2012.\n\n\n=== Promotion and release ===\n\nJet Set Radio was released in Japan on June 29, 2000. In North America, it was released on October 31 as Jet Grind Radio due to trademark problems for \"Jet Set\" in the United States at the time. The PAL version was released later on November 24 under the original name. The North American and PAL versions contained two new maps, new songs, and other in-game content designed to increase the game's appeal to Western audiences. To promote the North American release, Sega of America held a \"Graffiti is Art\" competition for contestants to enter their own graffiti art pieces to Sega. Sega chose five finalists and flew them into San Francisco, California on October 21, where they competed to make graffiti art pieces on a canvas within a 3 and a half-hour timeframe for a prize of $5000. Mayor of San Francisco, Willie Brown discovered the competition and attempted to revoke Sega of America's permit, but was unsuccessful due to obtaining the permit legally.Sega re-released the game in Japan under the name De La Jet Set Radio. This version was released on October 18, 2001, in Japan via Dreamcast Direct (later renamed Sega Direct) and included a T-shirt featuring the protagonist Beat for those who pre-ordered. This version features content that was originally exclusive to PAL and North American versions, namely music, two playable characters, and two stages.\n\n\n== Alternative versions ==\n\n\n=== Mobile versions ===\n\nJet Set Radio was remade as two 2D mobile versions. The first, Typing Jet, a side-scrolling game in which players escape police, was released for Japanese mobile phones by Sega on June 22, 2001. It was followed by a remake for Game Boy Advance developed by Vicarious Visions and published by THQ in North America on June 26, 2003, and in Europe on February 20, 2004. The Game Boy Advance version uses the Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2 engine and an isometric perspective, and emulates the cel-shaded graphics of the Dreamcast game, with some original stages and shortened songs.\n\n\n=== High-definition remaster ===\nIn 2012, high-definition ports developed by BlitWorks were released for PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Windows, PlayStation Vita, iOS and Android. The ports add features including widescreen HD graphics, online leaderboards, achievements, and a new camera system. It combines the North American, European and Japanese soundtracks and adds bonus tracks from Jet Set Radio Future, but omits the PAL tracks \"Yappie Feet\" and \"Many Styles\". To promote the ports, Sega ran a contest to allow players to submit their own artwork to be used as graffiti within the game. On May 3, 2016, the game was made backwards-compatible with the Xbox One.In North America, the PS3 version was released on September 18, with PlayStation Plus members able to purchase it early on September 11. The PS3 version was released in Europe the following day alongside The Xbox Live Arcade and Windows version for both North America and Europe. The PlayStation Vita version was scheduled for release on October 16, but was delayed for development optimization reasons; it was released on November 20 in North America and in Europe the following day. The PS3, Xbox 360, and PlayStation Vita versions were released in Japan simultaneously on February 20, 2013.The iOS and Android versions were released in North America and Europe on November 29, 2012. Japan received the iOS and Android versions on December 20, 2012, and January 30, 2013, respectively. The smartphone versions were delisted as of 2015 due to compatibility problems with the updated operating systems of the iOS.\n\n\n== Reception ==\n\n\n=== Critical reception ===\nJet Set Radio received acclaim for its gameplay, visual style, and music. Gamers' Republic called it flawless. IGN praised the extra gameplay modes, saying they added replay value. Official Dreamcast Magazine (ODCM) found the exaggerated physics and interactivity of the levels immersive. DC-UK described the gameplay as a combination of Crazy Taxi and Tony Hawk, and concluded that the gameplay was better than both. GameSpot praised the pacing, stating that the beginning of the game is simple and slowly becomes more challenging as the player progresses. GameFan was not impressed with the early stages but their opinion changed as they progressed the game and were happy with the result. Next Generation found the story modifications of the English versions jarring, although, he complimented the new stages, calling them \"impressive\" and \"a worthy addition to Japanese cityscapes of the original\". The camera controls were commonly criticized, but most reviewers felt the overall quality outweighed them.In regards to the visual style, IGN said it \"looks like a moving cartoon, and every character, right down to the police dogs, is practically overflowing with personality ... It has the type of look that makes non-gamers can't help but be impressed\". ODCM called it \"gorgeous\" and compared it to the move to color television. DC-UK also praised it for resembling 2D cartoon and 3D at the same, and considered it ground-breaking. GamePro wrote that the visuals were one of a kind and that the stylized design was convincing and fun to look at.When reviewing the music, GamePro called Jet Set Radio one of the best-sounding games of the year, and ODCM said it had \"one of the best soundtracks ever\". IGN also praised the soundtrack, but was critical of the tracks added to the North American release, in particular songs from Rob Zombie. Next Generation, however, didn't consider the new tracks to make a difference, stating the soundtrack was incredible from the start. GameSpot felt the soundtrack fit perfectly into the game's environment.When reviewing the HD remaster, the game received mixed reactions from critics. GamesRadar+  praised how it is a joy to play even after 12 years since its release. Eurogamer also gave positive statements,  calling the visual style \"timeless\", and complimented the HD remaster, stating \"12 years on and this is a surprisingly rigorous game built of oddball delights, then, and the HD updating has only enhanced its charms. The skating's still great, the city's still a joy to explore, and the soundtrack's still one of the very best ever put together\". Game Informer was more critical, opining that the gameplay was archaic and frustrating. Game Informer further elaborated that in retrospect, the original release visual style blinded them from its faulty gameplay. Both TouchArcade and Pocket Gamer criticized smartphone versions for the touchscreen controls and unable to keep up with the tasks the game requires.Across all versions of the game, including the original and re-releases sales of Jet Set Radio surpassed 1 million copies worldwide.\n\n\n=== Accolades ===\nJet Set Radio won the Best Console Game at the E3 Game Critics Awards in 2000 and was the runner up for Best in Show at the same event. The game won the category of \"Excellence in Visual Arts\" award, received a \"Game Spotlights Award\" and was nominated for Game of the year at the 2001 Game Developers Choice Awards. It was nominated for Game Design, Game of the Year, Console Game of the Year, Console Innovation, Original Music Composition, Sound Design, and Visual Engineering at the 4th Annual Interactive Achievement Awards in 2001. It won GameSpot's annual \"Best Graphics, Artistic\" award among console games, and was nominated in the \"Best Game Music\" and \"Best Platform Game\" categories. Gamers' Republic awarded it \"Best 3D Game Design\" in their 2000 Year in Review. The game was also featured in 1001 Video Games You Must Play Before You Die.\n\n\n== Legacy and sequel ==\nJet Set Radio is recognized as one of the first games to feature cel-shaded graphics, with exaggerated shapes, thick lines, and flat, bright colors. Insomniac owner Ted Price credited Jet Set Radio as an influence on their game Sunset Overdrive. Numerous indie developers have cited Jet Set Radio as a major influence on their games, the most notable being the successfully crowdfunded Hover: Revolt of Gamers, Lethal League, and the upcoming Bomb Rush Cyberfunk, all of which draw heavy inspiration from Jet Set Radio's visuals and music and feature contributions from Jet Set Radio composer Hideki Naganuma. The game has also been speedrun at Games Done Quick multiple times. Other notable fan community-based Jet Set Radio projects have been Jet Set Radio Live, a 24/7 browser-based radio station based on the fictional radio station in-game created in January 2016 and the album Memories of Tokyo-To by American musician 2 Mello released February 20, 2018.A sequel, Jet Set Radio Future, was released for the Xbox in 2002, early in the system's life cycle. Two main characters, Beat and Gum, appear as playable characters in the games Sega Superstars Tennis and Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed, and the former also made an appearance in Archie Comics' Sonic Universe issue 45, an adaptation of the game along with Sonic & Sega All-Stars Racing.In 2009, an early antagonist in the game, Captain Onishima, was ranked 95th in IGN's \"Top 100 Videogame Villains\" list. Jet Set Radio as well as Jet Set Radio Future are highly requested games to be ported to the Xbox One, the Xbox Series X/S and the Nintendo Switch. In 2021, Sega teased the possibility of a Jet Set Radio reboot, and announced Beat as a playable character for Super Monkey Ball: Banana Mania.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nRestoration of the original Official American website\nOfficial Japanese website", "infobox": {"title": "Jet Set Radio", "image": "Jet Set Radio cover art 2012.jpeg", "developer": "[[Smilebit]]<br/>[[BlitWorks]] (HD)", "publisher": "[[Sega]]", "director": "Masayoshi Kikuchi", "producer": "Kawagoe Takayuki", "artist": "Ryuta Ueda", "designer": "Hosokawa Kazuki", "composer": "[[Hideki Naganuma]]", "series": "'''''Jet Set Radio'''''", "released": "{{collapsible list|title|=|June 29, 2000|titlestyle|=|font-weight:normal;font-size:normal;background:transparent;text-align:left\n|'''Dreamcast'''|vgrelease|JP|June 29, 2000|NA|October 31, 2000|EU|November 24, 2000|\n'''Java ME'''|vgrelease|JP|June 22, 2001|\n'''PlayStation 3'''|vgrelease|NA|September 18, 2012|EU|September 19, 2012|JP|February 20, 2013|\n'''Windows'''|vgrelease|WW|September 19, 2012|\n'''Xbox 360'''|vgrelease|WW|September 19, 2012|JP|February 20, 2013|\n'''PlayStation Vita'''|vgrelease|NA|November 20, 2012|EU|November 21, 2012|JP|February 20, 2013|\n'''iOS'''|vgrelease|WW|November 29, 2012|JP|December 20, 2012|\n'''Android'''|vgrelease|WW|November 29, 2012|JP|January 30, 2013}} {{vgrelease|JP|June 29, 2000|NA|October 31, 2000|EU|November 24, 2000}} '''Java ME''' {{vgrelease|JP|June 22, 2001}} '''PlayStation 3''' {{vgrelease|NA|September 18, 2012|EU|September 19, 2012|JP|February 20, 2013}} '''Windows''' {{vgrelease|WW|September 19, 2012}} '''Xbox 360''' {{vgrelease|WW|September 19, 2012|JP|February 20, 2013}} '''PlayStation Vita''' {{vgrelease|NA|November 20, 2012|EU|November 21, 2012|JP|February 20, 2013}} '''iOS''' {{vgrelease|WW|November 29, 2012|JP|December 20, 2012}} '''Android''' {{vgrelease|WW|November 29, 2012|JP|January 30, 2013}}", "genre": "[[Platform game|Platform]], [[Action game|action]], [[Sports game|sports]]", "modes": "[[Single-player video game|Single-player]]", "platforms": "{{Hlist|[[Dreamcast]]|[[Java Platform, Micro Edition|Java ME]]|[[PlayStation 3]]|[[Windows]]|[[Xbox 360]]|[[PlayStation Vita]]|ref| name=\"Vita-announce\"|{{cite web|title=Jet Set Radio coming to Vita too -

Initially developed by IUPAC (International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry) and NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) from 2000 to 2005, the format and algorithms are non-proprietary.\nThe identifiers describe chemical substances in terms of layers of information \u2014 the atoms and their bond connectivity, tautomeric information, isotope information, stereochemistry, and electronic charge information.\nNot all layers have to be provided; for instance, the tautomer layer can be omitted if that type of information is not relevant to the particular application. The InChI algorithm converts input structural information into a unique InChI identifier in a three-step process: normalization (to remove redundant information), canonicalization (to generate a unique number label for each atom), and serialization (to give a string of characters).\nInChIs differ from the widely used CAS registry numbers in three respects: firstly, they are freely usable and non-proprietary; secondly, they can be computed from structural information and do not have to be assigned by some organization; and thirdly, most of the information in an InChI is human readable (with practice). InChIs can thus be seen as akin to a general and extremely formalized version of IUPAC names. They can express more information than the simpler SMILES notation and differ in that every structure has a unique InChI string, which is important in database applications. Information about the 3-dimensional coordinates of atoms is not represented in InChI; for this purpose a format such as PDB can be used.\nThe InChIKey, sometimes referred to as a hashed InChI, is a fixed length (27 character) condensed digital representation of the InChI that is not human-understandable.  The InChIKey specification was released in September 2007 in order to facilitate web searches for chemical compounds, since these were problematic with the full-length InChI. Unlike the InChI, the InChIKey is not unique: though collisions can be calculated to be very rare, they happen.In January 2009 the 1.02 version of the InChI software was released. This provided a means to generate so called standard InChI, which does not allow for user selectable options in dealing with the stereochemistry and tautomeric layers of the InChI string. The standard InChIKey is then the hashed version of the standard InChI string. The standard InChI will simplify comparison of InChI strings and keys generated by different groups, and subsequently accessed via diverse sources such as databases and web resources.\nThe continuing development of the standard has been supported since 2010 by the not-for-profit InChI Trust, of which IUPAC is a member. The current software version is 1.06 and was released in December 2020.  Prior to 1.04, the software was freely available under the open-source LGPL license,\nbut it now uses a custom license called IUPAC-InChI Trust License.\n\n\n== Generation ==\nIn order to avoid generating different InChIs for tautomeric structures, before generating the\nInChI, an input chemical structure is normalized to reduce it to its so-called core parent structure.\nThis may involve changing bond orders, rearranging formal charges and possibly adding\nand removing protons.  Different input structures may give the same result; for example,\nacetic acid and acetate would both give the same core parent structure, that of acetic\nacid.  A core parent structure may be disconnected, consisting of more than one component,\nin which case the\nsublayers in the InChI usually consist of sublayers for each component, separated by semicolons\n(periods for the chemical formula sublayer.)  One way this can happen is that all\nmetal atoms are disconnected during normalization; so, for example, the InChI for tetraethyllead\nwill have five components, one for lead and four for the ethyl groups.The first, main, layer of the InChI refers to this core parent structure, giving its\nchemical formula, non-hydrogen connectivity without bond order (/c sublayer) and\nhydrogen connectivity (/h sublayer.)  The /q portion of\nthe charge layer gives its charge, and the /p portion of the charge layer tells how many\nprotons (hydrogen ions) must be added to or removed from it to regenerate the original structure.\nIf present, the stereochemical layer, with sublayers /b, /t, /m and /s, gives stereochemical information, and\nthe isotopic layer\n/i (which may contain sublayers /h, /b, /t, /m and /s) gives isotopic information.\nThese are the only layers which can occur in a standard InChI.If the user wants to specify an exact tautomer, a fixed hydrogen layer /f can be appended, which may contain\nvarious additional sublayers; this cannot be done in standard InChI though, so different tautomers will have\nthe same standard InChI (for example, alanine will give the same standard InChI whether input in a neutral or a zwitterionic form.)\nFinally, a nonstandard reconnected /r layer can be added, which effectively gives a new InChI generated without\nbreaking bonds to metal atoms.  This may contain various sublayers, including /f.\n\n\n== Format and layers ==\nEvery InChI starts with the string \"InChI=\" followed by the version number, currently 1. If the InChI is standard, this is followed by the letter S for standard InChIs, which is a fully standardized InChI flavor maintaining the same level of attention to structure details and the same conventions for drawing perception. The remaining information is structured as a sequence of layers and sub-layers, with each layer providing one specific type of information. The layers and sub-layers are separated by the delimiter \"/\" and start with a characteristic prefix letter (except for the chemical formula sub-layer of the main layer). The six layers with important sublayers are:\n\nMain layer\nChemical formula (no prefix). This is the only sublayer that must occur in every InChI.  Numbers used throughout the InChI are given in the formula\u2019s element order excluding hydrogen atoms. For example, \u201c/C10H16N5O13P3\u201d implies that atoms numbered 1\u201310 are carbons, 11\u201315 are nitrogens, 16\u201328 are oxygens, and 29\u201331 are phosporus.\nAtom connections (prefix: \"c\"). The atoms in the chemical formula (except for hydrogens) are numbered in sequence; this sublayer describes which atoms are connected by bonds to which other ones.\nHydrogen atoms (prefix: \"h\"). Describes how many hydrogen atoms are connected to each of the other atoms.\nCharge layer\ncharge sublayer (prefix: \"q\")\nproton sublayer (prefix: \"p\" for \"protons\")\nStereochemical layer\ndouble bonds and cumulenes (prefix: \"b\")\ntetrahedral stereochemistry of atoms and allenes (prefixes: \"t\", \"m\")\ntype of stereochemistry information (prefix: \"s\")\nIsotopic layer (prefixes: \"i\", \"h\", as well as \"b\", \"t\", \"m\", \"s\" for isotopic stereochemistry)\nFixed-H layer (prefix: \"f\"); contains some or all of the above types of layers except atom connections; may end with \"o\" sublayer; never included in standard InChI\nReconnected layer (prefix: \"r\"); contains the whole InChI of a structure with reconnected metal atoms; never included in standard InChIThe delimiter-prefix format has the advantage that a user can easily use a wildcard search to find identifiers that match only in certain layers.\n\n\n== InChIKey ==\nThe condensed, 27 character InChIKey is a hashed version of the full InChI (using the SHA-256 algorithm), designed to allow for easy web searches of chemical compounds. The standard InChIKey is the hashed counterpart of standard InChI. Most chemical structures on the Web up to 2007 have been represented as GIF files, which are not searchable for chemical content.  The full InChI turned out to be too lengthy for easy searching, and therefore the InChIKey was developed.  There is a very small, but nonzero chance of two different molecules having the same InChIKey, but the probability for duplication of only the first 14 characters has been estimated as only one duplication in 75 databases each containing one billion unique structures.  With all databases currently having below 50 million structures, such duplication appears unlikely at present. A recent study more extensively studies the collision rate finding that the experimental collision rate is in agreement with the theoretical expectations.The InChIKey currently consists of three parts separated by hyphens, of 14, 10 and one character(s), respectively, like XXXXXXXXXXXXXX-YYYYYYYYFV-P. The first 14 characters result from a SHA-256 hash of the connectivity information (the main layer and /q sublayer of the charge layer) of the InChI. The second part consists of 8 characters resulting from a hash of the remaining layers of the InChI, a single character indicating the kind of InChIKey (S for standard and N for nonstandard), and a character indicating the version of InChI used (currently A for version 1.)\nFinally, the single character at the end indicates the protonation of the core parent structure, corresponding to the /p sublayer of the charge layer (N for no protonation, O, P, ... if protons should be added and M, L, ... if they should be removed.)\n\n\n=== Example ===\n \nMorphine has the structure shown on the right. The standard InChI for morphine is  \t InChI=1S/C17H19NO3/c1-18-7-6-17-10-3-5-13(20)16(17)21-15-12(19)4-2-9(14(15)17)8-11(10)18/h2-5,10-11,13,16,19-20H,6-8H2,1H3/t10-,11+,13-,16-,17-/m0/s1\nand the standard InChIKey for morphine is BQJCRHHNABKAKU-KBQPJGBKSA-N.\n\n\n=== InChI resolvers ===\nAs the InChI cannot be reconstructed from the InChIKey, an InChIKey always needs to be linked to the original InChI to get back to the original structure. InChI Resolvers act as a lookup service to make these links, and prototype services are available from National Cancer Institute, the UniChem service at the European Bioinformatics Institute, and PubChem. ChemSpider has had a resolver until July 2015 when it was decommissioned.\n\n\n== Name ==\nThe format was originally called IChI (IUPAC Chemical Identifier), then renamed in July 2004 to INChI (IUPAC-NIST Chemical Identifier), and renamed again in November 2004 to InChI (IUPAC International Chemical Identifier), a trademark of IUPAC.\n\n\n== Continuing development ==\nScientific direction of the InChI standard is carried out by the IUPAC Division VIII Subcommittee, and funding of subgroups investigating and defining the expansion of the standard is carried out by both IUPAC and the InChI Trust. The InChI Trust funds the development, testing and documentation of the InChI. Current extensions are being defined to handle polymers and mixtures, Markush structures, reactions and organometallics, and once accepted by the Division VIII Subcommittee will be added to the algorithm.\n\n\n== Software ==\nThe InChI Trust has developed software to generate the InChI, InChIKey and other identifiers.  The release history of this software follows.\n\n\n== Adoption ==\nThe InChI has been adopted by many larger and smaller databases, including ChemSpider, ChEMBL, Golm Metabolome Database, OpenPHACTS, and PubChem. However, the adoption is not straightforward, and many databases show a discrepancy between the chemical structures and the InChI they contain, which is a problem for linking databases.\n\n\n== See also ==\nMolecular Query Language\nSimplified molecular-input line-entry system (SMILES)\nMolecule editor\nSYBYL Line Notation\nBioclipse generates InChI and InChIKeys for drawn structures or opened files\nthe Chemistry Development Kit uses JNI-InChI to generate InChIs, can convert InChIs into structures, and generate tautomers based on the InChI algorithms\n\n\n== Notes and references ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nIUPAC InChI site\nDescription of the canonicalization algorithm\nGoogling for InChIs a presentation to the W3C.\nInChI Release 1.02 InChI final version 1.02 and explanation of Standard InChI, January 2009\nNCI/CADD Chemical Identifier Resolver Generates and resolves InChI/InChIKeys and many other chemical identifiers\nPubChem online molecule editor that supports SMILES/SMARTS and InChI\nChemSpider Compound APIs ChemSpider REST API that allows generation of InChI and conversion of InChI to structure (also SMILES and generation of other properties)\nMarvinSketch from ChemAxon, implementation to draw structures (or open other file formats) and output to InChI file format\nBKchem implements its own InChI parser and uses the IUPAC implementation to generate InChI strings\nCompoundSearch implements an InChI and InChI Key search of spectral libraries\nSpectraBase implements an InChI and InChI Key search of spectral libraries\nJSME Archived 2015-01-06 at the Wayback Machine is a free JavaScript based molecular editor that  generates  InChI and InChI Key in a web browser, which  allows for easy web searches of chemical compounds", "infobox": {"name": "InChI", "developer": "InChI Trust", "released": "{{Start date|2005|04|15}}", "latest release version": "1.06", "latest release date": "{{Start date and age|2020|12|15}}", "operating system": "[[Microsoft Windows]] and [[Unix-like]]", "platform": "[[IA-32]] and [[x86-64]]", "language": "[[English language|English]]", "license": "IUPAC / InChI Trust Licence", "website": "{{url|https://www.inchi-trust.org/}}"}, "wikidata": {"subclass of (P279)": "unique identifier (Q6545185)", "Freebase ID (P646)": "/m/06cpm3", "copyright license (P275)": "IUPAC-InChI Trust License (Q15410639)", "official website (P856)": "http://www.iupac.org/home/publications/e-resources/inchi.html", "publisher (P123)": "InChI Trust (Q6008719)", "Wikidata property (P1687)": "P234", "has use (P366)": "chemistry (Q2329)", "identifiers.org prefix (P4793)": "inchi", "topic's main template (P1424)": "Template:Chembox InChI (Q6871527)", "different from (P1889)": "InChIKey (Q21445422)"}, "cat": "Written_communication", "url": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Chemical_Identifier", "wikibase": "Q203250"}, {"name": "Pitney Bowes Inc.", "url_name": "2006843", "txt": "Pitney Bowes Inc. is an American technology company most known for its postage meters and other mailing equipment and services, and with expansions into e-commerce, software, and other technologies. The company was founded by Arthur Pitney, who invented the first commercially available postage meter, and Walter Bowes as the Pitney Bowes Postage Meter Company on April 23, 1920.The company provides mailing and shipping services, global e-commerce logistics, and financial services to approximately 750,000 customers globally, as of 2021. Pitney Bowes is a certified \"work-share partner\" of the United States Postal Service, and helps the agency sort and process 15 billion pieces of mail annually. Pitney Bowes has also commissioned surveys related to international e-commerce.Pitney Bowes is based in Stamford, Connecticut and as of October 2021 employed approximately 11,000 people worldwide.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn 1902, Arthur Pitney patented his first \"double-locking\" hand-cranked postage-stamping machine, and with patent attorney Eugene A. Rummler, founded the Pitney Postal Machine Company. In 1908, English emigrant and founder of the Universal Stamping Machine Company Walter Bowes began providing stamp-canceling machines to the United States Post Office Department. Bowes moved his operations to Stamford in 1917. These two companies merged to form the Pitney Bowes Postage Meter Company in 1920 with the invention of the first commercially available postage meter.The company created its first logo, which symbolized \"the security of the metered mail system\", in 1930. In 1950, Pitney Bowes initiated an advertising campaign in national publications with the message, \"Metered mail makes the mailer's life easier\". In 1971, the company introduced a new logo, which represented the \"intersection of paper-based and electronic communication\". Pitney Bowes was valued at around $18 billion in December 1998.In April 2003, Pitney Bowes filed a lawsuit in Seattle's King County Superior Court against Mark Browne and Howard Gray, who founded the competing company Nexxpost in 2002, as well as six other former employees, for engaging \"in transgressions ranging from misappropriation of trade secrets to violating confidentiality agreements\". The two companies reached a settlement in August 2003.By 2005, the company employed 32,500 people and the next year reported $5.7 billion in annual revenue and more than 35,000 employees. In 2008, in conjunction with other companies, Pitney Bowes donated two of its 3,400 patents to the Eco-Patent Commons, which is operated by the World Business Council for Sustainable Development, in an effort to reduce pollution. One of the patents increases the lifespan of electronic scales, reducing landfill waste, and the other is an inkjet printing technology that reduces ink use. In 2009, Pitney Bowes was named one of the world's largest software companies by Software Magazine and in December it opened its first customer innovation center in Shelton, Connecticut.In February 2012, the credit rating for Pitney Bowes International Holdings was lowered by Fitch Ratings from BBB+ to BBB. The ratings agency said its main concern was \"the downward trajectory\" of Pitney Bowes' revenue, and added that they have a \"negative outlook.\" The company sold its I.M. Pei & Partners-designed headquarters in Stamford for nearly $40 million in 2013, and relocated to a new, smaller headquarters in the city. According to the Hartford Courant, Pitney Bowes was eligible to receive as much as $27 million in subsidies over five years as part of the state's \"First Five\" program, for keeping 1,600 employees and adding 200 more. In March 2014, Moody's assigned a long-term rating of Baa2 to the company's proposed $350 million senior unsecured notes (due 2024) and reiterated their stable outlook on Pitney Bowes.In 2014, the company announced plans for a rebrand. Pitney Bowes unveiled its new logo in January 2015, replacing one used since 1971; the rebranding campaign, which included an updated website and marketing, reportedly cost between $40 million and $80 million.Pitney Bowes' 2015 profits totaled $408 million, but this declined to $95 million in profits for 2016.
