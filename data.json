[{"name": "Moriusaq Heliport", "url_name": "26587670", "txt": "Moriusaq Heliport (ICAO: BGMO) is a heliport in Moriusaq, a village in Avannaata municipality in northern Greenland. The heliport is considered a helistop, and is served by Air Greenland as part of a government contract. The village population had dwindled to 2 by 2010, and thus operations at the heliport are likely to be discontinued at any time.\n\n\n== Airlines and destinations ==\nAir Greenland operates government contract flights to villages in the Qaanaaq area. These mostly cargo flights are not featured in the timetable, although they can be pre-booked. Departure times for these flights as specified during booking are by definition approximate, with the settlement service optimized on the fly depending on local demand for a given day.\n\n\n=== Transfers at Thule Air Base ===\nTravellers bound for Thule Air Base in Pituffik are required to apply for an access permit from either Rigsombudsmanden in Nuuk (residents of Greenland) or the Danish Foreign Ministry (all others). Failure to present the permit during check-in results in denial of boarding. The same rules apply for transfers at Pituffik, including a stopover on the way from Moriusaq to Savissivik.\n\n\n== References ==", "infobox": {"name": "Moriusaq Heliport", "ICAO": "BGMO", "type": "Public", "operator": "[[Mittarfeqarfiit]]", "city-served": "[[Moriusaq]], [[Greenland]]", "elevation-f": "44", "coordinates": "{{coord|76|45|50|N|069|59|50|W|region:GL|display|=|inline,title}}", "pushpin_map": "Greenland", "pushpin_label": "BGMO", "pushpin_map_caption": "Location in Greenland"}, "wikidata": {"coordinate location (P625)": {"latitude": 76.76388889, "longitude": -69.99722222, "altitude": null, "precision": 0.00027777777777778, "globe": "http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q2"}, "Freebase ID (P646)": "/m/0bh7kcb", "instance of (P31)": ["heliport (Q502074)", "commercial traffic aerodrome (Q94993988)"], "country (P17)": "Greenland (Q223)", "ICAO airport code (P239)": "BGMO", "place served by transport hub (P931)": "Moriusaq (Q1020271)", "elevation above sea level (P2044)": {"amount": "+44", "unit": "http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q3710"}, "operator (P137)": "Greenland Airport Authority (Q3182305)", "located in the administrative territorial entity (P131)": "Avannaata (Q44593409)", "official website (P856)": "http://www.glv.gl"}, "cat": "Airports", "url": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moriusaq_Heliport"}, {"name": "Mosteiros Airport", "url_name": "40354557", "txt": "Mosteiros Airport (IATA: MTI, ICAO: GVMT) was a public use airfield near Mosteiros, in the northeastern part of the island Fogo, Cape Verde.

It is located near the town of Murmashi in Murmansk's southern suburbs, 24 kilometres (15 mi) outside the city centre. It serves as the airline hub for Smartavia.\nAs of 2019, it is the 31st busiest airport in Russia and 53st busiest airport in the former USSR. The airport served 763,668 passengers in 2016, an increase of 1.65% from 2015. In 2017 it served 845,928 passengers, an increase of 10.8% from 2016.\n\n\n== History ==\nPreviously, the airfield had military significance and was called Murmashi airfield. During the Soviet-Finnish war, the Soviet 147th fighter aviation regiment, provided with Polikarpov I-15 bis, I-16 and I-153 aircraft, was based at the airfield. After the German invasion of USSR, the 147th fighter aviation regiment performed tasks to cover Murmansk and the Kirov railway from German air raids. From July 1941, the regiment received MiG-3 aircraft, which it used until the spring of 1942. In mid-July 1941, the regiment included four MiG-3s designed to intercept enemy bombers and by the end of the month received 17 MiG-3s. In January 1942, the regiment received P-40 Tomahawk aircraft. The regiment was based at the airfield until the spring of 1945.\nIn November 2015, Novaport bought out the Murmansk Airport from its former owner, Gazprom Oil, with the aim to develop flights from the low-cost airline Pobeda to the airport.\n\n\n== Terminals ==\n\n\n=== Passenger terminal ===\nOn the ground floor of the only passenger terminal there are check-in counters, waiting room, international zone, cafes and souvenir shops. On the second floor there is a cafe, a Duty-free shop, airline representative offices and souvenir shops. The Duty-free store is located only in the international zone. The arrival zones are located on the first floors \u2014 in the right (\"arrival hall B\") and left (\"arrival hall A\") wings of the building. There is also a hall for VIP guests, where inspection and check-in takes place separately from other passengers.\n\n\n=== Cargo terminal ===\nThe cargo terminal with an area of 400 m\u00b2 is located on a fenced territory, in the area under responsibility for transport security.\n\n\n== Airlines and destinations ==\n\n\n== Statistics ==\n\n\n== Accidents and incidents ==\nOn 11 November 1965, Aeroflot Flight 99 crashed while on approach to Murmansk Airport. 32 of the 64 passengers and crew on board were killed in the accident.\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\nIn the novel The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul by Douglas Adams, it is stated that Murmansk Airport is the only airport that is not full of tired, cross people who have found that their luggage is in Murmansk Airport. The airport also briefly serves as a location in the Alex Rider novel Skeleton Key by Anthony Horowitz.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nList of the busiest airports in Russia\nList of the busiest airports in Europe\nList of the busiest airports in the former USSR\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website", "infobox": {"name": "Emperor Nicholas II Murmansk Airport", "nativename-a": "{{lang|ru|\u0410\u044d\u0440\u043e\u043f\u043e\u0440\u0442 \u041c\u0443\u0440\u043c\u0430\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0430 \u0438\u043c. \u041d\u0438\u043a\u043e\u043b\u0430\u044f II}}", "image": "Murmansk_Airport_logo.png", "image2": "Murmansk (MMK - ULMM) AN1445818.jpg", "image2-width": "250", "IATA": "MMK", "ICAO": "ULMM", "LID": "\u041c\u0423\u041d", "type": "Public", "operator": "JSC \"Airport Murmansk\"", "city-served": "[[Murmansk]], [[Russia]]", "location": "[[Murmashi]], [[Russia]]", "coordinates": "{{coord|68|47|01.68|N|032|45|21.41|E|region:RU|display|=|inline,title}}", "website": "[http://airport-murmansk.ru/ airport-murmansk.ru]", "pushpin_map": "Russia Murmansk Oblast#European Russia#Europe", "pushpin_map_caption": "Location of the airport in Murmansk Oblast##Location of the airport in Russia##Location of the airport in Europe", "pushpin_label": "MMK", "r1-number": "13/31", "r1-length-f": "8,202", "r1-length-m": "2,500", "r1-surface": "Paved", "stat-year": "2018", "stat1-header": "Passengers", "stat1-data": "938,022", "footnotes": "Sources:  Russian Federal Air Transport Agency (see also provisional 2018 statistics)"}, "wikidata": {"Commons category (P373)": "Murmansk Airport", "instance of (P31)": ["airport (Q1248784)", "commercial traffic aerodrome (Q94993988)", "federal aeroport (Q106643740)"], "IATA airport code (P238)": "MMK", "ICAO airport code (P239)": "ULMM", "coordinate location (P625)": {"latitude": 68.7838, "longitude": 32.755947222222, "altitude": null, "precision": 0.00027777777777778, "globe": "http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q2"}, "country (P17)": "Russia (Q159)", "Freebase ID (P646)": "/m/026l5y8", "GeoNames ID (P1566)": "6300972", "official website (P856)": "http://www.airport-murmansk.ru", "image (P18)": "Murmansk Airport-2021 - 1.jpeg", "place served by transport hub (P931)": "Murmansk (Q1763)", "named after (P138)": ["Nicholas II of Russia (Q40787)", "Murmansk (Q1763)"], "operator (P137)": "Murmansk Airlines (Q3841201)", "elevation above sea level (P2044)": {"amount": "+81", "unit": "http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q11573"}, "located in the administrative territorial entity (P131)": "Murmansk (Q1763)", "runway (P529)": "13/31", "Ex-USSR internal airport code (P5851)": "\u041c\u0423\u041d", "patronage (P3872)": [{"amount": "+938022", "unit": "1"}, {"amount": "+763668", "unit": "1"}, {"amount": "+845928", "unit": "1"}, {"amount": "+752488", "unit": "1"}, {"amount": "+667065", "unit": "1"}, {"amount": "+61411", "unit": "1"}, {"amount": "+545073", "unit": "1"}, {"amount": "+550311", "unit": "1"}, {"amount": "+67783", "unit": "1"}, {"amount": "+67398", "unit": "1"}, {"amount": "+68931", "unit": "1"}, {"amount": "+67860", "unit": "1"}, {"amount": "+76468", "unit": "1"}, {"amount": "+82918", "unit": "1"}, {"amount": "+96476", "unit": "1"}, {"amount": "+97551", "unit": "1"}, {"amount": "+88007", "unit": "1"}, {"amount": "+72713", "unit": "1"}, {"amount": "+71326", "unit": "1"}, {"amount": "+80591", "unit": "1"}, {"amount": "+77851", "unit": "1"}, {"amount": "+79519", "unit": "1"}, {"amount": "+79915", "unit": "1"}, {"amount": "+73623", "unit": "1"}, {"amount": "+80823", "unit": "1"}, {"amount": "+91226", "unit": "1"}, {"amount": "+99508", "unit": "1"}, {"amount": "+98506", "unit": "1"}, {"amount": "+89007", "unit": "1"}, {"amount": "+83548", "unit": "1"}, {"amount": "+80060", "unit": "1"}, {"amount": "+96075", "unit": "1"}, {"amount": "+98066", "unit": "1"}, {"amount": "+84717", "unit": "1"}, {"amount": "+75587", "unit": "1"}, {"amount": "+11659", "unit": "1"}, {"amount": "+19032", "unit": "1"}, {"amount": "+57430", "unit": "1"}, {"amount": "+92840", "unit": "1"}, {"amount": "+113462", "unit": "1"}, {"amount": "+102801", "unit": "1"}, {"amount": "+87207", "unit": "1"}, {"amount": "+71670", "unit": "1"}, {"amount": "+85364", "unit": "1"}, {"amount": "+899835", "unit": "1"}, {"amount": "+1355612", "unit": "1"}], "Who's on First ID (P6766)": "102539783"}, "cat": "Airports", "url": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murmansk_Airport"}, {"name": "(Del Bonita/Whetstone International Airport)", "url_name": "3624701", "txt": "Whetstone International Airport or Del Bonita/Whetstone International Airport (FAA LID: H28, TC LID: CEQ4) is a public use airport at the Canada\u2013US border, in Port of Del Bonita, Glacier County, Montana, 2 nautical miles (4 km; 2 mi) south of Del Bonita, Cardston County, Alberta.

Ajman is surrounded on its landlocked north, south and eastern borders by Sharjah. The airport is being constructed in the eastern district of Ajman, in the Al Manama enclave. This construction project is one worth $571 million which is forecasted to accommodate for 1 million passengers and a minimum of 400,000 tonnes of cargo when completed. It has an expected completion date of late 2020. This is set to enable more accessible travel to Ajman and encourages development on the surrounding area with plans to expand and open hotels, restaurants, commercial offices, residential units, retail, educational centres and exhibition halls. According to a feasibility study by ICTS Europe and Booz Allen Hamilton (BAH) new construction project is set to achieve more than 1 million passengers within the first three years of opening and operating.As of February 2021, construction has not started yet and the project is probably canceled or on hold.\n\n\n== Location ==\n\nAjman International Airport will be located in the smallest emirate of the United Arab Emirates, Ajman. Ajman is landlocked in the north, south and eastern borders by Sharjah which is the current closest international airport to Ajman. The new airport facility is being constructed with an area of 60 million square feet, 60 km away from Ajman City, in the eastern district of Ajman, in the Al Manama enclave, linking Fujairah on the east coast and Sharjah on the west coast. The site is in a location in the heart of the Northern Emirates and connected by the existing road infrastructure to other emirates.\nCurrently, to engage in international travel, residents of Ajman must travel hours to Dubai and Sharjah to the nearest airport. This further applies to imports and export cargo. This construction project allows for the ease of import and exports of goods to and from Ajman and global destinations.As 90% of the population currently resides in the city, the Ajman International Airport will help facilitate a wider spread of the population within the emirate along the city and Al Manama enclave.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Government of Ajman granted White Lake Consortium (WLC) the initial sole concession to design, build and operate the upcoming airport. Other corporations involved in this construction project are ICTS Europe, Steel Law, Booz Allen Hamilton (BAH) and Fakhruddin Group, a United Arab Emirates based developer. In September 2014, the Crown Prince of Ajman, Prince Sheikh Ammar Bin Humaid Al Nuaimi provided final approval to Whitelake Consortium (WLC) to build and operate the proposed Ajman International Airport development plan which is approximately AED1.2 billion (US$570 million). The first phase of the construction project was set to build the initial terminal buildings for departures and arrivals, runways, a cargo complex, aviation school, maintenance workshops, free zone and a commercial zone. The new airport was to have capacity for 1 million passengers annually by 2018. This was to increase Ajman's tourism numbers within the emirate.In February 2015, the CEO of the Ajman International Airport, Rashidi Omrani claimed the airport was still to be expected to be completed in 2018. This construction project was said to include extra space for a large MRO centre and a terminal with capacity even greater than 1 million passengers. Delays in the construction of the airport constantly occurring has led to the new completion date to be by 31 December 2020.The facilities of this airport have been designed, with a 4000-metre-long runway, to accept aircraft like the Airbus A380. To expand airport usage facilities to serve the needs of the air cargo and logistics, maintenance and executive aircraft operations will be created.\n\n\n== Operations ==\nThe Ajman International Airport has operational guidelines based upon those of surrounding emirates. However, further intervention as well as experimentation once the airport begins operating is required due to the high amount of air traffic with limited air space in the United Arab Emirates.\n\n\n=== Facilities ===\nIn these early stages of construction and opening, twenty-five airlines including Emirates, Etihad and Air Arabia have sent letters of intent for landing rights at this airport. To accommodate for employees of the airport as well as other investments in the airport area, multiple residential and commercial properties will be developed alongside this as the airport will be located 60 km outside the Ajman city. The Ajman International Airport has provoked further construction such as retailers and restaurants in the surrounding area which is able to accommodate to staff of the airport due to the airport's profound distance from the main city centre and residential units. This further accommodates to tourists on limited time layovers which in turn, boosts economic activity in the emirate.\n\n\n=== Flight movements ===\n\nAjman International Airport, after its initial completion will begin with transporting cargo then with flying passengers to other emirates within the United Arab Emirates and will then further begin its international flights as the domestic flights run smoothly to alleviate any issues with the function and processes. After initial flights, this will further extend passenger flights internationally. However, as this construction project is not set to be a large international airport to the measure of that of other emirates in the United Arab Emirates, international flights will be limited to closer destinations and accommodate to layovers.\n\n\n=== Regulation ===\nThe director of the Aviation Authority, Saif, Al Suwaidi stated that the approval for the operations of the airport in Ajman require evaluating the common airspace and agreements among the other airports operating in the other emirates of the United Arab Emirates including Dubai, Abu Dhabi, Sharjah, Ras Al Khaimah and Fujairah. The close proximity of these five airports poses major challenges for the establishment of the Ajman International airport due to the limited airspace. The Aviation Authority is in the process of holding meetings with all airports, more specifically, in the north of the United Arab Emirates such as Dubai, Sharjah and Ras Al Khaimah to continue achieving the highest level of safety for air traffic in the country. This will be further tested and implemented in the initial stages of opening and running the airport with beginning in low cost carrier (LCC) and cargo transportation as the primary use. Through testing and enforcing different regulations in cargo transportation, the airport will further begin to engage in other functions and processes, including passenger travel.\n\n\n=== Security ===\nAjman International Airport, being part of the United Arab Emirates will follow after its neighbouring emirates such as Dubai and Abu Dhabi in terms of the security measures taken when entering the country. This further includes restrictions on fire, explosives, illicit substances and guns. This further extends to carry on luggage in terms of liquid, sharp objects and flammable item restrictions. Furthermore, similar to that of Abu Dhabi International Airport and Dubai International Airport, passengers engaging in layover flights will also have security measures with carry on luggage x-ray scanners and walk through metal detectors regardless of whether they will be exiting the Ajman International Airport to go to Ajman itself.\n\n\n== Airlines and Destinations ==\n\n\n=== Passengers ===\nAfter its opening in 2021, when passengers are able to fly, Ajman International Airport, is set to cater to a minimum of one million passengers per annum and is estimated to rise up to 10.4 million by 2046. This airport is set to be driven largely by low cost carrier (LCC) and cargo operations in the first initial phase of its opening, the new airport is projected to achieve a significant amount of international passenger traffic over five years of it opening. However, 70% of its air traffic is set to come from low cost carriers (LCC) and 30% from regional flights. Although Ajman International Airport is set to cater to this large amount, it is not set to be equal to the measure of airports of other larger emirates such as Abu Dhabi and Dubai, specifically in passenger transportation.\n\n\n=== Cargo ===\nAfter the opening of the airport, Ajman International Airport intends on beginning its processes and functions with cargo. This allows for the airport to further assess efficiency of the airport's functionality and make improvements fit for passengers to begin travel. Ajman International Airport will accommodate a minimum of 400,000 tonnes of cargo. Due to the emirate's smaller size in terms of area and population, the airport is set to also be smaller than that of neighbouring emirates such as Dubai International Airport and Sharjah International Airport. Therefore, cargo and airport maintenance are set to make up most of the airport's business. This further facilitates trade to occur within the United Arab Emirates and boost the economy by adding additional trading ports, specifically, the Ajman International Airport.\n\n\n== Access ==\nDue to the surrounding construction of residential units to occur around the Ajman International Airport, the commute is set to be quick for locals living in the surrounding area. However, this may be difficult for locals living in Ajman City as the airport construction site is 60 km away from the main city. Due to the minimal public transport available in Ajman, the airport will be accessible mainly by private cars and taxis, specifically for those living in the city. Currently, due to the lack of air transportation in existence in Ajman, residents are required to travel to Sharjah airport, one hour away or Dubai airport, one and a half hours away via a car or one bus from Ajman to Dubai which runs hourly. Ajman is only 12 km from Sharjah Airport which is the major base for Air Arabia from where approximately 19 airlines operated more than 35,000 scheduled flights in 2017. The current large air transportation hub of Dubai International Airport is a further 15 km away with one of the world's largest passenger air transportation, approximately 81 scheduled passenger airlines and 199,000 flights in 2017.\n\n\n== Future Expansions and Plans ==\n\nA feasibility study was conducted by ICTS Europe, an aviation specialist and Booz Allen Hamilton (BAH), an international consultancy firm. According to His Highness Shaikh Humaid Bun Rashid Al Nuaimi, member of the Supreme Council and Ruler of the emirate of Ajman, after reviewing the feasibility study, claims the new airport construction project aims to meet the growing demand for aviation infrastructure in the United Arab Emirates. As the Ajman International airport brings more people into this emirate and boosts tourism as well as occupancy of resorts, further expansions and developments of the area will occur. Although this airport does not aim to compete with other larger airports in the country, it aims to further contribute to tourism revenue with a considerable number of hotels also growing in recent years. Tourism in Ajman has been undergoing rapid growth after recovering from the financial crisis in 2007-2008. Popular attractions and locations for tourists, facilitating this rapid growth, include the Ajman National Museum located at Ajman Fort, the Red fort and the museum in the inland enclave of Manama, near where the construction site of the new airport is situated. Ajman's corniche is also a popular tourist destination for families, contributing to this rapid tourism growth, featuring a number of fast food retailers, coffee shops and stalls. Expatriates of Ajman often venture to the \u2018Outside Inn,\u2019 a popular watering hole which also possesses a number of hotels such as Ramada, Ajman Palace, the Kempinski the Ajman Saray and the Fairmont Ajman which further boosts economic upturn from tourism in Ajman.This airport will be open for big businesses and allows to provide more income for the emirate. This airport is estimated to create over 28,000 new jobs such as border security, taxi drivers, retailers, flight attendants, builders and pilots. The United Arab Emirates plans to invest $USD136 billion in aviation infrastructure in the next 10 years and has an estimate of 15 million to tourists by 2020. Taking into consideration this growth in tourism, this airport construction project, aims to expand and open more hotels, restaurants, commercial offices, residential units, retailers, educational centres and exhibition halls. The additional construction projects to come in response to the Ajman International Airport are further set to boost the overall economy for the emirate alongside the airport.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nhttp://www.arabianbusiness.com/ajman-crown-prince-approves-571m-airport-plans-564682.html\nhttp://www.dubaifaqs.com/ajman-airport.php\nhttp://www.thenational.ae/uae/transport/residents-and-businesses-welcome-plans-for-airport-in-ajman\nhttp://www.constructionweekonline.com/projects-162-ajman_international_airport/\nhttp://meconstructionnews.com/8944/top-10-gulf-airport-projects\nhttp://gulfnews.com/business/aviation/ajman-builds-new-airport-and-two-ports-1.1338993", "infobox": {"name": "Ajman International Airport", "nativename-a": "\u0645\u0637\u0627\u0631 \u0639\u062c\u0645\u0627\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u062f\u0648\u0644\u064a", "image": "20 airtransportation inv.svg", "IATA": "QAJ", "type": "Public", "owner": "Whitelake Consortium", "city-served": "[[Ajman]], United Arab Emirates", "location": "[[Manama, Ajman|Manama]], [[Ajman]]"}, "wikidata": {"instance of (P31)": "proposed airport/being built (Q44665966)", "IATA airport code (P238)": "QAJ", "coordinate location (P625)": {"latitude": 25.310277777778, "longitude": 55.9925, "altitude": null, "precision": 0.00027777777777778, "globe": "http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q2"}, "Freebase ID (P646)": "/m/03gwc6k", "GeoNames ID (P1566)": "8532996", "country (P17)": "United Arab Emirates (Q878)", "place served by transport hub (P931)": "Ajman (Q530171)", "named after (P138)": "Ajman (Q530171)", "located in the administrative territorial entity (P131)": "Ajman (Q530171)", "image (P18)": "20 airtransportation inv.svg", "state of use (P5817)": "proposed building or structure (Q811683)"}, "cat": "Airports", "url": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajman_International_Airport"}, {"name": "Ajman International Airport", "url_name": "14745087", "txt": "Ajman International Airport (Arabic: \u0645\u0637\u0627\u0631 \u0639\u062c\u0645\u0627\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u062f\u0648\u0644\u064a) was an upcoming airport which is currently a construction project in Ajman, the smallest emirate of the United Arab Emirates.

The additional construction projects to come in response to the Ajman International Airport are further set to boost the overall economy for the emirate alongside the airport.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nhttp://www.arabianbusiness.com/ajman-crown-prince-approves-571m-airport-plans-564682.html\nhttp://www.dubaifaqs.com/ajman-airport.php\nhttp://www.thenational.ae/uae/transport/residents-and-businesses-welcome-plans-for-airport-in-ajman\nhttp://www.constructionweekonline.com/projects-162-ajman_international_airport/\nhttp://meconstructionnews.com/8944/top-10-gulf-airport-projects\nhttp://gulfnews.com/business/aviation/ajman-builds-new-airport-and-two-ports-1.1338993", "infobox": {"name": "Ajman International Airport", "nativename-a": "\u0645\u0637\u0627\u0631 \u0639\u062c\u0645\u0627\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u062f\u0648\u0644\u064a", "image": "20 airtransportation inv.svg", "IATA": "QAJ", "type": "Public", "owner": "Whitelake Consortium", "city-served": "[[Ajman]], United Arab Emirates", "location": "[[Manama, Ajman|Manama]], [[Ajman]]"}, "wikidata": {"instance of (P31)": "proposed airport/being built (Q44665966)", "IATA airport code (P238)": "QAJ", "coordinate location (P625)": {"latitude": 25.310277777778, "longitude": 55.9925, "altitude": null, "precision": 0.00027777777777778, "globe": "http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q2"}, "Freebase ID (P646)": "/m/03gwc6k", "GeoNames ID (P1566)": "8532996", "country (P17)": "United Arab Emirates (Q878)", "place served by transport hub (P931)": "Ajman (Q530171)", "named after (P138)": "Ajman (Q530171)", "located in the administrative territorial entity (P131)": "Ajman (Q530171)", "image (P18)": "20 airtransportation inv.svg", "state of use (P5817)": "proposed building or structure (Q811683)"}, "cat": "Airports", "url": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajman_International_Airport"}, {"name": "Engel\u00f8y flyplass, Gr\u00e5dussan", "url_name": "32057915", "txt": "Engel\u00f8y Airport, Gr\u00e5dussan (Norwegian: Engel\u00f8y flyplass, Gr\u00e5dussan) (ICAO: ENEN) is an airport located on the northwest tip of Engel\u00f8ya, an island in Steigen municipality, Nordland county, Norway.\nThe airport was built in 2009 and opened in earnest in 2010.

The character was created by cartoonist Charles Addams in 1933.\n\n\n== Cartoons ==\nMorticia first appeared in Charles Addams' newspaper cartoons as the stern, aloof matriarch of the family. She often appeared with the rest of the family, and was, along with Gomez and Grandmama, one of the few members to actually speak in the cartoons.\n\n\n== Background ==\nMorticia is the wife of Gomez Addams and mother of Wednesday, Pugsley and Pubert Addams. The character originated in the Charles Addams cartoons for The New Yorker magazine in the 1930s. In the cartoons, none of the family members had names. When the characters were adapted to the 1964 television series, Charles Addams' selection of her name was inspired by \"mortician\". Morticia's maiden name is \"Frump\" and she has an older sister named Ophelia (also played by Carolyn Jones in the original TV series). In the television series, her mother (Uncle Fester's sister) was named Hester Frump (played by Margaret Hamilton). Her mother-in-law is Grandmama Addams. In the 1990s Addams Family films, familial relationships are changed for the characters of Grandmama and Fester. Grandmama is actually Morticia's mother, not Gomez's, while Fester is Gomez's brother, not Morticia's uncle.\n\n The real head of the family ... low-voiced, incisive and subtle, smiles are rare...ruined beauty ... contemptuous and original and with fierce family loyalty ... even in disposition, muted, witty, sometimes deadly ... given to low-keyed rhapsodies about her garden of deadly nightshade, henbane and dwarf\u2019s hair ... \nMorticia is described as a witch; she is slim, with extremely pale skin and long flowing straight black hair. In one episode she is seen wearing a black pointed hat. She commonly wears black hobble dresses to match her hair, tightly form fitting, with a fringe of octopus-like cloth \"tentacles\" at the lower hem. According to Wednesday, Morticia applies baking powder to her face instead of actual makeup. In each episode, she easily allures her husband Gomez by speaking French (or any other foreign language for that matter). Morticia is musically inclined, and is often seen freely strumming a Japanese shamisen. She frequently enjoys cutting the buds off of roses, which she discards (keeping only the stems), likes cutting out paper dolls with three heads and making sweaters with three arms, collecting the mail from the hand-in-the-box Thing, and cooking unusual concoctions for her husband, including eye of newt. Her personal pet is Cleopatra, a fictitious breed of carnivorous plant called an African Strangler, to which she feeds hamburgers and various other meats.\nMorticia's family tree can be traced back to Salem, Massachusetts, and witchcraft is also implied at times in the television series.  For example, Morticia likes to \"smoke,\" an activity that does not involve cigarettes or cigars (such as her husband frequently enjoys), but smoke instead emanates from below her.In 2009, she was included in Yahoo!'s Top 10 TV Moms from Six Decades of Television for the time period 1964\u20131966. AOL named her one of the 100 Most Memorable Female TV Characters.\n\n\n== In other media ==\n\nMorticia was portrayed by Carolyn Jones in the TV series, and Halloween with the New Addams Family TV movie, and by Anjelica Huston in The Addams Family and its sequel Addams Family Values. Huston's portrayal of Morticia was always illuminated by a ghostly glow around the eyes, which became most noticeable when she was standing or lying in dim light.  Daryl Hannah played Morticia in the 1998 film Addams Family Reunion. Canadian actress Ellie Harvie played Morticia in the revival series, The New Addams Family. In the first animated series made in 1973, Morticia was voiced by Janet Waldo. Jones also voiced this character in an episode of The New Scooby-Doo Movies that featured the family. In the 1992 animated series, she was voiced by Nancy Linari. In the 2010 Broadway musical, Morticia was portrayed by Bebe Neuwirth. Brooke Shields replaced her in the role of Morticia on June 28, 2011.\nMorticia was also one of the inspirations for the Walt Disney character Magica De Spell, first designed and drawn by Carl Barks. Natasha Fatale, a villain from the Rocky and Bullwinkle cartoons, was also based on Morticia's design.Morticia is voiced by Charlize Theron in The Addams Family (2019). Theron reprised her role in the sequel, which was released on October 1, 2021.\nCatherine Zeta-Jones will portray Morticia in upcoming Netflix series Wednesday.\n\n\n== Relationships ==\n\n\n=== Family tree ===\n\n\n== See also ==\nVampira\nElvira\nLily Munster\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nMorticia Addams at the IMDb (Archived)", "infobox": {"colour": "#44ff00", "name": "Morticia Addams", "series": "[[The Addams Family]]", "image": "Morticia adams origional.jpg", "caption": "[[Carolyn Jones]] as Morticia Addams in the 1960s television series", "creator": "[[Charles Addams]]", "portrayer": "[[Carolyn Jones]] (1964 series)<br/>[[Anjelica Huston]] (1991 & 1993 films)<br/>[[Daryl Hannah]] (''[[Addams Family Reunion]]'')<br/>[[Ellie Harvie]] (''[[The New Addams Family]]'')<br/>[[Bebe Neuwirth]], [[Brooke Shields]] ([[The Addams Family (musical)|2010 musical]])<br/>[[Catherine Zeta-Jones]] (''[[Wednesday (TV series)|Wednesday]]'')", "voice": "[[Janet Waldo]] ([[The Addams Family (1973 TV series)|1973 animated series]])<br>[[Nancy Linari]] ([[The Addams Family (1992 TV series)|1992 animated series]])<br>[[Charlize Theron]] ([[The Addams Family (2019 film)|2019]] and [[The Addams Family 2|2021]] films)", "spouse": "[[Gomez Addams]] (husband)<br/>Rupert Styx (ex-fianc\u00e9)", "children": "[[Wednesday Addams]] (daughter)<br>[[Pugsley Addams]] (son)<br>[[Pubert Addams]] \n(youngest son, ''[[Addams Family Values]]'')<br>[[Halloween with the New Addams Family#Cast|Wednesday Jr.]] (youngest daughter, ''[[Halloween with the New Addams Family]]'')<br>[[Halloween with the New Addams Family#Cast|Pugsley Jr.]] (youngest son, ''Halloween with the New Addams Family'')", "family": "[[Uncle Fester]] (brother-in-law or uncle, depending on the version)<br/>[[Grandmama Addams]] (mother or mother in law, depending on the version)<br/>[[Ophelia Frump]] (sister)<br/>[[Cousin Itt]] (cousin-in-law)<br/> Debbie Addams (n\u00e9e Jellinsky) (sister-in-law, ''[[Addams Family Values]]'')"}, "wikidata": {"family name (P734)": ["Addams (Q352821)", "Frump (Q37252684)"], "instance of (P31)": ["fictional human (Q15632617)", "film character (Q15773347)", "television character (Q15773317)", "animated character (Q15711870)", "comics character (Q1114461)"], "sex or gender (P21)": "female (Q6581072)", "Freebase ID (P646)": "/m/03kz60", "spouse (P26)": "Gomez Addams (Q500477)", "child (P40)": ["Pugsley Addams (Q1460860)", "Wednesday Addams (Q2575084)"], "creator (P170)": "Charles Addams (Q361106)", "mother (P25)": "Hester Frump (Q106545748)", "present in work (P1441)": "The Addams Family (Q266532)", "part of (P361)": "The Addams Family (Q3817916)", "Commons category (P373)": "Morticia Addams", "Comic Vine ID (P5905)": "4005-37518", "given name (P735)": "somevalue", "performer (P175)": ["Carolyn Jones (Q238895)", "Anjelica Huston (Q190998)", "Daryl Hannah (Q207596)", "Ellie Harvie (Q434572)", "Catherine Zeta-Jones (Q47664)"], "image (P18)": "Carolyn Jones John Astin The Addams Family 1964.JPG"}, "cat": "Comics_characters", "url": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morticia_Addams"}, {"name": "Motoko Kusanagi", "url_name": "1691883", "txt": "Major Motoko Kusanagi (Japanese: \u8349\u8599 \u7d20\u5b50, Hepburn: Kusanagi Motoko), or just \"Major\", is the main protagonist in Masamune Shirow's Ghost in the Shell manga and anime series. She is a synthetic \"full-body prosthesis\" augmented-cybernetic human employed as the field commander of Public Security Section 9, a fictional anti-cybercrime law-enforcement division of the Japanese National Public Safety Commission. Being strong-willed, physically powerful, and highly intelligent, she is well known for her skills in deduction, hacking and military tactics.\n\n\n== Conception and creation ==\nMotoko Kusanagi's body was designed by the manga author and artist Masamune Shirow to be a mass production model so she would not be conspicuous. Her electrical and mechanical system within is special and features parts unavailable on the civilian market. Shirow intentionally chose this appearance so Motoko would not be harvested for those parts.\n\n\n=== Character ===\nIn the 1995 anime film adaptation, character designer and key animator supervisor Hiroyuki Okiura, made her different from her original manga counterpart stating, \"Motoko Kusanagi is a cyborg. Therefore her body is strong and youthful. However her human mentality is considerably older than she looks. I tried to depict this maturity in her character instead of the original girl created by Masamune Shirow.\" In nearly all portrayals, Kusanagi is depicted as a self-made woman. She is a fiercely independent and capable leader who has proven herself under fire countless times.\nKenji Kamiyama had a difficult time identifying her and could not understand her motives during the first season of the anime series Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex. Due to this, he created an episode in the second season where he recounted her past. He was then able to describe her as a human who was chosen to gain this superhuman power; she probably believes that she has an obligation to use that ability for the benefit of others. English voice actor and director Mary Elizabeth McGlynn states she loved playing the role of Motoko Kusanagi and described her as \"someone [who] was that strong, and still kind of feminine at times, but also kick-ass\".\n\n\n=== Abilities ===\nNeurobiology, cybernetics and computer technology have advanced to such a point that most people possess \"neuro-cyberbrains\"\u2014a technological \"organic-synthetic\" wetware computer user interface implant located in the suboccipital nerve region of the cranium; this allows their minds to seamlessly interact with mobile devices, machines or networks around them. The neuro-cyberbrain revolutionized education and has made training in any task simply a matter of uploading the proper data. The military uses the technology to train their soldiers into veterans within days. Civilians use it to become adept at their jobs and learn new hobbies. In some cases of extreme trauma, it is possible to replace large segments of the brain and body with prosthetic counterparts.\nMajor Motoko Kusanagi is one such person, living in a full-body prosthesis after an accident as a child; her only organic parts are her brain and spinal cord. Her current prosthetic body looks like a generic product, but is actually military grade.\nIn every anime iteration, Section 9 has been all-male excepting the Major who leads the team. The Arise series details Kusanagi forming the current team roster to her own specifications. She forms and leads Section 9 because she is the most capable member of the team.\nKusanagi is a leading expert in fourth-generation warfare and cyberbrain combative warfare. As the most heavily mechanized member of Section 9, she is regarded among her peers as the best hand-to-hand melee fighter and the most skilled \"hacker and net diver.\" Chief Aramaki described her abilities as \"...rarer than 'ESP'; the kind of person that government agencies hire to assassinate without leaving a trace.\" Classified as \"Wizard Class\" grey hat, her computer security hacking skills allow her brain\u2013computer interface consciousness to control two-external humanoid \"drone\"-robots remotely with the ability to move her \"ghost\" from host to host. Kusanagi repeatedly demonstrates uncanny ability to hack people's wetware protected with military-grade malware protection and counter-measures, allowing her to \"see through their eyes,\" disable their vocal systems, or even take control of their bodies altogether. As a cyborg, Kusanagi is able to perform numerous superhuman feats, such as demonstrating superhuman strength, leaping between skyscrapers, advanced acrobatics, or shooting down a bullet after it was fired at mid-range.\n\n\n=== Background ===\nLittle is known of Motoko Kusanagi's early history. Only hints at some of her background, usually through flashbacks, and nearly always from the points of view of others; rarely from Kusanagi's herself. The Stand Alone Complex television series, establishes that Motoko Kusanagi has lived within cyborg \u201cshells\u201d practically since birth. The Arise video series confirms that Motoko Kusanagi earned her military rank \u201cMajor\u201d by serving in the JGSDF. Motoko Kusanagi earned her reputation as \u201cFire Starter,\u201d a master computer hacker, through years of experience and activity. Kusanagi is often portrayed wearing provocative dress and attire (or lack of attire) and experiments with \"human vices\" in an attempt to understand that part of her humanity, and in particular her femininity.\nKusanagi's various incarnations in the different manga or movies or TV series all portray her differently. In the original manga, Kusanagi's portrayal differs from that of the film-versions; she has a much more slapstick, vivacious, and sexy personality. Since each of these have independent storylines, the physical and mental characteristics of Motoko Kusanagi has been modified in different ways to reflect the focus of the story; these changes are reflected in the different ways that artists draw her.\nIn the 2nd Gig episode \"Kusanagi's Labyrinth \u2013 AFFECTION\" portrays a youthful Kusanagi was involved in a plane crash, the only other survivor of which was Hideo Kuze who later became a member of the \"Individual Eleven\". After spending an undefined period of time in a coma Kusanagi's \"ghost\" was transferred into a fully cybernetic-prosthetic body without her prior consent. After this she visited Hideo Kuze in hospital since he was still paralysed from the injuries he had suffered in the crash and eventually convinced him to undergo the cyberization procedure himself. At the end of the series Kusanagi confessed that she couldn't remember what her real name was, indicating that Motoko Kusanagi is actually only a pseudonym as Chroma, Fire Starter or Mira Killian; just as Hideo Kuze's name is as well.\n\n\n=== Relationships ===\nIn Ghost in the Shell, Kusanagi participates in a lesbian sex splash panel, involving Kurutan and Ran, and has a boyfriend. The unnamed boyfriend works for Section One, and they have been dating for seven months; to which Batou considers this \"a new record\". In Ghost in the Shell S.A.C. 2nd GIG, Episode 17 \u2013 \"DI Mother and Child \u2013 RED DATA\", having taken an adolescent male to a hotel after rescuing him from yakuza, both share the same bed for the night. The boy asks Motoko if cyborgs can still have sex, to which Motoko responds \"You care to find out?\"\nMotoko shares a strong bond and respect with her partner Batou, to whom which she work with in several missions, its heavily implied the two are in love with one another.\nHeterosexual \"E-sex\" is rather painful, as depicted in the splash panel. It is also an illegal act and lucrative \"side business\" for Motoko, as stated by Masamune Shirow in the back of the manga collection. \"Same gender/sex\" cyborg-compatibility are rarely an issue, as the user(s)' interfaced nervous systems allow shared simultaneous sensations; such intimate connections have the potential for serious medical complications for user(s) of \"Opposing sex/gender\" compatibility, as illustrated by the accidental arrival of Batou (who is male).  Shirow stated in his poster-book, Intron Depot 1, that \"I drew an all-girl orgy because I didn't want to draw some guy's butt.\" The lesbian sex splash panel was cut from the original American release of the manga, as it would have entailed giving the book an \"adults only\" rating. Ultimately, Shirow decided it wasn't important to the plot. In the second edition, released in 2004, the scene is completely unedited.\n\n\n== Appearances ==\n\n\n=== In print ===\n\n\n==== Manga series ====\nMotoko is a commanding presence when on assignment, but also trades insults with her troops. She constantly calls Aramaki \"Ape Face\" as well as other members in Public Security Section 9, and when the Puppet Master reveals the \"Motokos\" that exist in the minds of those who know her, Aramaki's \"Motoko\" is sticking her tongue out. She is very light-hearted and immature on some occasions. Due to the Puppeteer case, she started to change and became much more serious.\nIn the sequel, Ghost in the Shell 2: Man/Machine Interface, a person known as Motoko Aramaki appears. She identifies herself as containing \"Motoko Kusanagi\" elements, along with Project 2501, the Puppeteer. She is also identified as \"Motoko 11\" hinting that there is more than one.\nA second character is also introduced in Ghost in the Shell 2: Man/Machine Interface named Millennium, who controls a group named \"Stabat Mater\" that is researching a process known as \"Brain Expansion\". This research is apparently called off after Millennium is taken over by Motoko Aramaki. At this time Millennium is revealed to be \"'No. 20' (Millennium),\" indicating that Millennium is another of the Motoko Kusanagi/Project 2501 hybrid entities.\n\n\n=== In film ===\n\n\n==== Animated films ====\nIn the 1995 animated film Ghost in the Shell by Mamoru Oshii, the Major's design is significantly different from her original manga appearance. Unlike her manga counterpart, the Major has an androgynous face and rarely shows emotion. Like the manga, Public Security Section 9 investigate the crimes of a genius hacker called the Puppet Master. Kusanagi is frequently portrayed in the film as contemplative and brooding, in contrast to the down-to-earth nature of her partner Batou. Since she has a full cybernetic body, she is not certain her \"ghost\" retains any humanity and speculates on the possibility that she is entirely synthetic intelligence, with artificially generated memories and emotions designed to \"fool her\" into thinking she was once human. Throughout the movie, she seeks to find answers to her questions and finally meets the Puppet Master, a rogue AI who became sentient and who is also looking for existential meaning. In the climax of the film, Kusanagi and the Puppet Master \"merge\" to form a \"newborn\": an entirely new entity that exists free of physical boundaries and can propagate itself through the Net.\nIn the 2004 follow-up Ghost in the Shell 2: Innocence, picking up three years after the events of the original movie, the Major herself does not appear. Throughout the film, the Major makes her first \"true\" appearance in Kim's manor, where she breaks into the hallway component of Kim's looping false memories and inserts herself (represented by the child's prosthetic body she inhabited at the end of the first movie), and provides clues to alert Batou to Kim's attempted \"ghost-hack\" on himself and Togusa. The Major's \"ghost\" eventually returns in person to help Batou on the Locus Solus gynoid factory ship. Using a satellite transmission, she attempts to download her \"ghost\" into one of the Hadaly gynoid production models\u2014however, due to the insufficient memory of the gynoid's e-brain, she is only able to download a fraction of her full \"ghost\" into the doll. (She notes with marked disdain that the gynoid had barely enough memory for her combat protocols.) Her personality has not changed much from the first movie\u2014she still retains her fondness for philosophy and her considerable skills in battle, though she has also gained the Puppet Master's formidable hacking abilities. In a climactic sequence, she tears apart her mechanical body in the process of opening the ship's CPU hatch in order to hack into it. After successfully locking down the ship and uncovering the truth behind the conspiracy, Kusanagi prepares to once again disappear into the Net, but reassures a despondent Batou that whenever he logs in, she will always be beside him.\n\n\n==== Live-action film ====\nIn the 2017 DreamWorks Pictures Ghost in the Shell live-action movie directed by Rupert Sanders, Scarlett Johansson portrays Motoko, who is initially introduced as Mira Killian (who shares the same initials). It is revealed at the end of the film that she was originally a teenage Japanese girl and activist named Motoko Kusanagi (portrayed by Kaori Yamamoto) who had run away from home one year prior to the events of the film. While living with other critics of cyborg technology in what is referred to as the Lawless Region, she is kidnapped by agents of the Hanka Robotics corporation, who perform experiments upon her and place her brain inside a cybernetic body. In effect, this makes her the first full-body cyborg to be successfully developed. Upon awakening inside her new body, Kusanagi is told that her name is Mira Killian and that her family was killed in a terrorist attack. She is also given false memories and subsequently employed by Section 9. Mira later discovers the secret behind her creation from the film's initial antagonist Kuze, who also underwent experimentation, as well as Dr. Ouelet, who played a primary role in developing her prosthetic body. With the help of Section 9, she consents to having Cutter, the Hanka executive trying to murder her, killed by her boss, Aramaki.\n\n\n=== In television ===\n\n\n==== Stand Alone Complex ====\n\nThe Major retains much of her personality from the manga in the anime series Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex and its followup Ghost in the Shell: S.A.C. 2nd GIG, although she is not disrespectful toward the Chief like she is in the manga. As in the manga and unlike the movies, where she had black hair and blue-grey eyes, she now has blue-purple hair and red-violet eyes. Throughout the series, The Major maintains her signature commanding presence and authority. Among the various members of Section 9, Kusanagi is usually the one Chief Aramaki singles out to accompany him on official and off the record business. Kusanagi's personal life is not shown much in the first season. She underwent cyberization at a very early age and had trouble adapting to the use of her body which resulted in her inadvertently breaking one of her favorite dolls. She keeps a wrist watch as proof of her past.\nIn the first season, Kusanagi started questioning the use of the Tachikoma sentient tanks, due to them showing signs of individuality and curiosity not suited for combat. Ultimately, she decides to have them stripped of their weaponry and sent back to the lab that manufactured them for analysis and further work. When the Tachikoma sacrificed themselves to save Batou, Major Kusanagi understands that she was wrong in halting the usage of the Tachikoma and proposes that they might have evolved to have ghosts themselves.\nIn the second season her past was revealed. She was once a little girl who had been in a plane crash causing her to be in a coma. A boy who was also a victim of the plane crash continuously made origami cranes using only his left hand, as much of his body was paralyzed in the accident, in hopes of giving them to her when she woke up. Motoko was eventually taken away when medical complications occurred. The boy thought she had died, but she was actually being cyberized and given a full prosthetic body. When she returned to see the boy, the boy did not recognize her and ignored her. When she left the hospital, the boy realized she was the girl in the coma and made a decision to get cyberized and look for her, but he never saw her again. Throughout the second season, the Major and Section 9 go against a terrorist group called \"The Individual Eleven\". Believing it to be another stand alone complex they unwillingly teamed up with Kazundo Gouda in order to figure out their motive. When the 11 leaders of the individual eleven reveal themselves, they all kill each other except for Hideo Kuze. It was later revealed that Hideo Kuze was the little boy who Motoko once knew as a child; this discovery caused her some emotional confusion.\nIn the Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex: Solid State Society OVA, the Major has left Section 9 for two years and does not appear much in the first half of the film. She first appears on a building jumping off into the darkness. She shows up later as Chroma, to warn Batou to stay away from the \"Solid State Society\". She returns to her normal body after \"Chroma\" re-stores herself in the recharging chamber. She is suspected of being the Puppeteer, but is no longer suspected when she rescues Togusa from a (coerced) suicide attempt. She leads Section 9 on a raid to find the Puppeteer. At the end of Solid State Society, she repeats her famous line, \"The net is truly vast and infinite.\"\n\n\n==== Arise ====\nIn the Ghost in the Shell: Arise (2013) OVA series, Motoko is completely redesigned from her previous incarnations, as are all members of the main character cast. Her cybernetic body is shown as far younger in appearance and shorter in height to other versions, resembling a teenager or young adult and not much taller than Chief Aramaki. Her hair is blue and cut in a close, straight bang form, and she is usually shown wearing full red leather pants and jackets and high heel boots.\n\n\n==== Ghost in the Shell: SAC 2045 ====\nThe Major appears in a CGI Japanese/American animated series SAC 2045, released in 2020. This series is set after previous events, and sees Public Section 9 hire themselves out as mercenaries.\n\n\n=== In video games ===\n\nMotoko is a player character in Ghost in the Shell (1997) for the PlayStation, Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex (2004) for the PlayStation 2, Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex (2005) for the PlayStation Portable, and Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex - First Assault Online (2016) for Microsoft Windows.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nMotoko Kusanagi was well received by media. Motoko ranked 13th in IGN's list of the top anime characters of all time in 2009, commenting that \"though she may be cool, professional, and mostly artificial, she's unquestionably human, and following her adventures through Ghost in the Shell was never less than fascinating\". In 2014, IGN ranked her as the 11th greatest anime character of all time, saying that \"Motoko was a stunning example of a strong female character that didn't need to have her feminism make a statement.\" Motoko's female identity and appearance is countered by the autonomous subjectivity, resulting in a \"male\" cyborg body which cannot menstruate. The original film depicts Motoko's identity and ontological concerns with the evolution of a being, resulting in full subjectivity, through a new form of reproduction with the Puppet Master. Austin Corbett commented on the lack of sexualization from her team as freedom from femininity, noting that Motoko is \"overtly feminine, and clearly non-female\".\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nChipman, Jay Scott (2010). \"So Where Do I Go from Here?

The book series itself is an expansion, with some changes to detail, of Card's 1977 short story \"Ender's Game.\"In the 2013 film adaptation of Ender's Game, Ender is portrayed by Asa Butterfield.\n\n\n== Ender's Game ==\nIn the first book of the series, Ender's Game, Ender is the youngest and most well rounded of three children; his parents received permission to have a third child, which is rare in the state's strict two-child policy. His existence was called for by a program aiming at producing commanders for humanity's war against the Formics, or \"Buggers.\" He attends Battle School, an Earth-orbiting space station that trains similar prodigies. He receives the same education as other children, but the military recognizes him as their best bet to be supreme commander and often manipulates its own rules to make sure Ender has the necessary technical skills and the right character for their ends. Expressly, Ender is conditioned to be entirely self-sufficient from a very young age.\nAs a child, Ender is bullied at school for being a \"Third,\" particularly by a bully named Stilson. After Stilson engages him in a fight, Ender beats him up so severely that the boy is hospitalized and subsequently dies, although Ender is not aware of this fact until much later. Ender is tormented by his brother Peter, a sadist who delights in killing small animals and tormenting other children, and who resents the attention Ender gets from the military. His only refuge is with his beloved sister Valentine, his protector, and only friend. When he is accepted into Battle School, he is brokenhearted at leaving her, but she assures him that they will always have a bond.\nAt Battle School, Ender is exposed to significant emotional and mental anguish and even physical danger. The administration is forbidden from protecting him from harm, guaranteeing that he would never look to anybody else for help.\nEnder breezes through academics, his main interest being the centerpiece of the school: a team-based three-dimensional laser tag competition in the zero-g Battle Room. He becomes a masterful player, then a masterful strategist, and is eventually assigned command of Dragon Army. He molds the group of untested and unwanted students into the most successful army in the history of the school (it is revealed in Ender's Shadow that Julian \"Bean\" Delphiki chose them).\nEnder's unprecedented success arouses his fellow commanders' jealousy, who subject him to steadily worse torment. The lead bully, Bonzo, confronts Ender in the shower and attempts to kill Ender, but fails. Ender, driven to defend himself because of the administration's lack of intervention, kills Bonzo to end the conflict but does not know it. This reinforces Ender's recurring role as the ender of conflict, a personality trait favored by the administration. After the fight, they let Ender graduate from Battle School, never informing him that Bonzo died from his injuries.\nAfter graduating several years ahead of schedule, he is transferred to Command School on Eros. There he trains in interstellar fleet combat with holographic simulators. After Ender masters the game under ordinary conditions, the game changes from one with direct control of ships to one where he relays commands to his friends and associates from Battle School: Julian \"Bean\" Delphiki, Alai, Shen, Petra Arkanian, Dink Meeker, Crazy Tom, Hot Soup, Fly Molo, Vlad, Dumper, and Carn Carby. Under the tutelage of Mazer Rackham, the legendary savior of humanity from the previous war, Ender and his trusted companions take on a grueling series of battles and emerge victorious each time, although the mounting pressure pushes Ender to the edge.\nThe final battle takes place above a planet made by the simulator at command school. The fight is against an enemy with overwhelming numerical superiority. Ender perceives this as a grossly unfair test and resolves to win by breaking the rules. This, he thinks, would convince his instructors that he is not the man to lead the Fleet into battle with the Formics. Instead of fighting the enemy ship-to-ship, Ender penetrates their defensive perimeter and destroys the planet itself. Not until after the pandemonium that follows is he told that it was not a simulation: Instead of taking on Rackham in what they had thought was a long series of simulations, he and his classmates had been unknowingly issuing orders to real ships in real combat. The final battle consisted of the destruction of the Bugger homeworld and the apparent eradication of the Bugger species. Ender is hailed as a hero, but he is stricken with guilt for having unknowingly committed genocide.\nValentine informs him that in the wake of the war, he would never be allowed to return to Earth due to her actions to protect him from Peter, who was becoming a major political force on Earth. He journeys with her to one of the colonies being established on the now-abandoned Bugger worlds. Once there, he discovers a fertilized pupa of a Queen Bugger, hidden in a place that the Buggers designed for him to discover by modeling it to resemble part of an interactive computer game he played during his years in the Battle School. The buggers find out about it during his tormented dreams of them in Command School. The pupal Queen is capable of continuing the Bugger race. Through rudimentary telepathic communication with the Queen, he learned what he had begun to suspect before the war's end: The entire conflict had been a mistake, resulting in the inability of two alien species to communicate. He also learns from the Queen that the Buggers had regretted having mistakenly fought humans and forgiven Ender for destroying their world. Empathizing with the Queen, Ender promises to find her a home to grow where the humans would not annihilate the Buggers.\nTo foster this eventual rebirth, Ender writes a book called The Hive Queen, which tells the story of the war from the Formic perspective. Ender uses the pseudonym Speaker for the Dead to author it. When Peter, who has advanced to the position of Hegemon of Earth, contacts him, the Speaker for the Dead, he writes a second novel, The Hegemon, a human parallel to the first book. The two are combined by popular culture, eventually becoming one of the founding texts of a quasi-religious practice on Earth's colonies. After writing the book, Ender and Valentine depart in a ship in an attempt to find a planet that would allow the Queen to grow and call their new home.\n\n\n== Speaker for the Dead ==\nSpeaker for the Dead begins 3000 years after the events of Ender's Game and the Xenocide. Ender is departing the planet where his sister Valentine has found a husband. He has also acquired an integrated computer by which he communicates with a powerful artificial intelligence known as Jane. Her existence is known only to Ender. He has taken the role of a Speaker for the Dead, keeping his identity as \"Ender the Xenocide\", who orchestrated the victory over the Formics, a secret. His books, \"The Hive Queen\" and \"The Hegemon\", in which he \"spoke\" for the dead Formics, was a self-critical work that was intended to portray Ender as a heartless monster who destroyed a sentient race. The name \"Ender\" is now considered a vile insult. \nEnder departs for the planet Lusitania, where a request has been made to \"speak\" on behalf of a researcher who has died from contact with the planet's indigenous species, the piggies. When he arrives at the planet 22 years later (relativity having aged him only slightly; less than two weeks) he finds that the original call for a Speaker has been rescinded. Two other requests, however, have been made to \"speak\" for more recent deaths. Ender discovers that both calls originated from the same family; the first from Novinha's daughter Ela requesting someone speak for the death of Novinha's husband Marcos, and the second from her eldest son Miro, who has asked for a speaker for the researcher Libo.\nEnder begins to investigate the Marcos figure and has frequent contact with Novinha's family. His honest and open approach endears him to most of the children as a father figure. He discovers that Marcos was abusive to his wife. With the help of Jane and his connection with the children, he uncovers multiple secrets that have been hidden for years. However, while in dialogue with the Children of the Mind, the planet's religious monastic order, he is annoyed by Jane's semi-sarcastic commentary and turns off his connection to her, something he has never done before. The resulting complete isolation and trauma of Jane is the unforeseen result. Jane, without consulting Ender, sends incriminating reports to the interstellar authorities who order the arrest of Miro and Ouanda, the researchers and lovers who have been investigating the piggies. The colony's charter is cancelled and the colonists are forced to rely on Ender for guidance.\nMeanwhile, Ender has been receiving pressure from the Hive-Queen's pupa to allow her to settle on this world because she has been in telepathic contact with another race. Ender assumes this race is the piggies, although the bipedal life forms that are the primary contacts of Miro and Ouanda seem very simple and not telepathic at all. After the sanctions are put in place, he gets Miro and Ouanda to allow him to visit the piggies, who have been asking to meet him, the 'original Speaker' (a claim Miro and Ouanda have been dismissing as a misunderstanding). Ender reverts many of the researchers' assumptions when he not only admits to being the original Speaker, but has the piggies demonstrate that the trees the piggies grow from the corpses of those who have been ritually killed is the third, reproductive stage. The ritual killings of the two xenologers were misunderstandings. The piggies were under the false impression that humans reproduced in a fashion similar to themselves.\nAfter these revelations, Ender proceeds to \"speak\" for Marcos and revealed many secrets hitherto hidden, mostly by Novinha. Foremost among them was that Marcos was incapable of having children, and Novinha's children are offspring of Libo. This is devastating news to Miro, because it means his girlfriend Ouanda is his half-sister. Sanctions from the Intergalactic Congress are learned of and Ender recommends that the colony declare itself in rebellion. He re-establishes contact with Jane who masks their ansible signal.\nHe enters into the beginnings of a relationship with Novinha. His sister, Valentine, agrees to travel to the colony. On the far side of the planet he has discovered a site reminiscent of a dream in Enders Game. With her guidance, he plants the Hive-Queen's pupa in preparation for the rebirth of the Formics after 3000 years.\n\n\n== Xenocide ==\nDuring Xenocide, Ender is looked to as an unofficial leader for the multiple efforts being undertaken in the rebel Colony of Lusitania. He is helping as much as he can with Novinha's work in protecting humans from the descolada virus. The Descolada is fatal to humans, but is essential for the piggies' life and reproduction. The Formics have an immune system that is advanced enough to protect them, and the humans have been using anti-viral dietary supplements, but both defenses are starting to fade in effectiveness in the face of the virus' rampant mutations. Ender is also attempting to keep the peace on planet among the three species where resentment is brewing. The humans are starting to resent the piggies for being the reason they can't just kill the descolada outright. The existence of the new Formic colony is not general knowledge, but Ender knows that their appearance and their non-human way of reasoning would cause friction with the humans. Particularly troublesome are Novinha's two youngest children; Grego, who is something of a rabble-rouser among the humans, and Quara, who sees the virus as sentient and is bringing up problematic objections to the research her mother and sister are doing. The piggies and the Formics are also worried about the approaching human fleet, which may destroy the planet if the threat of the descolada virus is unleashed on humanity.\nEventually, research ordered by the government on another planet, Path, leads a young genius girl, Han Qing-jao, to deduce the existence of Jane, who is inextricably tied to the ansible system. Jane reveals herself to Qing-jao in an effort to prevent her from informing the authorities by telling her that the OCD her people suffer from was governmentally ordered and orchestrated, a plea which the girl's father Han Fei-tzu and handmaiden Si Wang-mu agree with. However, the report to the authorities is dispatched regardless and the government enacts a plan to temporarily deactivate the ansible network to purge Jane from the system. \nThe father agrees to help with the Descolada problem regardless of his daughter's actions, in exchange for a cure for the pervasive OCD that plagues them. The Lusitanian researchers agree, but though a cure for both is designed, it proves impossible to synthesize; they can't cure the OCD without removing the genius as well, and the counter for the descolada simply won't be created. Meanwhile, putting together facts about Jane's origins, the ansible, and philotes, the irreducible building blocks of all matter everywhere, they deduce that Jane has the power to take any object she knows about in great detail and pull it outside the known universe, an area where conscious thought has physical power.\nEnder goes on the first test flight because Jane's existence was a direct result of his time at the Battle School, where the buggers established a connection with him via a computer simulation game; therefore, Jane is most likely to be able to keep Ender's form in her mind. Since Ender has all but passed Jane off to Miro at this point, due to the previous misunderstanding in Speaker, he must go as well. Ela goes because she is the only one with enough knowledge to produce the needed viruses. The test flight occurs with unexpected side-effects. Ela produces the new viruses, but Miro also gives himself a new body, undamaged unlike his old one. Ender, however, inadvertently creates copies of his brother and sister from his memories. They are more based on those memories than reality; therefore, Valentine is very soft and loving, and Peter is almost pure evil and malice. Horrified at what he has created, Ender removes himself from further efforts, as they will all need to involve the instantaneous travel Jane can do by moving things outside and Ender will not risk creating more things like his pseudo-siblings.\n\n\n== Children of the Mind ==\nChildren of the Mind begins where Xenocide left off. Much of Ender's story revolves around his \"pseudo-offspring\" Peter and young Val. After Ender's first and only trip to the outside and back inside, Ender creates Peter and young Val from his aiua. Ender's \"life force\" is now split between three different people. Throughout the book Ender has a difficult time maintaining an aiua strong enough for all three people to live. The maximum number of people Ender can keep alive and healthy at any given time is two. In the beginning young Val suffers the most because Ender is the least interested in her mission, until it is revealed that she, along with Miro and Jane, are looking for the home planet of the descolada virus. Peter never had to compete for Ender's aiua because Ender was always interested in Peter's mission to prevent the Lusitania fleet from using the Molecular Disruption Device on Lusitania. Now that Ender's aiua is fully invested in Peter and young Val, Ender himself begins to deteriorate. This causes Ender to collapse while working in the monastery garden, falling in and out of consciousness for the remainder of the book until his death. Ender's physical manifestation is gone, but his aiua continues through Peter (young Val gives up her physical manifestation as well for Jane and her aiua continues through Peter as well).\n\n\n== Ender in Exile ==\nA book that chronicles the 'lost years' between Ender's Game and Speaker for the Dead, Ender in Exile tells of Ender's initial set-off from Eros, the long journey to the first colony, Shakespeare, as well as his trip to the Indian-dominant colony of Ganges, where Ender encounters a familiar, yet not-so-familiar face. The court martial of Hyrum Graff is expanded upon; some light is shed on Graff's life after he was made Minister of Colonization, as well as Mazer Rackham's travels after the Formic War.\nAfter defeating the Formics, Ender remains on Eros. Peter, under his alias of Locke, has quelled the warring nations and has implemented a temporary truce. Valentine no longer wishes to be a part of Peter's quest to rule the world. She pleads with her parents to come along with her and Ender to the planet colony of Shakespeare. They decline.  Alessandra and her mother, Dorabella, sign-up to go to Shakespeare to get away from Dorabella's mother and money problems. They had planned to be put into stasis during the two-year voyage, but several complications occurred and instead they remain awake. Along with the crew of Ender, Valentine, Admiral Quincy Morgan (the captain) and some other colonists who opted against stasis.\nThroughout the voyage, Ender has a battle of wills with Admiral Morgan, who attempts to usurp Ender's lawful position as Governor of Shakespeare. Morgan sees Ender to be a foolish child that no one would follow. During the voyage, Dorabella seduces Admiral Morgan and tries to use her daughter, Alessandra, to seduce Ender hoping that, through her own marriage to Morgan and Alessandras' successful marrying of Ender, Morgan could rule Shakespeare using Ender as a puppet.\nUpon arrival at Shakespeare, Ender quickly and easily crushes Morgan's attempted bloodless coup, with a little help from Minister of Colonization Hyrum Graff back on Earth. Ender then successfully liberates Alessandra from her dominating mother. After two years as governor, and completing 'The Hive Queen and the Hegemon', Ender convinces Valentine to move on.\nEnder's first stop, at the request of Hyrum Graff, is the Hindu colony of Ganges which is governed by Virlomi, a former battle school student who caused an uprising in India before she was subdued and exiled by Peter Wiggin's Hegemony. Once there, Ender agrees to help Virlomi quell an uprising by a group called 'The Natives of Ganges', led by an angry young man named Randall Firth under the delusion that he is the son of Achilles de Flandres. The so-called 'natives' have adopted 'The Hive Queen' as a rallying cry, and have begun to belittle the name of war hero Ender Wiggin coining the phrase 'Ender the Xenocide'.\nEnder and Randall have a physical combat leaving Ender near death. Ender reveals Randall's true parentage (two of Ender's old friends and squadron commanders, Julian 'Bean' Delphiki and Petra Arkanian Delphiki Wiggin), after which Randall renounces his secret name, Achilles, and renames himself Arkanian Delphiki.

She is a student of Riverdale High School, sometimes known to her schoolmates by the nickname Big Ethel, though this nickname has largely fallen out of use since the 1980s.\nShe was first drawn by cartoonist Samm Schwartz, probably modeled after a prototype designed by Bill Vigoda for a 1948 Archie Comics story. She has been voiced by Jane Webb, Jazzmin Lausanne, and Michele Phillips. Cindy Ambuehl played Ethel in the television film Archie: To Riverdale and Back Again, and Shannon Purser portrays the character in a recurring capacity on The CW's Riverdale.\n\n\n== History and character ==\nEthel Muggs (originally Ethel Dinklehof) was portrayed in the early era as a tall, gangly, plain-faced, somewhat boy-crazy young woman that had a huge infatuation with Jughead Jones. This was explained in her first appearance in Archie's Pal, Jughead #84 as the result of Dilton Doiley's \"Electronic Mate Selector\" selecting Jughead as \"the perfect mate\" for her. She usually resorted to devious means to get Jughead in her clutches, and would typically end up running after him. Ethel has also pursued Jughead by appealing to his appetite; the Betty and Veronica comic title often featured real recipes that Ethel used to make her way to Jughead's heart through his stomach. Earlier issues featuring Big Ethel show her bearing a strong resemblance to Jughead, also, with her prominent nose, dark hair, and angular build. In the late 1980s, Ethel was occasionally drawn with braces on her buck teeth.\nAlthough Ethel is usually portrayed as drab-looking and gawky, one story involving a makeover by Betty Cooper and Veronica Lodge in an attempt to attract Jughead's attention revealed her to be quite curvy and pretty (albeit still with buck teeth).  Despite her new look, Jughead was as uninterested as ever.\nIn the later era, she has been portrayed as an average, decent-looking, somewhat likeable teen girl, whose infatuation for Jughead has been considerably toned down.  She now has other interests that keep her mind from Jughead, including Dilton and Archie Andrews, to keep her company.  This actually tends to make Jughead a bit jealous. She and Dilton share mutual sympathy due to their few successes with romantic relationships, which is one of the reasons that they occasionally date. She has even been on one memorable date with Archie in one story. That date showed another side of Ethel, where she was funny, smart and attractive. The same story also introduces Hank, a friend of Ethel's who works at a local club Archie and Ethel visit on their date. It is later revealed that Hank was originally a pen pal of Ethel's, and she sent him a picture of Veronica instead of herself because of her low self-esteem. When Hank met Veronica standing in as Ethel, he dumped her because of her vanity. He soon ran into the real Ethel, and told her she was the most exciting girl he has ever met, and that Veronica could not hold a candle to her. When she questions his sincerity, he replies that he does mean it, and she is even more beautiful than Veronica. In another story, a merman (temporarily transformed into a teenage human boy) finds her enchanting due to her inner beauty, giving her self-esteem a huge boost.\nAlthough Jughead drives Ethel away when her affections are too obvious, he can often stand being around her when she keeps her calm. In a storyline that ran in Jughead in the early 1990s, Ethel told Jughead she is tired of chasing him, and begins a romantic relationship with Jeffrey, a blind boy. During this time, Jughead also had a semi-romantic relationship with Anita, a paraplegic African-American teen. Both Jughead and Ethel displayed jealousy at the others' relationship, but the storyline was eventually dropped.Various stories depict Ethel as a fan of science fiction, art, and trains. She also has a talent for making doll-house furniture, and often works as a babysitter. She is also a fine cook, which is one of the reasons Jughead occasionally submits to being around her. She is fond of dogs, and sometimes uses her attractive female poodle, Clementine, as bait to lure Jughead and Hot Dog.\n\n\n== Other versions ==\n\n\n=== Afterlife with Archie ===\nIn the second issue of the 2013 Archie Horror series Afterlife with Archie, Ethel attends the Halloween dance dressed as Snow White and after an attempted flirtation, a zombified Jughead bites and infects her. When the reanimated Ethel goes after Betty, Veronica blasts and hits the zombie with a fire extinguisher. When she doesn't stay down, the kids realize that a zombie apocalypse is upon them.\n\n\n=== Archie's R/C Racers ===\nIn the Archie's R/C Racers series (which takes place outside the regular Archie continuity), Ethel was a member of Archie's team who was traveling across the United States racing radio-controlled cars. She was given her own subplot in the series when she chose to leave Archie's team and join Babette and her henchmen, one of whom had a crush on Ethel and whose feelings were returned. They promised to help Ethel's aspiring country music career. Gradually, she became a starlet, known as \"Ethel Sue\".\nEthel eventually learned the truth about the trio when Babette convinced her to pose for some publicity photos.  Standing in front of a large metal target, Ethel suddenly became strapped to the target and Babette prepared to shoot her with a ray gun, which Ethel believed was a camera. Babette explained that the ray gun was a device that can give the recipient mental powers and she planned on using it on herself after testing it on Ethel. Before she could be zapped, Archie's team saved her. Babette instead zapped a tour guide, who became a villain in the series. Ethel left Babette and returned to Archie's team.\n\n\n=== Life with Archie: The Married Life ===\nEthel Muggs appears in Life with Archie: The Married Life.\n\n\n=== Prototypes ===\nAn early unnamed prototype for the Big Ethel character drawn by Bill Vigoda appeared in Archie Comics #30 (1948). In the story \"Patch as Catch Can\", Riverdale had a \"patch hop\"; the girl who could sew her patch on a boy's clothes is his date for the dance. Archie was trying to avoid Betty. While running from her, he found a boy on a tandem, and jumps aboard. He soon realized the boy was actually a very unattractive girl, whom Archie referred to as a \"Zombie\". Except for her freckles she looks exactly like Ethel with black hair in pigtails, a buck toothed smile, and a tall skinny figure. Archie jumped off the bike, and continued to dodge Betty throughout the story. In the end, he ended up strung from rope tied to a flagpole, and the \"Zombie\" returned and sewed a patch on Archie's underwear. The story ended with Archie lying on the railroad tracks, saying \"It's no use, Jug. This is a much easier way out.\"\nThere was also a later character similar to Ethel named Ophelia Glutenschnable. Ophelia was also tall, skinny and dark, but her hair was styled differently, her nose was much bigger, and she usually had no buck teeth. She relentlessly pursued Jughead and all the other boys. In contrast to later stories, Jughead willingly went on dates with Ophelia. In one gag, Archie asks Jughead why he asked Ophelia to the dance, and Jughead replies that she was different: \"She's the only one who'll go with me!\" Eventually, Ophelia was replaced by Big Ethel.A separate and unrelated character named \"Big Ethel\" appeared in Archie's Girls Betty and Veronica #95 (November 1963). This character is a plump, disheveled redhead who chased Jughead. Betty and Veronica gave her a makeover (secured by waist-slimming shapewear) that turned her into a voluptuous beauty; however, her makeover was undone after a sneeze caused the foundation garment to break and her hair and clothing to become a mess. In later reprint stories, the character is renamed \"Esmeralda\".\n\n\n== Titles ==\nEthel has never had her own series, but has been a supporting character mainly in the various Jughead series, as well as some of the Betty series, as she has a close friendship with Betty Cooper. She also has solo stories in the various Archie anthology titles. In 1982, she co-starred in the Spire Christian Comics title Archie and Big Ethel.In October 2021, a series created by Keryl Brown Ahmed and Siobhan was published on Webtoon under the name Archie Comics: Big Ethel Energy, in which Ethel is the main character of a future Riverdale where everyone has graduated since long.\n\n\n== In other media ==\n\n\n=== Television ===\n\n\n==== Animated ====\nEthel made her television debut in the early Filmation Archie cartoons, most notably in the \"How to Catch a Man\" segments on Archie's Funhouse, where she is voiced by Jane Webb. Webb went on to voice the character, among several others, in numerous Archie-based television projects from 1968 to 1977.\nEthel appears in The New Archies, voiced by Jazzmin Lausanne.\nEthel appears sporadically in Archie's Weird Mysteries voiced by Michele Phillips. This incarnation is visually based on older versions of the character, but like in the newer comics, she also has other interests, such as beekeeping and magic.\n\n\n==== Live-action ====\n\nEthel appears in the 1990 television film Archie: To Riverdale and Back Again, where she is portrayed as an adult by Cindy Ambuehl. Ethel is now a gorgeous fashion model, having been a late bloomer, and still has a crush on Jughead Jones. By the end of the movie, Jughead and his son decide to stay in Riverdale so that he can pursue a relationship with Ethel.\nEthel is portrayed by Shannon Purser in The CW television series Riverdale, which debuted in 2017. In the series, Ethel is not shown to be obsessed with Jughead and is actually good friends with his girlfriend, Betty Cooper, and later Veronica Lodge after their shared experiences with harassment by Chuck Clayton. However, in season 3, it is revealed that Ethel is infatuated with Jughead and even convinces him to kiss her while playing a game of Gryphons and Gargoyles.\n\n\n== References ==", "infobox": {"name": "Ethel Muggs", "series": "{{no italic|[[Archie Comics]]}}", "image": "EthelMuggs.jpg", "image_size": "210px", "first": "''[[Jughead (comic book)|Archie's Pal Jughead]]'' #84 (May 1962)", "creator": "[[Samm Schwartz]]", "portrayer": "[[Cindy Ambuehl]] <br /> (''[[Archie: To Riverdale and Back Again]]'')<br />[[Shannon Purser]] <br /> (''[[Riverdale (2017 TV series)|Riverdale]]'')", "voice": "[[Jane Webb]] <br /> (''[[The Archie Show]]'') <br /> Jazzmin Lausanne <br /> (''[[The New Archies]]'') <br /> Michele Phillips <br /> (''[[Archie's Weird Mysteries]]'')", "lbl1": "Hometown", "data1": "[[Riverdale (Archie Comics)|Riverdale]]", "lbl2": "School", "data2": "Riverdale High School"}, "wikidata": {"instance of (P31)": "fictional human (Q15632617)", "sex or gender (P21)": "female (Q6581072)", "occupation (P106)": "cook (Q156839)", "Comic Vine ID (P5905)": "4005-2796", "Europeana entity (P7704)": "agent/base/147852", "performer (P175)": "Cindy Ambuehl (Q11831961)", "creator (P170)": "Samm Schwartz (Q7409629)", "Freebase ID (P646)": "/m/01djdk"}, "cat": "Comics_characters", "url": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethel_Muggs"}, {"name": "Mapui Kawlim", "url_name": "48483748", "txt": "Mapui Kawlim (alias Wingstar) is a superhero appearing in the Indian comic book Tinkle. It was created by Sean D\u2032mello and Artist Vineet Nair. It made a debut on the 35th anniversary issue of the comic book, issue number 639 released in November 2015. It is the first superhero from Mizoram. The name \"Mapui\" is a popular pet name among the Mizo people. The character originates from Aizawl, the capital city of Mizoram. She is the first female superhero from northeast India in the series of Tinkle. The editor Rajani Thindiath described it as a \"reluctant superhero\" but \"has the potential to be the most iconic female superhero characters in Indian comic history.\" She acquires super flight and super strength from gadgets developed by her inventor-father.\n\n\n== Character ==\nMapui is a 13-year-old girl from a middle-class family living in Aizawl. She is a naturally reluctant girl and preferring to play cricket than being a superhero. She is a regular school girl, but would try to avoid home works, and particularly averse to doing mathematics. She would rather go for sleepovers. Her father, Tashi Kawlim, is an inventor working for the Space Development Arm of the government. Her gadgets, including a secret superhero boost are developed by her father. She became a superhero after testing the gadget inventions of her father. Her gadgets are rocket thrusters that can make a speed of 110 km per hour, iron fists that can break brick walls, and reinforced robotic arms that can lift a ton of weight. Wearing a white and green suit, she fights criminals at night as her alias Wingstar. The signals of criminal activity are indicated by a special wristwatch, which allows her to receive notification at the same time as the police.\n\n\n== Purpose ==\nThe Tinkle has successful and regular characters such as Shikari Shambhu, Suppandi and Kalia the Crow. But they are becoming old-fashioned strips. It tries to include characters hanging innovative technology. Introduction of two female superheroes, SuperWeirdos and PsyMage, were not a success. The CatchNews reported that one of the objectives of introducing this superhero is to mend the feeling of prejudices among the people in northeast India. There are opinions in the mainland India that northeast India is more closely allied to China than to India. This has resulted in outcries of racial stereotyping and discrimination. The prejudices also turned to occasional violence, and northeasterners are the major victims. There are rape incidences of northeast Indian girls in other parts of India.In a comment, editor Rajni Thindiath added another objective, saying, \"We need more iconic female heroes to join the plethora of enduring male comic characters in the country \u2013 Suppandi, Shikari Shambu and Tantri the Mantri. Over half of the children in our country are female after all.\"\n\n\n== References ==", "infobox": {"character_name": "Mapui", "publisher": "[[ACK Media]]", "debut": "November 2015", "first_comic": "''[[Tinkle]]''", "creators": "Sean D\u2032mello and Vineet Nair", "aliases": "Wingstar", "full_name": "Mapui Kawlim", "powers": "Super flight and super strength"}, "wikidata": {"Google Knowledge Graph ID (P2671)": "/g/11bwn3hjkq"}, "cat": "Comics_characters", "url": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mapui"}, {"name": "Sarah Williams", "url_name": "65467273", "txt": "Sarah Williams is a fictional character and the protagonist of the 1986 fantasy film Labyrinth. Portrayed by Jennifer Connelly, Sarah is an imaginative teenager who wishes for the goblins from her favourite story to take away her baby brother Toby. When her inadvertent wish comes true, she must solve an enormous otherworldly labyrinth in thirteen hours and rescue Toby from the castle of Jareth, the Goblin King.\nCreated by director Jim Henson and writer Dennis Lee, the character was developed by a number of colleagues including screenwriters Laura Phillips and Elaine May as well as executive producer George Lucas. Sarah is Labyrinth's central character, in whose imagination the film's fantasy settings and characters exist, based on the books, posters and toys in her bedroom. Elements of her adventure were inspired by fairy tales and classical stories, as well as fantasy literature such as Alice in Wonderland and The Wizard of Oz.\nReception to the character upon the film's release was mixed, although Sarah has grown in the esteem of critics in recent decades. Reviewers were divided over her initial petulant attitude, with some regarding her as unsympathetic, while others have found her to be an identifiable teenage protagonist because of her flaws. The character's intelligence and perseverance have also received praise. Connelly's role as Sarah brought her international fame and has remained one of the actress's best known performances.\n\n\n== Development ==\n\n\n=== Concept and writing ===\nLabyrinth started as a collaboration between director Jim Henson and conceptual designer Brian Froud following their previous collaboration, The Dark Crystal (1982). In making Labyrinth, Henson wanted to create a film that combined elements of fairy tales and classical stories in a script that would appeal to a modern audience. According to Froud, he and Henson decided to have human characters as the lead roles in order to make Labyrinth \"more accessible and immediate\" than The Dark Crystal, which had featured only puppets. Henson explained that they structured Labyrinth \"in a way that the human is really carrying the whole picture\" and acts as a \"bridge\" between the fantastical puppets and the audience. The protagonist of Labyrinth was, at different stages of its development, going to be a boy, a king whose baby had been put under an enchantment, a princess from a fantasy world, and a young girl from Victorian England. According to Henson, the decision to have the lead character be a girl was made \"because so many adventure films feature boys. We just wanted to even the balance.\" In order to make the film more commercial, they made Sarah a teenager from contemporary 1980s America. Henson stated:\n\n\"We basically wanted to make Labyrinth about the growing-up process of maturity, working with the idea of a young girl right at that point between girl and woman, shedding her childhood thoughts for adult thoughts. Specifically, I wanted to make the idea of taking responsibility for one's life \u2014 which is one of the neat realizations a teenager experiences \u2014 a central thought of the film.\" \nAccording to co-writer Dennis Lee, he and Henson defined two main characteristics for Sarah as being \"spunky, feisty, high-spirited\" and \"very volatile \u2013 poised on the brink of womanhood, and capable of trying out very different versions of whom she might be\". Henson also wanted her to be initially spoiled and petulant in order to allow for her character to grow out of these flaws over the course of the film. Acknowledging that the character cannot experience every aspect of maturity in the course of an evening or an hour-and-a-half movie, Henson said that the film concentrates most of all on Sarah learning to take responsibility for her life as well as for her baby brother she is supervising. According to Henson's eldest daughter Lisa, Sarah's personality was partly modelled on Henson's second-eldest daughter, Cheryl, who had been \"very romantic in her outlook\" and passionate about fantasy and theatre as a teenager. Cheryl, who was a puppeteer on Labyrinth, admitted that she had inspired some aspects of the character, such as Sarah being \"a little selfish, a little too smart for her own good\", and her desire to escape to a strange world. Jim Henson was living with his three daughters while making Labyrinth, all of whom he had witnessed going through the same period of their lives as the teenaged Sarah, which according to Cheryl was significant to \"the level of honesty\" in the character's depiction.Between the more than twenty-five iterations of the Labyrinth screenplay, the character was continually tweaked to create a lead role that audiences would find sympathetic and be able to relate to. Henson hired Fraggle Rock writer Laura Phillips to rewrite primary screenwriter Terry Jones' script, providing more insight into Sarah's inner life and personal interests. To further develop Sarah's character, Henson sought input from executive producer George Lucas, writer Elaine May and numerous colleagues. Lucas advised the structure of Sarah's journey based on his knowledge of mythological motifs and the work of Joseph Campbell. May's contributions \"humaniz[ed] the characters\", and made Sarah \"a more authentic girl\". Early production meetings also gave focus to reflecting Sarah's emotional journey through the film's visuals. Froud had suggested to Henson the idea of a labyrinth as a setting for the film, partly because he recognised it as symbolic of Sarah's mind due to its resemblance to a brain. According to Lee, the use of graphic artist M. C. Escher's work as basis for one of the set designs (the \"Escher\" staircase scene) served to create a scene where Sarah is forcibly detached from her previous taken-for-granted assumptions about the reliability of her own senses and her perception of time and space.The dream world of the Labyrinth created for the film is centered around Sarah, with the influences of the film also being the influences of her mind. Henson stated, \"the world that Sarah enters exists in her imagination. The film starts out in her bedroom and you see all the books she's read growing up \u2013 The Wizard of Oz, Alice in Wonderland, the works of Maurice Sendak. The world she enters shows elements of all these stories that fascinated her as a girl\". Additional titles shown briefly in Sarah's room at the start of the film are Through the Looking-Glass, Grimm's Fairy Tales, a book of Hans Christian Andersen's fairy tales, and Walt Disney's Snow White Annual. The goblins that come to take her brother away, as well as Sarah's monologue that she recites to defeat the Goblin King, are from her favourite story, a play called \"The Labyrinth\" which she rehearses at the beginning of the film. Sarah's experiences in the Labyrinth are also reflective of the objects shown in her room. Many of the characters she encounters bear a resemblance to her toys, including a statuette of the Goblin King. The Labyrinth itself resembles her maze-puzzle board game. The dress Sarah wears in her ballroom dream adorns a miniature doll on her music box, which also plays the same tune as in her dream. One of the obstacles that Jareth sets on Sarah recalls the \"Slashing Machine\" record on her shelf, and Sarah's final confrontation with the king takes place in a room that resembles her poster of Escher's Relativity.Some of Sarah's books and posters were those that had been childhood favourites of Henson's, as well as reflecting his children's interests. Henson said that by \"plant[ing] all those things in Sarah's room as what she would dream about\" they made the film \"a homage to all the things we love.\"\n\n\n=== Casting and filming ===\n\nFor the lead role of Sarah, a progressively maturing character, Henson sought \"a girl who looked and could act that kind of dawn-twilight time between childhood and womanhood.\" 150 girls auditioned for the part in the United Kingdom and the United States, with auditions starting in England in April 1984. A \"dark and cynical\" Helena Bonham Carter read for the role, but was passed over in favor of having Sarah be played by an American actress. Monthly auditions were held in the United States until January 1985. The list of American auditionees included Jane Krakowski, Mary Stuart Masterson, Yasmine Bleeth, Sarah Jessica Parker, Laura San Giacomo, Laura Dern, Ally Sheedy, Maddie Corman, Kerri Green, Lili Taylor, Mia Sara, Marisa Tomei, Molly Ringwald, Trini Alvarado, Tracey Gold, Claudia Wells, Jill Schoelen, and Danielle von Zerneck. Late in the casting process, Krakowski, Sheedy and Corman were considered to be the top candidates. Reading for the part in January 1985, 14-year-old actress Jennifer Connelly \"won Jim [Henson] over\" and he cast her within a week. Recalling Connelly's audition, Henson said, \"She did a terrific line-reading, then an improvisation that sent chills down my back ... she was simply a perfect actress.\" He felt that Connelly was \"exactly right\" for the role as she was \"just at that point in her life that Sarah was in the picture.\" Connelly moved to England in February 1985 in advance of Labyrinth's rehearsals, and spent seven months between March and September 1985 making the film at Thorn-EMI Elstree Studios in London. She expressed that she had \"always been the biggest fan of Sesame Street, so working with Mr. Henson was a dream.\"Sarah was Connelly's fourth film role. Discussing her understanding of the part, Connelly said that Labyrinth is \"about a sort of awakening. . .a young girl growing out of her childhood, who is just now becoming aware of the responsibilities that come with growing up.\" She explained that Sarah learns \"that she can't hold onto her childhood any longer. She has to change, and she must open up to other people and other things.\" Connelly also related the character's development to her own experience of adolescence, saying that while Sarah's change from child to adult is like an \"on-off switch\", for herself \"It's more of a gradual progression. In some ways, I don't want to grow up, but I've always known it was going to happen. I haven't tried to stop it. In that way, Sarah and I are different.\"As Sarah is one of the few human characters in Labyrinth, Connelly initially found it a challenge to interact naturally with the puppets she shared many of her scenes with. Comparing the experience to acting with animals, she found the creatures easy to relate to once she thought of them as characters instead of puppets. She got along well with Henson, who she felt understood her very well and \"was very good at catching what [she] was feeling\" due to him having a daughter the same age as her. Connelly enjoyed making the film, describing the experience as \"joyous\", \"magical\", and the Labyrinth set as being \"like a wonderland\" for her. She found Henson's direction both creative and receptive to her ideas, saying, \"He has a very positive idea of how a scene should be, but if you do something different, he'll say, 'Well, that's not what I had in mind, but I like that, too. Let's go with it.'\" Connelly also enjoyed working alongside her costar David Bowie (Jareth), from whom she learnt \"to try many things ... to have fun with [acting], and to get to the point where you know your scene so well, that when you go to the set, you can just run with it, go in all different directions.\" Connelly completed most of her scenes in two or three takes, except for very technical scenes or those involving complex puppets. Her most difficult stunt was the \"Shaft of Hands\" sequence where she descended a 30-foot high shaft in a body mold attached to a hinged bar, accompanied by a camera mounted on a forty-foot vertical camera track. While Connelly named the ballroom scene as her favourite to film, she said she \"had no skill whatsoever\" at ballroom dancing, and had to have lessons with the scene's choreographer, Cheryl McFadden.\n\n\n=== Costume ===\n\nBrian Froud and costume designer Ellis Flyte fashioned Sarah's main outfit as a waistcoat and large white blouse which \"didn't place her precisely in this world\" but would look appropriate in a fairy tale world. However, they made sure she wore a pair of blue jeans in order to keep her contemporary. Sarah is first introduced in the film wearing a medieval-style gown which is revealed to be a costume when her jeans are shown beneath it.In the scene of Sarah's masquerade ball fantasy, she wears a silver ballgown with puffed sleeves and gold detailing. The costumers wanted the character to look like \"an otherworldly princess\", and designed her outfit with a silver and mint colour scheme to set her apart from the other people in the scene. Sarah's ballgown was made from silver lam\u00e9 and iridescent rainbow paper, overlaid with lace and jewels on the bodice, and worn with a pannier beneath the skirt. According to Flyte, it took much sampling and camera testing to achieve the \"ethereal\" effect of the gown's final design. According to Froud, Henson originally wanted Connelly's hair in ringlets for the scene, which \"horrified\" Froud and to which Connelly's parents disagreed, as they did not want her to appear too grown up. Working with the film's hairdressers, Froud eventually devised an \"art nouveau\" style for Connelly's hair with silver leaves and vines entwined at the sides, \"something that was connected to nature and yet had a sophistication to it.\" Her hair was dressed with jeweled glue particles.Sarah is depicted in her ballgown on the film's promotional poster, designed and painted by Ted CoConis. Henson had insisted that Sarah be portrayed in her blue jeans; however, CoConis overrode this input as he felt it \"inappropriate for the look and feeling of the painting as well as the movie itself. [Sarah] simply had to be wearing the gorgeous gown\".\n\n\n== In Labyrinth ==\n\n16-year-old Sarah Williams rehearses a play called \"The Labyrinth\" in the park with her dog Merlin but becomes distracted by a line she is unable to remember. Realizing she is late to babysit her baby half-brother Toby, she rushes home and is confronted by her stepmother before she and Sarah's father go out. Sarah then finds Toby in possession of her treasured childhood teddy bear, Lancelot. Frustrated by this and his constant crying, Sarah rashly wishes Toby be taken away by the goblins. She is shocked when Toby disappears and Jareth, the Goblin King, arrives. He offers Sarah her dreams within a crystal ball in exchange for the baby. Not having truly meant her wish, Sarah declines and insists on getting Toby back. Jareth then informs Sarah that Toby is in his castle at the centre of the Labyrinth, and that to retrieve the baby she must solve the maze in thirteen hours or Toby will remain in the goblin realm forever.\nSarah meets a cantankerous dwarf named Hoggle who shows her the entrance to the Labyrinth. She has trouble finding her way at first, but meets a talking worm who inadvertently sends her in the wrong direction. Entering a stone maze, Sarah uses her tube of lipstick to mark dead ends, only to find the stones she marked have been flipped. After encountering a double-doorway guarded by four guards and solving their logic puzzle, Sarah falls into a pit of talking hands and ends up in an oubliette, where she reunites with Hoggle. She bargains with him to lead her further into the Labyrinth in exchange for her bracelet. They pass through a tunnel of false alarms before being confronted by Jareth. Sarah boasts to Jareth that solving the Labyrinth is easy, and he sends a goblin-driven steel machine to chase her and Hoggle out of the tunnel. Hoggle reneges on his bargain with Sarah, and she steals his jewelry collection. \nAfter encountering a strange old man with a talking bird for a hat, Sarah saves a gentle beast named Ludo from torture by some goblin soldiers. After passing a pair of talking door knockers and entering a forest, Sarah is ambushed by a group of wild creatures called the Fireys, who attempt to remove her head. Hoggle helps her to escape, and they both almost fall into the Bog of Eternal Stench but are saved by Ludo. They meet Sir Didymus, who guards the bridge over the Bog. The bridge collapses beneath Sarah but she is saved from falling into the bog when Ludo calls up rocks for her to walk on.\nHoggle, under Jareth's orders, gives Sarah an enchanted peach which makes her forget about her quest. Drawn towards some dream crystals sent by Jareth, Sarah is transported into a dream of a masquerade ball. She finds Jareth and they dance, until she rebuffs him and escapes the dream. Falling into a junkyard, she is distracted by an old Junk Lady who offers Sarah her various childhood items. Sarah's memory returns when she finds her book \"The Labyrinth\" and, realising that her belongings are all junk, she resumes her quest to save Toby, reuniting with her friends at the gate to the Goblin City.\nAfter overcoming first the gate guard then the goblin army, Sarah arrives at Jareth's castle, whereupon she parts from her friends, insisting she must face Jareth alone and promising to call the others if needed. In a gravity-defying room of staircases, Sarah confronts Jareth while trying to retrieve Toby. As Jareth offers Sarah her dreams again, promising to be her slave on the condition that she fear, love and obey him, she remembers the line from her book: \"You have no power over me!\". She is returned home safely with Toby.\nRealizing how important Toby is to her, Sarah gives him Lancelot. She sees Hoggle, Ludo and Didymus in her bedroom mirror and admits that even though she is growing up, she still needs them in her life every now and again. Her friends and a number of other characters from the Labyrinth appear in her room to celebrate with her.\n\n\n== Characterisation and themes ==\n\n\n=== Family and responsibility ===\n16 years old, Sarah is at the start of the film a discontent teenager who resents the babysitting responsibility that her father and stepmother expect her to take for her baby half-brother, Toby. Adam Trainer of Senses of Cinema wrote that the introduction of the stepmother suggests Sarah is a child of divorce, as were increasing numbers of children in the 1980s. Playbills and various news clippings in Sarah's room reveal that her absent mother Linda Williams is a stage actress, though it is unknown to what extent Linda is absent from Sarah's life. Connelly said that Sarah is at the start of the film \"a bit closed off\" due to her parents' separation and has \"made her own little world where she's looking back and clinging on to memories, and doesn't really want to accept the fact that things change and [aren't] going to be the way she wants forever.\" A \"bookworm\", Sarah has a preoccupation with drama and romantic fairy tales, and is apt to playing pretend, using fantasy stories as a mental escape from her unhappy home life. Kelcie Mattson of Bitch Flicks wrote that while the character \"boasts a full, varied emotional life\" over the course of the film, initially she embodies several negative stereotypes of teenage girls, such as being immature, petulant, selfish and jealous. Describing Sarah as someone \"resisting growing up, clinging to her childhood,\" Henson said the character starts out as an \"overspoiled brat\" who neglects her brother and refuses to take responsibility for her life; this is encapsulated in the character's favourite expression, \"It's not fair!\". Mattson observed that Sarah's \"defense mechanism against her growing responsibilities is to cast herself into a skewed fantasy\" in which she is victimised by her parents. Rene Jordan of El Miami Herald identified Sarah as having \"a Cinderella complex\", believing that her stepmother mistreats her by assuming she'll look after Toby occasionally. Essayist Tom Holste wrote that it is \"a clever twist on traditional fairy tales\" that Sarah's stepmother is \"the nice one\", while Sarah herself \u2013 \"the \"princess\"\" \u2013 is \"insufferable\". Chris Cabin of Collider wrote that the rift between Sarah and her stepmother spurs the film's \"anti-authoritarian mood\".Rita Kempley of The Washington Post identified Sarah as \"the ing\u00e9nue, a resourceful young woman with a wonderful imagination, great courage and a healthy case of sibling rivalry\". Sarah's animosity towards her brother turns into undying love when she is faced with the responsibility of rescuing him, wrote Today. Consequence wrote that Sarah redeems herself early on in the film when she turns down Jareth's offer of her dreams and resolves to save her brother. Her redemption arc further develops throughout the film; while in the Labyrinth, Sarah exhibits qualities such as compassion, quick-thinking and resoluteness, is \"willing to trust others and open to evolution of thought,\" and overcomes her \"pre-judgment, naivety, and her fear of the unknown\". Sarah matures over her adventure, gradually freeing herself from childish impulses, becoming less selfish, and learning to take responsibility for her actions. Casey Reiland of Duquesne University wrote that Sarah is \"a character who truly depicts the struggle girls are faced with as they grow up\" of learning to balance her fantasies with her real life responsibilities.\n\n\n=== Coming of age and personal agency ===\nCritics understand the subtext of Labyrinth as Sarah's journey to womanhood, including her sexual awakening represented by the Goblin King. Several commentators have noted the parallel between Sarah's relationship to Jareth and that of Sarah's actress mother to her co-star boyfriend (also depicted as Bowie), James Gracey observing, \"Sarah finds that she too is tempted to make the same choice [as her mother] and abandon her family for a fantastical romance\". Although Sarah initially desires freedom from her babysitting responsibilities, she comes to realise what Jareth offers her \"isn't power and freedom, but isolation and selfishness,\" penned Anne Perry of Hodderscape. Gwynne Watkins of Yahoo! wrote that Sarah realises escaping into a fantasy would mean ceding control over her own life. Sophie Mayer and Charlotte Richardson Andrews in The Guardian noted that despite the Hebrew meaning of Sarah's name being \"princess\", Sarah rejects her fantasy of being a princess in the scene when she bursts the bubble of her ballroom dream. Identifying Sarah's abandonment of her princess fantasies, and refusal to be treated as one, as the central theme of Labyrinth, Tor.com's Bridget McGovern wrote that the film \"systematically reject[s] the usual \u201cprincess\u201d trope\" through Sarah's refusal to find her \"happy ending...on the arm of\" King Jareth. Critics commonly contrast Sarah's decision and that of the young heroines in traditional fairy tales, such as \"Cinderella\", \"Snow White\" and \"Sleeping Beauty\", who ultimately marry a royal suitor. Like them, Sarah is offered marriage and a kingdom and the chance to \"go right from parents to husband, escaping a wicked stepmother by running to the arms of a wealthy suitor,\" wrote L. S. Kilroy of online magazine Minerva; however, Sarah instead chooses \"herself. To loosen her grip on childhood ... but not to rush into adulthood before she's ready\". Cat Lafuente of TheList.com wrote that although Jareth's offer would have made her a queen, Sarah rejects it \"because she doesn't need his power, as she already has an immense amount of her own\". Writing for Culteress, Kristen Lopez identified Sarah as a feminist character who \"understands [Jareth's] manipulative and controlling ways\" and \"ultimately learns being under a man's thumb is no way to live\", making Labyrinth a \"refreshing ... story that tells girls they should be their own ruler.\"Rookie and HelloGiggles noted Sarah as a rare example of a female lead in a fantasy adventure who is the rescuer rather than the rescued. Though as a girl who dreams of a fantasy world Sarah is often likened to Alice of Alice in Wonderland and The Wizard of Oz\u2019s Dorothy Gale, Watkins noted that Sarah differs from these characters as, unlike them, she does not \"blithely stumble into her adventure.\" Labyrinth's story is driven by Sarah's decisions, with her wishing Toby away serving as the plot's primary catalyst. Noting that while Sarah's love for her brother catalyzes her adventure, and her friendships give her strength, Leah Schnelbach of Tor.com identified Sarah's self-esteem and resilience as the qualities that ultimately enable her to defeat Jareth. Writing for The Black List Blog, Alissa Teige found that Sarah's dedication to rescuing her brother \"defines her as a model for bravery, self-reliance and perseverance,\" and the character's logical problem-solving methods in completing the Labyrinth \"shows girls that they can defeat any obstacle, if they put their minds to it\". Sophie Mayer of The Guardian penned, \u201cEqually adept at using her lipstick as a cunning [marking] tool or fighting off goblin soldiers, Sarah [is] adept and affective, neither hyper-feminine nor forced into a masculinised version of heroism.\" Jessica Ellis of HelloGiggles wrote that the character's stereotypically feminine traits, such as Sarah's ability to think creatively and to empathize, work to her advantage as she utilises them repeatedly in her quest. Mary Rockcastle of Bust observed that \"While Sarah is meant to look na\u00efve, her decisions are quick and precise and she knows exactly how to use both her friends and her enemies to her advantage.\" Sarah actively resists temptation and distractions from her quest; when Sarah is subjected to Jareth's erratic whims and elaborate obstacles, Mattson wrote, \"she actively resists his narrative, twisting the conflicts around to suit her needs until Jareth becomes the one reacting to her.\" Critics identify Sarah's realisation of her own agency as one of the film's most significant themes, culminated at the climax in her final remembrance and actualisation of the words, \"You have no power over me\".\n\n\n=== Archetypal analysis ===\nSarah is identified as the Hero archetype in the Hero's journey monomyth. A. C. Wise cited Labyrinth as an example of Maureen Murdock's female-centric Heroine's journey model, \"an inward-facing journey that teaches the heroine about herself, a focus on family, and the importance of friendship.\" The St. Louis Post-Dispatch's Joe Pollack wrote that Sarah's rescue of Ludo, \"a shaggy behemoth\", is a retelling of the fable \"The Lion and the Mouse\". Discerning Labyrinth as having Christian themes, Donna White in her contribution to the book The Antic Art: Enhancing Children's Literary Experiences Through Film and Video identified Sarah as a Christ figure because she is betrayed by Hoggle, \"who is himself a Judas figure\", and is continually tempted by a Satan-like Jareth. Sarah's final confrontation with Jareth takes place at the top of his castle, where he tempts her to give up her autonomy, similar to Satan's temptation of Christ on the mountain top. Brian Froud said that Sarah's eating of the peach is symbolic of \"the apple that Eve is tempted with\", and \"about [Sarah] entering into another phase of her life, a sensual phase ... to grow up and to have knowledge of other things.\" AllMusic critic Steven McDonald discerned Labyrinth as a \"variant on the Persephone story\".The film has also been interpreted by some critics as a modern variant of the fairy tale Beauty and the Beast. Fairy Tale Review drew comparisons between Sarah and the heroine of Beauty and the Beast, observing that Sarah similarly is self-sacrificing for the sake of a family member, dances and argues with a \"lonely and cruel\" prince, and eventually breaks his heart. However, Sarah Monette of Uncanny Magazine refuted that Labyrinth is a retelling of Beauty and the Beast because Sarah does not reform Jareth, and wrote, \"Just as Sarah refuses Jareth, Labyrinth refuses the incredibly dangerous myth that the \u201clove of a good woman\u201d can change a brute (beast) into a prince\".\n\n\n== Reception ==\n\n\n=== Critical response ===\nInitial reception to the character from film critics was mixed. Allen Malmquist of Cinefantastique deemed Sarah \"a passable hero\" but found that \"her riddle-solving ability comes out of nowhere, and her moments of cleverness ... come too seldom to really make you respect and root for her.\" Writing for The Times, Geoff Brown described her as a \"bland, brattish young heroine\" who \"invites indifference, not sympathy\". Rita Rose of The Indianapolis Star opined that because Sarah wishes away her brother, her attempt to get him back is \"a heartless endeavor [that] makes it hard for us to care about her journey: Toby, after all, is better off with the jolly goblins than his nasty sister.\" Meanwhile, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch's Joe Pollack called Sarah a \"heroine who is allowed to redeem her terrible mistake\". Francie Noyes of The Arizona Republic felt that the film does not give enough focus to her character: \"She is given little to do but push on bravely through yet another adventure. Jareth is more dynamic and the dwarf Hoggle is more endearing than Sarah is allowed to be.\" While several reviewers considered Sarah to be overshadowed by the film's puppet characters and visual effects, David Sterritt of The Christian Science Monitor found the film engaging \"largely because of its empathy with [Sarah] -- who's always at the center of the tale, giving it a human focus that outweighs the show-offy gimmicks and crazy costumes.\"Describing the character as \"an attractively self-possessed child-woman on a purposeful journey\", Michael Walsh of The Province wrote, \"Sarah is a contemporary teen with a timeless appeal.\" Barry Norman, reviewing Labyrinth for Film '86, felt that Sarah was not entirely believable as \"like most American teenagers, she seems too worldly and experienced to have much belief in fairies and goblins\", a view also expressed by Ann Totterdell in The Financial Times. While acknowledging that the character matures over her adventure in the Labyrinth, Sheila Benson of the Los Angeles Times considered Sarah to be too unlikeable. Paul Attanasio of The Washington Post felt that the film and character lacked a clear moral and that \"all Sarah learns is some vague sense of her own independence\". Describing Sarah as \"a curiously eccentric and seriously snooty teenager\", Joe Baltake of The Philadelphia Inquirer believed the film's lessons about \"maturity, responsibility and the real world\" are undermined by the final scene in which Sarah is reunited with her friends from the Labyrinth, \"illustrating that Sarah is addicted to her make-believe world more than ever\".Sarah has garnered a more positive reception in decades since Labyrinth's release. Heather Roche of the Times Colonist wrote that the character's \"perseverance in solving the labyrinth is inspiring, and sends a great message to any viewers.\" Emmet Asher-Perrin of Tor.com wrote, \"For all that she whine[s], she [is] a relatable protagonist, particularly to anyone who was ever accused of getting 'lost in their head' as a child.\" Daniel Richardson of UNILAD similarly found Sarah \"completely relatable as an archetypal teenager\", writing that the character's \"contemporary woes ... are perfect, as she bemoans her stepmother and insists she shouldn\u2019t be in trouble for getting home late. Zaki Hasan of Fandor wrote favourably of Sarah as \"an intelligent young woman, neither portrayed in stereotypical terms nor baselessly sexualized,\" who \"never loses her agency, even as sinister forces conspire to keep her from her goal.\" Describing the character as a \"hormonal hurricane ... bratty and forthright but impossibly likeable\", Josh Winning of Total Film wrote, \"In-between her numerous rants of \"It's not fair!\", Sarah's brash sensibilities mean she's at least clever enough not to act intimidated by the Goblin King even if her insides are shuddering ... Not only that, but she defeats her foe by using her brains, and doesn't rely on Prince Charming to come to her rescue.\" Writing for The Odyssey, Julia Kell praised Sarah's complexity and character growth, writing that her bravery and perseverance are \"incredibly inspiring to see in a young girl.\" In a 2012 retrospective of Labyrinth, Vulture's Rebecca Milzoff found it \"refreshing ... how Labyrinth offer[s] up a different kind of heroine than the Disney princess movies\", as Sarah's goal is not to fall in love or find a husband. Contrasting Labyrinth to contemporary 1980s films about teenagers, Sarah Monette of Uncanny Magazine found Sarah's character offers teenage girls the \"vanishingly rare\" message that \"it's okay not to want the sexualized, exaggeratedly feminine version of adulthood represented by [Sarah's] ridiculous white dress\" and that having a boyfriend \"is not a victory condition\" nor essential to growing up.Jennifer Connelly's performance as Sarah initially polarized critics and received strong criticism from some reviewers. Los Angeles Daily News critic Kirk Honeycutt referred to Connelly as \"a bland and minimally talented young actress\", while Gene Siskel of the Chicago Tribune dismissed her as \"forgettable\". Noting the importance of the role, Nina Darnton of The New York Times found Connelly's portrayal of Sarah \"disappointing\", saying, \"She looks right, but she lacks conviction\". Writing for The Miami News, Jon Marlowe opined, \"Connelly is simply the wrong person for the right job. She has a squeaky voice that begins to grate on you; when she cries, you can see the onions in her eyes.\" Contrary to these negative views, other critics praised her performance. The Hartford Courant's Malcolm L. Johnson praised her as engaging, \"pretty, fresh and feisty\", while Lucy Choate Eckberg of Winona Daily News opined that Connelly \"steals the show in her portrayal of Sarah\". Hailing Connelly as \"the most engaging heroine\" since Judy Garland in The Wizard of Oz and Elizabeth Taylor in National Velvet, Associated Press reporter Bob Thomas wrote that she \"has such a winning personality that she makes you believe in her plight and in the creatures she encounters\". Hal Lipper of the St. Petersburg Times similarly enthused that \"Connelly makes the entire experience seem real. She acts so naturally around the puppets that you begin to believe in their life-like qualities.\"Connelly's performance has garnered a more positive response in recent decades. Ian Nathan of Empire wrote, \"Connelly, still in the flush of youth, makes for an appealingly together kind of heroine,\" while Desson Thomson of The Washington Post described her portrayal of Sarah as \"precociously appealing\" and \"spunky\". Brigdet McGovern of Tor.com wrote: \"It's a tribute to Jennifer Connelly's performance that Sarah manages to exhibit all the hyper-dramatic martyrdom of your average 16-year-old while still seeming sympathetic and likeable \u2014 it's easy to identify with her\". While finding Sarah to be \"far from the most interesting protagonist\", Brian Bitner of JoBlo.com praised Connelly's \"incredible talent\" for giving Sarah \"humanity, grace, humor, and defiance.\" Michael Booth of The Denver Post wrote that \"Connelly's glinting eyes and native intelligence carry the film\". Glamour's Ella Alexander praised Connelly's portrayal of the protagonist as \"empowering\", while Liz Cookman of The Guardian wrote, \"She is confident and good-looking, yet not as overtly sexual as women are so often portrayed on-screen \u2013 a much stronger female role model than many available today.\"\n\n\n== Legacy ==\nDespite disappointing box office sales in the United States upon initial release, Labyrinth was later a success on home video and television broadcasts, becoming a cult film. The film's lasting popularity and cult status have been attributed in large part to Sarah's character arc and Connelly's performance. Emma Islip of Comic Book Resources wrote in 2020, \"To this day, viewers are invested in [Sarah's] trial and error coming of age story, personality, and place in the imaginative world. [Connelly's] acting abilities and charisma are what makes Labyrinth such a triumphant feat.\" Uproxx's Alyssa Fikse reflected that many viewers see themselves in Sarah as she \"reflect[s] that mix of fear and potential\" in \"standing on the brink of growing up [...] one of the scariest times in everyone's life\". Ed Power of The Telegraph attributed Labyrinth's longevity to its being \"a rare ... movie that takes seriously the experience of being a young woman finding her way in the world.\" IGN's Kayleigh Donaldson agreed with this assessment, and wrote, \"The aesthetics of the film hypnotize but it\u2019s Sarah\u2019s victory over Jareth that we love so much.\"Sarah's character resonates especially with the film's female audience. According to Eric Diaz of Nerdist, \"Henson\u2019s attempt at a modern Alice in Wonderland story particularly resonated with thousands of young girls who saw themselves in [Sarah]\", and the rarity of girls placed in the centre of heroic adventure fantasies is one reason why \"so many girls of a certain age treat Labyrinth like it's their Star Wars.\" Demetria Slyt of the University of North Dakota wrote that Sarah's line, \"You have no power over me\", in particular \"could have and probably has had a huge impact on young women\" learning to assert their individual agency as they mature. Recounting that Sarah's rejection of Jareth was the first instance she ever saw of a woman rejecting a man in a film, Mary Rockcastle of Bust wrote that the character's actions send a \"vital message\", stating that \"Little girls especially need to see movies where girls don\u2019t succumb to unhealthy relationships but instead fight for their family over for love.\"Metro included Sarah on its list of \"19 women every 90s schoolgirl wanted to be when she grew up\", while Bustle featured Sarah in its article \"7 Feminist Childhood Movie Characters That Made You The Woman You Are Today\", writing that the character is a strong role model for girls because \"once she realizes that the world isn't fair and she's in charge of her own destiny, she can do anything.\" Mom.com ranked Sarah on their list of the \"50 Best Movie Heroines of All Time\", citing her \"cleverness, resourcefulness and bravery\". SyFy Wire described Labyrinth as \"one of the best depictions of female maturation and desire in pop culture of the '80s\", while The Arizona Republic characterised it as one of \"8 of the best movies that celebrate girl power\" due to Sarah's \"determination and moxie\" in solving the Labyrinth.Connelly's role as Sarah brought her international fame and made her a teen icon. Described by the International Business Times as the role that made Connelly \"everyone's crush\", the character has remained one of Connelly's best known performances. In 1997, Connelly said, \"I still get recognized for Labyrinth by little girls in the weirdest places. I can't believe they still recognize me from that movie. It's on TV all the time and I guess I pretty much look the same.\" In 2008, Connelly said she found it amusing that many people continued to recognise her as Sarah two decades after she worked on the film.Sarah's silver ballgown in the masquerade scene has been named as one of the \"most iconic\" dresses in movie history by Cosmopolitan, Wonderwall and Livingly, the latter calling it \"as bold and theatrical as the movie itself.\" Stylist ranked Sarah's costume change from \"baggy jeans and an embroidered waistcoat\" into her \"fantastical ballgown, with matching '80s hairstyle\" among the \"50 Best Movie Makeovers\". The costumes Connelly wore as the character are displayed at the Museum of the Moving Image's exhibition The Jim Henson Exhibition: Imagination Unlimited, which premiered at the Museum of Pop Culture in Seattle before opening at its permanent home in New York City in 2017. UK bed retailer Dreams ranked Sarah's bedroom as the sixth \"most iconic\" bedroom from film and television, writing that it \"perfectly exemplifies the 80's teenage girl room, with plenty of posters, floral bedroom furniture and stuffed toys that turn out to be the characters she meets on her quest\".\n\n\n== Other appearances ==\nSarah appears in Labyrinth's tie-in adaptations, which include the novelisation by A. C. H. Smith and the three-issue comic book adaptation published by Marvel Comics, which was first released in a single volume as Marvel Super Special #40 in 1986. She also appears in the film's picture book adaptation, photo album, and read-along story book.\n\n\n=== Novelisation ===\nSmith's novelisation of Labyrinth expands on Sarah's relationship with her absent mother, stage-actress Linda Williams, who had left Sarah and her father some years previously. In the film, various photos of Linda and her co-star lover (actually Connelly's mother photographed with David Bowie) are briefly shown in Sarah's bedroom along with newspaper clippings reporting their \u201con-off romance\u201d. Sarah idolises both her mother and the boyfriend, named Jeremy in the novelisation; the book elaborates on Sarah aspiring to follow their example to become an actress and fantasising about living their celebrity lifestyle. After her adventure in the Labyrinth, having matured and re-evaluated her life, Sarah puts all of the clippings of Linda and Jeremy away as well as the music box that her mother had given her.\n\n\n=== \"As The World Falls Down\" music video ===\nSarah appears in the promotional music video for David Bowie's song \"As The World Falls Down\" from the Labyrinth soundtrack. Directed by Steve Barron in 1986, the video features French actress Charlotte Valandrey alongside footage of Jennifer Connelly taken from the film.\n\n\n=== Spin-off comics ===\n\n\n==== Return to Labyrinth ====\n\nSarah appears in Return to Labyrinth, a four-volume original English-language manga sequel to the film created by Jake T. Forbes and published by Tokyopop between 2006 and 2010. She is a supporting character in the series, which is set over a decade after the events of the film. After failing to get into the Juilliard School, Sarah has abandoned her ambitions to become an actress and lives a subdued life as an English teacher. She shares a close relationship with her brother Toby, who by this time is a teenager. Sarah is visited by Jareth, who has abdicated his throne and left the Labyrinth to Toby so that he could seek her out in the human world. Still in love with Sarah and desiring her as his queen, Jareth is disappointed to discover that she does not remember him and has discarded her fairy-tale fantasies for a more practical life. With the world of the Labyrinth in a deteriorating state and Jareth's powers weakening, he uses the last of his magic to jog Sarah's memories of him and the Labyrinth and attempts to entice her to create a new world with him from their shared dreams. However, Sarah wishes to preserve her friends from the Labyrinth, and realises her dreams by writing stories, allowing the existence of everyone in the Labyrinth to continue.\n\n\n==== Archaia Entertainment comics ====\nSarah appears in Labyrinth: Coronation, a 12-issue comic series written by Simon Spurrier and published by Archaia Entertainment between 2018 and 2019. Her character and story arc is the same as that of the film, while the comic concurrently follows the parallel tale of Maria, another young woman who journeys through the Labyrinth to save a loved one, set several hundred years before Sarah. However, Maria ultimately fails to rescue her infant son, Jareth. The Labyrinth that Sarah traverses is very different to Maria's, as in the series the Labyrinth becomes shaped to reflect and challenge each individual who attempts to solve it.Sarah has a minor appearance in Labyrinth: Masquerade, a one-shot story published by Archaia in 2020 about the ballgoers in her masquerade dream.\n\n\n=== Merchandise ===\nSarah features in Labyrinth merchandise such as colouring and activity books, posters, and lobby cards.\nA Funko Pop figurine of Sarah was released in 2016, which also came with a miniature figure of the Worm, a minor character from the film. Weta Workshop announced in July 2021 a vinyl figurine of Sarah as a part of its Mini Epics line.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\nBibliography\n\n\n== External links ==\nJennifer Connelly's audition for the role of Sarah (video)\nSarah on IMDb\nSarah at Comic Vine", "infobox": {"colour": "#F3E0AA", "image": "File:Jennifer_Connelly_as_Sarah_Williams.jpg", "caption": "[[Jennifer Connelly]] as Sarah in ''[[Labyrinth (1986 film)|Labyrinth]]'' (1986).", "name": "Sarah Williams", "first": "''[[Labyrinth (1986 film)|Labyrinth]]'' (1986)", "creator": "{{unbulleted list | [[Jim Henson]] | [[Dennis Lee (author)|Dennis Lee]]}}", "portrayer": "[[Jennifer Connelly]]", "designer": "[[Brian Froud]]", "nationality": "[[Americans|American]]", "relatives": "{{unbulleted list | Linda Williams|efn|In Sarah's room, a scrapbook of newspaper clippings about a stage actress named Linda Williams is marked in handwriting as \"MOM\" drawn with hearts.|ref|{{cite book |first1=Andrew |last1=DeGraff |first2=A.

Scribbly Jibbet is a semi-autobiographical character, presenting the adventures of a young man starting out in the cartooning business, and working for the Morning Dispatch newspaper. His stories were told around the Golden Age era, when American Comic Books were primarily anthologies telling more than one story in a magazine issue. Scribbly first appeared in the Popular Comics series, and then appeared in All-American Comics from 1939 to 1944. He was then revived in his own series, Scribbly, from 1948 to 1952.\nAll-American was one of the two companies that merged to form DC Comics in the 1940s, and, like all of DC's Golden Age characters, Scribbly was later considered part of the \"Earth-Two\" continuity. In 2015, Scribbly was briefly revived in DC Comics continuity by Paul Levitz, in the miniseries Convergence: World's Finest Comics.\n\n\n== Publication history ==\n\n\n=== Dell Comics ===\nSheldon Mayer began his career in cartooning at age fifteen, and he created Scribbly when he was nineteen. Mayer later explained: \"Scribbly was a thing I dreamed up during my lunch hour one day in the cafeteria... I followed the old rule of writing only what you know about. What was more natural than writing about the adventures of a boy cartoonist?\"In 1936, Mayer worked for Max Gaines, one of the pioneers of modern comic books, and the teenager's job was to cut and paste comic strips from the Sunday comics pages into a comic book layout, which Gaines would sell to Dell Comics, to publish in one of their anthology books. Along with the recut strips, Mayer included a one-page strip of his own, Scribbly the Boy Cartoonist, and this was published in Dell's Popular Comics #6 (July 1936), alongside established strips like Smokey Stover, Winnie Winkle and Harold Teen. Jean-Paul Gabilliet said: \"[Mayer] presented all the pages as Sunday panels because, at the time, the fact that a strip had previously appeared in a newspaper was perceived as an indicator of quality\". Scribbly strips also appeared in Dell's The Funnies later in 1936.\nAndrew J. Kunka describes the way that the strip began: \"In the earliest Dell-published strips, Mayer's series begins with Scribbly as a kid known in his neighborhood for drawing cartoons on any surface he can find, including walls and fences (something Mayer did in his youth, as well). These drawings are discovered by a famous cartoonist, Ving Parker, who happens to be Scribbly's hero. Ving takes on Scribbly as an apprentice and even introduces him to real-life cartoonists like Lank Leonard (Mickey Finn) and Milt Gross. Scribbly's strip quickly catches on, and while he tries to work from home, his brother, Dinky, inadvertently gives him even more material. This early iteration of the series, before Mayer moves to All-American, eventually shifts to pure slapstick and less about Scribbly's cartooning experiences\".A remarkable aspect of the comic is that Scribbly is creating his own autobiographical comic: \"Why Big Brothers Leave Home\", about his relationship with the pesky Dinky (himself based on Mayer's little brother, Monte). In most of the Scribbly comics, \"Why Big Brothers Leave Home\" strip appeared as a topper strip, either at the top or the bottom of the page, drawn in cruder form to indicate that it was a cartoon-within-a-cartoon. Readers were encouraged to send in ideas for \"Why Big Brothers Leave Home\", collaborating with Scribbly on his autobiography.At one point in the strip, \"Why Big Brothers Leave Home\" becomes so popular that Scribbly's principal creates his own autobiographical strip, \"Scene in P.S. 83 as Seen by the Principal\". A teacher in the school is unhappy with the way that she's portrayed in the principal's strip, and starts a cartoon of her own.\n\n\n=== All-American Publications ===\n\nIn 1938, Gaines struck out on his own, founding All-American Publications. Mayer remained at the company as cartoonist and editor, and Scribbly appeared in All American Comics, beginning with the first issue (April 1939) and continuing until issue #59 (July 1944). Scribbly appeared on the All-American cover only three times, including issue #2.Scribbly worked for the Morning Dispatch newspaper, although most of the action in the strip took place in his New York neighborhood. In issue #3 of All-American Comics, Mayer introduced Ma Hunkel, the owner of a local grocery store. In another autobiographical touch, Ma Hunkel was inspired by the owner of a boarding house where Mayer lived, Mrs. Lindenbaum.With the skyrocketing popularity of the Superman comic in 1938, comic book publishers began featuring their own superhero characters. All-American Comics responded in 1939 with Gary Concord, the Ultra-Man, and followed in 1940 with Green Lantern and the Atom. The superhero trend was so powerful that in the Scribbly story in issue #20 (Nov 1940), Ma Hunkel became a superhero herself. In the story, Scribbly's little brother and Ma Hunkel's daughter Sisty are kidnapped, and the police are unable to locate them. Scribbly tells Ma about the Green Lantern, and she's inspired to don a costume and fight crime, calling herself the Red Tornado. By issue #23, the Red Tornado was sharing billing with Scribbly, and in #24, Ma's two kids joined the fight against crime, calling themselves \"the Cyclone Twins\". The kids scared criminals more than the Tornado herself. The series continued for three more years as \"Scribbly & the Red Tornado\".Ron Goulart writes: \"Anticipating Wonder Woman, that monumental creation of William Moulton Marston, possibly even influencing it, Mayer chose a woman to be his costumed avenger, remaking the formidable Ma Hunkel into the even more formidable Red Tornado. Actually the people in the strip never knew the true sex of the Tornado. They only knew that this bulky figure in the red flannels, bedroom slippers, cape, and inverted stew pot could be counted on to tackle all sorts of criminals from the biggest to the smallest\".In fact, Ma Hunkel had a one-page cameo in the first JSA story, in All-Star Comics #3. The story, \"The First Meeting of the Justice Society of America\", has the heroes get together and swap stories about their heroics, and after hearing tales from the Flash, Hawkman, the Spectre and the Hour Man, the group notices that the Red Tornado is in the room. She explains that she wasn't invited to the meeting, but she came up on the fire escape. She gets a warm greeting from the group, but when they invite her to take her cape off and relax, she suddenly announces that she has to leave. The Flash laughs when he discovers that she tore her pants when she climbed in through the window. Later Justice Society stories established that Ma is an honorary member of the team, and in 2007, she returned to DC in Justice Society of America vol. 3 as the curator of the JSA's museum.\nIn All-American Comics #45 (Dec 1942), Mayer himself entered the comic strip. In \"Sheldon Mayer Meets the Red Tornado\", Scribbly, Ma Hunkel and the neighborhood kids are complaining that their stories are boring and repetitive, so Mayer enters the comic panels to respond to their complaints. Disheartened by their criticism, Mayer tries to commit suicide by jumping from the top panel, but the Red Tornado rushes to catch him before he hits the bottom panel.Outside of usually appearing in All-American Comics, Scribbly also appeared occasionally in Comic Cavalcade and also in the humor series, Buzzy.By issue #59 (July 1944), Mayer had grown tired of the characters, and openly admitted it in the introduction to that issue's story: \"This goes on every issue \u2014 sometimes it's funny \u2014 sometimes it isn't \u2014 anyhow \u2014 I'm getting a little tired of it \u2014 just this once I'm gonna have some FUN! F'rinstance let's see what would happen if instead of people we draw these characters as animals...\" Mayer then explained that Scribbly would be a horse in this issue \u2014 \"maybe it's because I always know where to find a horse, but I go nuts finding an idea for Scribbly\" \u2014 while Ma Hunkel would be a big fat chicken, Sisty as a chick and Dinky as a pony. This talking animal story was the last \"Scribbly\" story in All-American, with Mayer presumably tired of the strip altogether. Mayer's next project was a talking animal humor book, Funny Stuff, which launched with a Summer 1944 issue, with new stars the Three Mouseketeers and McSnurtle the Turtle, the Terrific Whatzit.One final \"Scribbly\" chapter was published in the one-shot giant The Big All-American Comic Book, dated December 1944.\n\n\n=== Solo comic ===\nWhen Archie made teen humor comics popular, Scribbly was given his own bimonthly title, Scribbly, which ran for 15 issues, starting in September 1948. Mayer continued to write and draw the title, which is a romantic comedy about Scribbly trying to find a steady job and win his girlfriend's affection. The Red Tornado didn't appear in this reboot of the strip. Scribbly's sales were unimpressive, and Mayer was more interested in his new comic, Leave It to Binky, so the Scribbly comic was dropped in January 1952. Scribbly did appear as a backup feature in Leave it to Binky, as well as Buzzy, another DC teen comic.\n\n\n=== Convergence ===\nIn 2015, Scribbly was briefly revived in DC Comics continuity by Paul Levitz, in the miniseries Convergence: World's Finest Comics. In the series, he's depicted as transcribing the events of the Seven Soldiers of Victory by Paul Levitz, Jim Fern, Joe Rubenstein and Shannon Wheeler.In an interview by Comic Book Resources, Paul Levitz explained his revival of the character: \n\n\"I built this around Scribbly Jibbet, whose name you will probably not remember. I guess he's the only character in the DC Universe who preceeds [sic] DC. Shelly Mayer created Scribbly originally, as a boy. His Scribbly stories -- in the view of Art Spiegelman, who is very knowledgeable on such -- is arguably the first autobiographical example of a cartoonist writing about a cartoonist in America. Shelly created it at first for Dell, but then he brought it to DC when he became the first editor of All-American Comics. He did a run in that comic and then did about 15 issues of Scribbly's own comic\".\n\n\n== Reception ==\nCartoonist and satirist Jules Feiffer wrote in The Great Comic Book Heroes (1965) that \"the single unique stroke in the pre Detective Comics days was the creation, by Sheldon Mayer, of the humor strip Scribbly \u2014 an underrated, often brilliantly wild cartoon about a boy cartoonist with whom, needless to say, I identified like mad. I regret that it is not within the province of this book to give Mayer or Scribbly the space both of them deserve\".The revival of Scribbly in Convergence got a negative review by Greg McElhatton in Comic Book Resources, opining that it would have been better if the comic \"focused more on what it's like to be a cartoonist in a superhero world\". He also felt that some of the art for Scribbly was off.In the 2013 book Comics About Cartoonists: Tales of the World's Oddest Profession, comics historian Craig Yoe described Scribbly as \"the greatest out-of-the-inkwell cartoonist of all\". The book reprints six pages of Scribbly comics.\n\n\n== Other versions ==\nIn DC Comics satire children's comic book, DC Super Friends #29, he is referenced by a young Batman as a famous artist who draws his feet too small.\n\n\n== References ==", "infobox": {"image": "ScribblyJibblet.jpg", "caption": "Scribbly as he appeared in ''Scribbly'' #1 (September 1948).", "character_name": "Scribbly", "full_name": "Scribbly Jibbet", "publisher": "[[Dell Comics]]<br>[[DC Comics]]", "debut": "''Popular Comics'' #6 (July 1936)", "creators": "[[Sheldon Mayer]]"}, "wikidata": {"Google Knowledge Graph ID (P2671)": "/g/11fkyppsqt"}, "cat": "Comics_characters", "url": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scribbly_the_Boy_Cartoonist"}, {"name": "Cordelia Chase", "url_name": "37574", "txt": "Cordelia Chase is a fictional character created by Joss Whedon for the television series Buffy the Vampire Slayer; she also appeared on Buffy's spin-off series, Angel. Portrayed by Charisma Carpenter, the character appears as a series regular in the first three seasons of Buffy, before leaving the show and becoming a series regular during the first four seasons of Angel. The character made her last television appearance in 2004, appearing as a special guest star in Angel's 100th episode. Cordelia also appears in both canonical and apocryphal Buffy and Angel material such as comic books and novels.\nCordelia is introduced in \"Welcome to the Hellmouth\" as one of Sunnydale High's popular students, attending school alongside vampire slayer Buffy Summers. Through her interactions with Buffy and her friends, she comes to accept the existence of supernatural forces and helps Buffy fight against them. In the television series Angel, Cordelia joins Angel, a heroic vampire with a soul, in forming a detective agency dedicated to stopping supernatural forces and helping the helpless. After Cordelia acquires the ability to see visions of those in need, she becomes a more compassionate and heroic character. In the middle of the third season, she becomes a love interest of the protagonist Angel. In the fourth season of Angel, she appears to take on a villainous role before it is revealed that she is possessed by a malevolent deity; this storyline eventually leads to her death and subsequent exit from the series. The character makes further canonical appearances in the comic books Buffy Season Eight and Angel: After the Fall, in a dream flashback and as a spirit guide.\nCreated as a foil for Buffy's titular heroine, Cordelia was initially characterized as \"shallow\", \"vain\" and \"self-centered\", and was used in the series to create conflict for the other characters. The character went through changes as she gradually redeemed herself throughout the course of Buffy and Angel, and has received attention in academic texts related to gender studies and social status.\n\n\n== Appearances ==\n\n\n=== Television ===\nCordelia Chase first appears in the premiere episode of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, titled \"Welcome to the Hellmouth\". Introduced as a potential friend for Sunnydale High's newest student, Buffy Summers (Sarah Michelle Gellar), Cordelia reveals her true colors by cruelly mocking Willow (Alyson Hannigan) whom Buffy befriends instead. Ignorant of the supernatural, Cordelia shows up regularly throughout the first season of Buffy to insult and ridicule the other characters. She plays a larger role in the episode \"Out of Mind, Out of Sight\", in which she falls victim to a social outcast who wants revenge on popular students for ignoring her so much that she turned invisible. In the season finale, Cordelia helps Buffy and her friends battle vampires, finally coming to terms with the existence of supernatural forces. In season two, Cordelia becomes a more active ally to the \"Scooby Gang\" and begins a romantic relationship with Xander Harris (Nicholas Brendon) in \"Bewitched, Bothered and Bewildered.\" Dating someone of Xander's social status causes Cordelia's ostracism from her popular peers and she reluctantly breaks up with him. However, when Xander performs a love spell to pay her back for hurting him, Cordelia realises how much he cares about her and takes him back, rejecting her superficial friends in the process. In season three's \"Lovers Walk\", Cordelia is heartbroken to see Xander kissing Willow and ends their relationship. By the season three episode \"The Wish\", Cordelia slips back into her antagonistic persona from the first season, disassociating herself from the Scooby Gang altogether. In the episode \"The Prom\", she reveals that her house and her family's entire wealth has just been seized for tax fraud and both of her parents (never named or seen on-camera) are now in prison. Cordelia later attempts an unsuccessful relationship with Wesley (Alexis Denisof) and makes peace with Xander at the prom. In the season three finale, she rallies alongside Buffy and her friends at graduation against the demonic Mayor of Sunnydale (Harry Groener), where Cordelia slays her first vampire.After three seasons on Buffy, Cordelia left the series to move over to star in Angel, a spin-off series focusing on Buffy's vampire ex-lover Angel (David Boreanaz). The first season of Angel sees Cordelia move to Los Angeles, in the hopes of escaping her new-found poverty by becoming an actress. After Angel saves her life in the series pilot, Cordelia helps him found the supernatural detective agency Angel Investigations, working in an administrative position. She also becomes close to half-demon co-worker Doyle (Glenn Quinn), but their budding romance is ended by his death nine episodes into the series. Before dying in the episode \"Hero\", Doyle passes his ability to see people in distress over to Cordelia when he kisses her. Although she initially views the visions as a curse, in the season one finale, a demon causes Cordelia's visions to overwhelm her - causing her to experience worldwide pain - and upon her recovery she vows to help those in need. In season two's \"Reunion\", Cordelia and the other staff at Angel Investigations are fired by Angel, who is becoming increasingly obsessed with bringing down the evil law firm Wolfram & Hart. Cordelia joins Wesley and Charles Gunn (J. August Richards) in re-forming the agency on their own. Angel and Cordelia eventually reconcile in the episode \"Epiphany\". As her acting career continues to flounder, Cordelia is sucked into and made princess of a medieval hell dimension called Pylea in the season two episode \"Over the Rainbow\". When presented with the opportunity to pass her visions over to a champion named the Groosalugg (Mark Lutz), Cordelia refuses and returns to L.A. with her friends in the season two finale.In season three's \"Birthday\", Cordelia learns from the demon Skip (David Denman) that her visions are slowly killing her because human beings are not strong enough to control them. To save her life, Cordelia accepts Skip's offer to alter history so that she never met Angel in L.A., instead landing her big break as an actress. However, even in this alternate timeline, Cordelia feels compelled to help others and eventually crosses paths with Angel again, who received the visions in her place and is now insane. Unable to let her friend suffer, Cordelia has Skip return the timeline to normal, and agrees to become half-demon, with new powers, in order to harbor the visions safely. This season also sees Angel become a father, with Cordelia stepping in to mother the infant Connor until he is kidnapped into a hell dimension in the episode \"Sleep Tight\", only to emerge as a disturbed teenager (Vincent Kartheiser) in \"The Price\". In the episode \"Waiting in the Wings\", Angel realizes he has romantic feelings for Cordelia, but is prevented from voicing them by the return of Groosalugg. Cordelia dates Groosalugg for the remainder of the season, but Groo notices she loves Angel instead and decides to leave. In the season finale, Cordelia arranges to meet Angel to confess her feelings, but is prevented from doing so by Skip, who informs her that she has become a higher being. Cordelia accepts her duty, and leaves Earth for another dimension. In season four, Cordelia feels trapped in her position as a higher being, and so in the episode \"The House Always Wins\" she returns to Earth in an amnesiac state. In \"Spin the Bottle\", her memories are returned via a spell, along with a vision of a mysterious Beast (Vladimir Kulich). Afterward, she admits to Angel the feelings she once had for him. As L.A. succumbs to the apocalypse in season four's \"Apocalypse, Nowish\", Cordelia begins to behave out-of-character; she seduces Connor, murders Lilah (Stephanie Romanov) in the episode \"Calvary\", commands the Beast in \"Salvage\", and magically battles former friend Willow to keep Angel from his soul in the episode \"Orpheus\". In season four's \"Players\", the team realize that the now pregnant Cordelia is possessed, so Cordelia takes the unstable Connor on the run with her so they may give birth to their supernatural offspring, Jasmine (Gina Torres). In \"Inside Out\", Skip explains that Jasmine is his master, and a higher being who possessed Cordelia before her returning to Earth, manipulating events to be born in a new body of her own.Cordelia falls into a post-natal coma for the remainder of season four. Following an eleven-episode absence, Cordelia returns to Angel in season five, in the 100th episode \"You're Welcome\". Having (apparently) awoken from her coma, Cordelia reunites with Angel Investigations, who she discovers have taken over Wolfram & Hart since their defeat of Jasmine. She chastises Angel for accepting W&H's \"deal with the devil\" and reminds him of his true mission and higher calling. Together, they face and defeat their old enemy, Lindsey McDonald (Christian Kane) who had been impersonating Doyle in an attempt to destroy Angel. In the episode's closing moments, Cordelia reiterates to Angel that she loves him and kisses him, shortly before he receives a phone call reporting that Cordelia died that morning in the hospital. When Angel turns around, Cordelia is gone. It is later revealed that this encounter - the Powers That Be repaying their debt to Cordelia - allowed Cordelia to pass one last vision over to Angel, giving him the knowledge he needs to bring down the Circle of the Black Thorn.Between 2001 and 2004, Joss Whedon and Jeph Loeb developed a 4-minute pilot episode for Buffy the Animated Series, which was set during the show's first season. Had the series been picked up by a network, it would have featured Cordelia (voiced by Charisma Carpenter) in more high-school adventures. Following a 2008 leak of the pilot to YouTube, Loeb expressed some hope that the series may be resurrected in some form.\n\n\n=== Literature ===\nCordelia also appears in comic books and novels based on the Buffy and Angel television series. The Cordelia Collection, Vol. 1 by Nancy Krulik is a novelization of the Buffy episodes \"Out of Mind, Out of Sight\", \"Some Assembly Required\" and \"Homecoming\". These episodes tell specific incidents in which Cordelia becomes targeted: by a scorned classmate, to become a zombie's bride and by hunters in a case of mistaken identity. She appears in numerous Angel novels as a member of Angel Investigations, but some feature Cordelia more prominently; in Not Forgotten she uncovers exploitation of child immigrants, while in Haunted she appears as a contestant on a supernatural-themed reality television show when she has a vision about another applicant. Cordelia appears in the majority of Angel comics, published by Dark Horse Comics during 2000\u20132002 and set between episodes of the television series. She appears less frequently in those by IDW Publishing between 2005 and 2011, mainly in stories set in and after the fifth season. Cordelia typically plays a minimal role in the Dark Horse Angel comics. However, issue seventeen was a \"Cordelia Special\", in which demonic items are stashed in Cordelia's apartment. In the Dark Horse Presents story \"Lovely dark and deep\", Cordelia lands a role as the star of a demonic movie. Cordelia appears in the IDW Publishing comic mini-series Angel: The Curse, set after season five, in flashback scenes. She subsequently reappears in the mini-series Angel: Old Friends, which sees Angel battle evil clones of his friends. Cordelia claims to be the genuine article, having returned from the dead, but Angel is unconvinced and kills her; his suspicions prove correct when her body immediately disintegrates like the other clones.Angel: After the Fall, a canonical comic book continuation of the television series plotted by Joss Whedon and written by Brian Lynch, features the characters of Angel and all of Los Angeles condemned to Hell after the events of the series finale \"Not Fade Away\". Cordelia does not appear until the twelfth issue, in which she acts as a guide to Angel in his dying moments; it is revealed she serves in some capacity as a higher power now. The character departs in issue thirteen. Cordelia also appears in a dream sequence within the twentieth issue of Buffy's canonical continuation, Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Eight, titled \"After These Messages... We'll Be Right Back!\". Buffy dreams of when she was in her first year at Sunnydale High; Cordelia's physical appearance is based on the art style of Loeb and Whedon's unproduced Buffy animated series.\n\n\n== Conception and casting ==\nCordelia was originally intended to serve as a dramatic foil to the series' main character Buffy Summers. Adapting the concept of the movie into a television series, Whedon decided to reinvent the character of Buffy. The shallow cheerleader of the 1992 Buffy film, as played by Kristy Swanson, had grown more mature and open-minded. Buffy now identified with the social outcasts, such as Willow and Xander. As a result, Cordelia Chase was created to embody the traits of that shallower Buffy. Despite portraying a shallow, valley girl stock character, actress Charisma Carpenter felt that Cordelia in early seasons was not \"one-dimensional\", nor was she \"as superficial as people thought\". At the same time, Carpenter was critical of her frequent role as the damsel in distress. Angel co-creator and executive producer David Greenwalt describes Cordelia in her Buffy years as \"a somewhat shallow, somewhat vain, somewhat self-centered but [a] lively and honest character who spoke her mind\". Indeed, even not when superhuman, she showed a lot of hardiness.\nCharisma Carpenter had originally planned to read for the role of Buffy, but was late for her audition and instead tried out for Cordelia. Carpenter, who had dressed casually for the role of Buffy\u2014who she believed \"could really be herself\"\u2014felt unprepared to read for Cordelia because she \"was definitely a character to dress for\". Although she had only fifteen minutes to prepare for the character, the producers were \"really responsive\" to Carpenter's audition, and she left feeling confident she had got the part. After Carpenter's audition, actress Sarah Michelle Gellar, who had been offered the role of Cordelia before Carpenter, was asked to come back and audition for the part of Buffy. Bianca Lawson originally won the role of Cordelia Chase, but turned it down due to other contractual obligations. Lawson would later be cast as vampire slayer Kendra in the show's second season. Carpenter, proud of her own character's growth across the two series, did not envy Gellar for winning the role of Buffy over her.\n\n\n== Characterization ==\n\n\n=== Characteristics and analysis ===\nCordelia's representation of an assertive modern woman and her character arc in Buffy has been commented on in several academic texts, particularly in gender studies, such as \"Praising Cordelia: Aggression and Adaptation Among Adolescent Girls\", or Sex and the Slayer. In the latter, Dr. Lorna Jowett of the University of Northampton describes Cordelia's initial place in the series where \"At first glance, Cordelia seems to have the 'normal life' Buffy often longs for. She is a familiar character from the teen drama: popular, a cheerleader, the center of cliques (power as status). Elizabeth Rambo notes how Cordelia's status is highlighted by her nickname, \"Queen C\", and Harmony's remark to her, \"Cordy, you reign.\" Cordelia functions recognizably as the typical female victim of horror, often screaming and running away, and this makes her a perfect contrast for other female characters.\"\"Praising Cordelia\" argues that both Buffy and Cordelia are representations of assertive and competitive young women, who \"represent two kinds of aggressive adolescent girls\". The article focuses on the competitive relationship between the characters. Buffy's initial friendship with Cordelia is compromised once Cordelia sees the attractive, socially competent Buffy as a threat to her. Even after Cordelia joins the Scooby Gang and becomes Buffy's friend, theirs is not a friendship of \"mutual support, warmth, and intimacy\" but rather one of \"mutual antipathy\". The authors opine that Cordelia, unlike Buffy, is a \"representation of the archetypal 'feminine type'\", one who conforms to the \"pervasive stereotypes of femininity while, at the same time, dominating the other girls in the school\" and commanding the attention of the boys. Describing her character arc in Buffy, Mary Alice Money views Cordelia as one of many transformed or redeemed Buffy characters, one who \"reveals a previously unexpected vulnerability that nullifies some of their less attractive traits.\" Jowett argues that Cordelia's assimilation within the main group is due largely to her relationship with main character Xander, and she is rendered sympathetic to the audience once they witness her rebuff the peer pressure from her old friends. She is further endeared to the viewer when Xander betrays her because the scenes showing her pain are shown only to the viewer. After Cordelia is cheated on by Xander with Willow she chooses not to go back to him and instead retains her autonomy.Others such as Susanne Kord and Elisabeth Krimer note how Cordelia is also a subversive representation of feminine stereotypes, describing \"Although superficially, Cordelia conforms to the stereotype of the insensitive bitch\", what she actually does is \"offers her viewers the clandestine pleasures of female self-assertion\". One of Cordelia's strongest traits, her honesty, is also highlighted in \"Earshot\", where Buffy temporarily develops telepathic powers and can hear the thoughts of her friends, who avoid her to hide these thoughts. For Cordelia however, \"her thought processes and actual utterances are completely identical\" and because of this, she embodies an \"antithesis of female self-sacrifice\" in these years but also \"the opposite of the kind of hypocrisy that is typically attributed to women\". Writer Jennifer Crusie interprets this as Cordelia's \"lack of depth\" becoming \"her strength\". She does not mean to argue that Cordelia is stupid, however, pointing out \"Cordy's solipsism could easily be mistaken for stupidity, but it comes coupled with a keen intelligence and a fixity of purpose that makes her almost invincible.\" Jowett feels Cordelia's confidence is based in her wealth. Despite becoming more sympathetic as the series progressed, \"bitchiness enhances Cordelia's comic appeal\", as it offers viewers an opportunity to relish its honest truth-telling.\n\n\n=== Development ===\nIn early seasons of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Cordelia was often used both as comic relief and occasionally for the damsel in distress plot device, which would require series' heroine Buffy to save her. Any concerns that she was simply one-dimensional were alleviated for the actress when writers developed the character through her relationships with Xander and later Wesley, which led Carpenter to become more convinced of her potential. In an article about the psychology of characters in Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Steven C. Schlozman writes about how \"Cordelia is wealthy and, at first glance, superficial, appearing to care most about her own popularity. However, as the show progresses, we learn that her mother suffers from chronic fatigue syndrome and her father was prosecuted for income tax evasion. She is a reluctant participant, baffled at her own loyal feelings and bewildered at her attraction to the unpopular Xander.\" He goes on to describe how Cordelia, and \"all the characters of Buffy the Vampire Slayer are particularly compelling for their depictions of important adolescent themes.\"\nDiscussing Cordelia's relationship with Xander, Carpenter says, \"A lot of Cordy's conflict, and a lot of who she is, comes out around Xander. Because she is in love with him in spite of herself, or in spite of him. I have my best moments with [Nicholas Brendon].\" However, her character's growing involvement with Buffy and her friends caused the actress some concern; \"I wasn't sure how I felt about it, because I didn't want to lose my edge. I didn't want her to be nice; I didn't want her to change because that's who she is.\" Carpenter's challenge was to find a balance between the good and bad sides of Cordelia, and she explains, \"That's why I enjoy playing her so much. She's got to be somewhat tolerable or why would they hang out with her? But I [try] not to lose her edge, her honesty.\" Carpenter claims that Cordelia's \"rough edges\" made for difficult experiences with fans, who expected her to be snobby like her character. Charisma continually pleaded to get to slay a vampire, which the writers let her do in her final Buffy appearance, \"Graduation Day, Part Two\".\nOver the course of her appearances in Angel, Cordelia would develop enormously as a character. Describing this evolution, Carpenter comments, \"When I first started playing Cordelia, she wasn't nice. She has really deepened and has a stronger sense of responsibility. She's a team player, which was not the case in the beginning.\" Carpenter cherishes what playing a multi-faceted character like Cordelia meant for her as an actress, describing The road Cordelia has traveled, the journey she has taken up to now has been such a joy to play as an actress, because there have been so many chances to do so many different emotions. Heroic, vulnerable, just angry, possessed, funny \u2013 I get to be all those different things rolled into one. Getting this role, in hindsight... God I made a good decision, or they did. Cultural critic Jennifer Crusie points out how Cordelia was initially perfect for the transition to \"selfish, superficial Los Angeles\", which turned out to be her \"trial by fire\".Executive producer David Greenwalt was very keen to acquire the character of Cordelia for the spin-off series, commenting, \"I desperately wanted her to come to Angel because Angel being dark and broody, we need a big bright smile.\" At the same time, Whedon felt her presence was sorely missed in the fourth season of Buffy where \"All of our characters got to the point where they were loving and hugging, and it was sort of like, where's Cordelia?\", leading him to introduce Spike (James Marsters) to the cast to accommodate her absence. Kelly A. Manners describes Cordelia as a \"rich gal whose family ended up losing everything to the IRS. So in episode one of Angel, Cordelia showed up in LA trying to start a career as an actress because her family was in jail, actually.\" Crusie states that in mourning for Doyle Cordelia also begins \"finding within herself a new level of humanity\".\nGreenwalt discusses how Cordelia \"is sort of forced to become a deeper character\" when she starts to receive the visions of the suffering and helpless, \"She's sort of living with one foot in the world of 'I want to be an actress' and with another foot in the world of 'I want to save and help people, and I have a deeper purpose and mission.'\" Greenwalt felt that this development allowed Cordelia to develop from a \"vainglorious high schooler to someone who's almost like a superhero\"; this also provided Carpenter with the opportunity to stretch her potential as an actress. From the tenth episode, \"Parting Gifts\", Cordelia begins to actively function as a supernatural character in the series while the introduction of Wesley also contributes some added comic relief to the series. It is from this episode Cordelia is also forced to mature as she mourns the death of Doyle, whose visions serve as a painful reminder of him. The first-season finale saw Cordelia's visions inflict all the suffering of the human world upon her, and to effectively act this, Carpenter's acting coach showed her pictures of real human pain as motivation. The scene took over eight hours to film, and Carpenter was relieved when it was over. The experience saw Cordelia further resolve to help those in need, stating \"I saw the world and there's so much pain. We have to help them.\" Carpenter explains, \"Through the suffering of the world, and through her own experiences, she discovers what's important in life.\"Carpenter pleaded to the producers to let her cut her hair in the second season of Angel, but they were dissatisfied with the darker tone and cut which created a \"dark edge of Cordelia\" which wasn't as \"warm and effervescent as she usually is\", so for the third season they wanted her to \"go shorter and blonder\". Angel's third season demonstrates Cordelia's development into a full-fledged heroine. The episode \"Birthday\" saw her being offered the chance to live a life where she never met Angel, but her inner desire to help others sees her sacrifice this life and her humanity to become a half-demon who can better withstand the visions she carries. In \"Billy\", Cordelia begins to train alongside Angel to become a better fighter and learns quickly. Carpenter began to train extensively with the show's stunt co-ordinators both to learn how to fight and to handle weaponry. In the episode \"Waiting in the Wings\", both Angel and Lorne remark on what a fine woman Cordelia has finally become, with Cordelia noting she is more like a superhero than she ever expected to be growing up in Sunnydale. Also in this episode, she and Angel both realize they have fallen for one another, but their love goes unconsummated. Critically, Jennifer Crusie considers Cordelia's ascension to the heavens at the end of season three to be the \"point that the Mutant Enemy Productions writers evidently lost their minds\". She goes on to describe how Cordelia's compliance with Skip seems entirely out of character. Jes Battis also argues that a paradox is created when \"the character who embraces her privilege (Cordelia) gets to become a higher being and exit Angel, and as an overwhelmingly positive force\" where later Fred (Amy Acker), \"the character who is conflicted about her privilege\" in season five \"ends up being possessed by a millennia-old demon\".\nAngel season four played with audience's expectations of the now heroic Cordelia by revealing her to be the season's Big Bad; it was later established that Cordelia had been possessed by a manipulative deity called Jasmine. The storyline was controversial with fans, and Carpenter has admitted hating how a possessed Cordelia seduced Angel's teenage son. Carpenter has said, \"I'm in denial about that whole storyline. It was creepy.\" She tried to keep a positive attitude about the situation, though;  director Terrence O'Hara commented that he thought Carpenter had \"a lot of fun\" playing a manipulative Cordelia in the episode \"Orpheus\" because she enjoyed coming up with Cordelia's new \"schizophrenic madwoman\" characterization. David Boreanaz was also unsettled by the incestuous pairing. At a  2004 convention, he admitted that the season four storyline \"freaked him out.\" The episode \"Inside Out\" saw the height of this inversion of Cordelia's character, where she is seen urging Connor to murder an innocent girl in order to expedite the birth of the child they conceived together. In an effort to stop Connor, the Powers That Be send the spirit of Connor's mother Darla (Julie Benz) to convince him not to go through with it. The episode sees Carpenter dressed in black, while Benz appears in heavenly white as she becomes the voice of reason and morality. Steven S. DeKnight, who wrote and directed the episode, felt this was a brilliant role-reversal for both actresses as Carpenter is accustomed to playing the benevolent Cordelia where Darla is normally seen as a sinister vampire. Much of season four's storyline had to be adjusted due to Carpenter's real-life pregnancy; after Cordelia gives birth to Jasmine in the episode \"Inside Out\" she is left in a coma for the remainder of the fourth season. Crusie discusses what she felt were the flaws in the execution of the fourth season, It's that she betrays the man she trusts above all others and who trusts her absolutely; it's that she seduces a boy she once diapered; it's that she dresses like a drag queen and talks like a Dynasty reject. It's that she's not Cordy, and what might have been fun to watch had we been let into the secret before the Beastmaster seduced Connor becomes the extended rape and death of a much-beloved character.\nMatt Hills and Rebecca Williams also discuss the treatment of Cordelia (and Darla) in \"Angel's Monstrous Mothers and Vampires with Soul: Investigating the Abject in 'Television Horror'\", from Reading Angel: The TV Spin-off With a Soul by Stacey Abbot. They see the send-offs of Cordelia, Fred and other characters as part of a pattern of highly gendered \"elaborated abjection\" seen in Angel. They also see Cordelia's possession in season four as part of a recurring pattern: \"More so than other characters in [Buffy] and Angel, Cordelia has suffered or been threatened with bodily invasion and rape, either symbolically or literally\" and recounts the demon impregnation in \"Expecting\", and similarly in \"Epiphany\", where she develops a gestating demon in her head and then told she must mate with the Groosalugg in \"Through the Looking Glass\". Cordelia even remarks on this, as Hills and Williams quote her as she remarks on her \"status as a violated and devalued character\"; Cordelia states, \"If you ever figure out how to get us out of here, I want you to find me a dimension where some demon doesn't want to impregnate me with his spawn!\" They liken the horror motif in these examples, and in \"Inside Out\", to what Barbara Creed called the 'monstrous womb' in her book The Monstrous-feminine: Film, Feminism, Psychoanalysis. Jes Battis also comments how, in comparison with the Fred-Illyria season five storyline, Cordelia's storyline is not as positive as Fred's rebirth, because Fred got to \"'live on' through Illyria, whereas Cordelia is taken right out of the show and receives no interesting blue-haired reincarnation\". Continuing, they say that in fact, there is no meaningful connection between the \"real\" Cordelia and Jasmine, as the Cordelia who did those bad things is killed the moment Jasmine is, \"and the 'true' Cordy wakes up from her coma\". Further illustrating the comparisons, \"Fred/Illyria become a joined mother/daughter subjectivity, a dual being whose constituent essences are inseparable; Cordelia is never so intimately connected with her evil child and is remembered as the healthy, vibrant Cordy that everyone knew.\" Pointing out symbolic parallels in the subtexts of these gestations, Battis notes Cordelia, a vocal advocate of her own privilege, creates a fully formed supernatural being, Jasmine, who attempts (shockingly) to control the world. Fred, on the other hand, who internalizes her own privilege and cannot express it except in terms of insecurity and awkwardness, has her body devoured from the inside by the demon Illyria.\nFor Angel's fifth season, as with Buffy's fourth, Spike steps in to replace Cordelia as a source of comedic dialogue within the series. It is also noted by critics that, in the fifth season, \"it doesn't take long for Illyria to become a version of Cordelia, giving everyone the cold and honest truth whether they want it or not\". Concerning Cordelia's last appearance in Angel's fifth and final season, Joss Whedon says he used the 100th episode to reinforce the \"mission statement\" of the show, as well as assess where the characters are now compared to how they began. Whedon explains this episode presents an ideal opportunity to\u2014through Cordelia, who was \"there at the beginning\"\u2014ask of Angel, \"Where are you now? Where were you when you started and where are you now and how do you feel about that?\" The return to the show's \"original concerns\" is echoed by the flashback to Doyle's first season advertisement; Sara Upstone points out aerial images of Los Angeles reappear at the same time Cordelia tells Angel \"You forgot who you are,\" bringing back the show's link to the city. Buffy Summers was originally intended to appear in the 100th episode to get Angel 'back on track', but Sarah Michelle Gellar had other obligations. Writer/director David Fury explains that since \"we couldn't get Sarah\" the episode was instead written for Cordelia. He adds, \"This turned out to be a Godsend because Charisma was fantastic.\" In the original script, Fury wrote a conversation between Wesley and Angel while driving to the hospital that set up Cordelia as a possible vegetable. The scene was never shot because \"the shock of seeing her up and around after a 9-month coma was enough. We just didn't want to tip it too soon,\" says Fury.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nFor her role as Cordelia Chase, as she appeared in the television series Angel, Charisma Carpenter has been nominated four times by the Saturn Awards. Carpenter earned back-to-back nominations in 2000 and 2001 for Best Genre TV Supporting Actress and Best Actress on Television, respectively. The actress did not receive any nominations in 2002, but again obtained two back-to-back nominations in 2003 and 2004 for Best Actress in a Television Series and Best Supporting Actress in a Television Series, respectively.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nCordelia Chase on IMDb", "infobox": {"color": "#7E9ED2", "name": "Cordelia Chase", "series": "[[Buffyverse|Buffy the Vampire Slayer / Angel]]", "image": "CordeliaChase.jpg", "caption": "[[Charisma Carpenter]] as Cordelia", "first": "\"[[Welcome to the Hellmouth]]\" (1997)", "last": "\"[[After These Messages...

A doll with a rough, antagonistic personality and an independent, anarchist behaviour, Em\u00edlia is Lobato's most popular creation alongside Jeca Tatu and, according to studies and analyses of his work, she is his personification in the stories and that, towards the character, Lobato expresses his own ideas. Even though, Lobato has stated that Em\u00edlia is \"sometimes so independent that neither I, nor her father, succeed in controlling her\".\nSince 1951, Em\u00edlia has been adapted to stage plays, theatrical films and television series, portrayed by several actresses (twelve altogether) throughout the decades in Brazil.\n\n\n== History ==\nEm\u00edlia is a rag doll described as \"clumsy\" or \"ugly\", resembling a \"witch\" that was handmade by Aunt Nast\u00e1cia, the ranch's cook, for the little girl L\u00facia, also known as \"Little Nose\". Some day, while at the creek of a nearby stream, Lucia fell asleep and was supposedly (as the narrative initially suggests the girl could be dreaming) awaken by a tiny fish and his friend, a cockchafer, while they talked to each other on her upturned nose. The two of them were flung afar after L\u00facia sneezed because of their presence. Thinking that L\u00facia was a monster, the bug left, but the fish (dressed in suit and tie), stood, and introduced himself as the Scaly Prince from the Clear Waters Kingdom. L\u00facia introduced herself and a still inanimate Em\u00edlia, and both were invited to visit the Prince's underwater kingdom. L\u00facia then discovered that the stream was a portal to a woundrous place full of other talking fishes and insects. As the frog guard, Major Sticky, was found sleeping at the Palace's gateway, the Prince suggested L\u00facia to dress him with Em\u00edlia's skirt, and obligated him to eat several sea rocks as a punishment for sleeping while working. At the dinner, L\u00facia first met Doctor Snail, and complained about Em\u00edlia's current situation. The Doctor then medicated the doll with a dose of his pills (the same Major Sticky later accidentally ingested, mistaking them with sea rocks), and Em\u00edlia suddenly started talking, and would never stop henceforth. She immediately nominated herself as the \"Marchioness of Rabic\u00f3\", the \"Countess of Three Tiny Stars\". L\u00facia then was forced to go back to surface as Aunt Nast\u00e1cia screamed loud enough to shake the bottom of the sea.\nL\u00facia arrived home surprising her tender grandmother, Mrs. Benta, and scaring Aunt Nast\u00e1cia, with her brand-new, talkative and living Em\u00edlia. Later, Em\u00edlia met L\u00facia's cousin that arrived from town, Pedrinho.\nEm\u00edlia's position as the \"Marchioness of Rabic\u00f3\" makes L\u00facia have the idea of promoting a royal engagement between the doll and the greezy, fat and lazy pig of the same name, starting to treat her as an actual marchioness and bride. Em\u00edlia believes when L\u00facia tells her that the pig had been a charming prince one day, before an evil fairy cursed him. The doll decides she will accept the pig's \"proposal\", even though she won't live with Rabic\u00f3 until he turns back to normal. L\u00facia suggested the creation of a nearby \"royal\" figure. Primally using a corn cob, Pedrinho then created the \"Viscount of Sabugosa\", which in an unknown form came to life and, beyond the wedding prank, would become Em\u00edlia's counterpart to the boy. Believing in everything, Em\u00edlia was then \"married\" to Rabic\u00f3, for L\u00facia and Pedrinho's delight, but was led to a disastrous after-party when the pig attacked the homemade candies, for Em\u00edlia's disgust. The doll fainted after Pedrinho revealed her the truth about Rabic\u00f3's \"curse\". At a dinner, Em\u00edlia roughly celebrated as everybody thought Aunt Nast\u00e1cia had roasted her husband, for L\u00facia's despair.\n\nThis time with Rabic\u00f3, the Viscount and Pedrinho, L\u00facia and Em\u00edlia returned to the Underwater Kingdom as L\u00facia receives a letter from the fishes, stating that the Prince, after her sudden departure, was left in sadness. At the Kingdom, for everyone's surprise, the Viscount reveals himself to have the mind of an intellectual biologist. He and his people, for Em\u00edlia's delight, are invited by Narizinho to visit their ranch. Em\u00edlia insists to Mrs. Benta to exchange one of the cows for a whale from the Kingdom. As one of the guests, Miss Sardine (a pilchard), gets fried after she confuses Aunt Nast\u00e1cia's boiling oil with a swimming pool, the Prince and his subjects decide to leave the Yellow Woodpecker Ranch. However, L\u00facia had yet no rescue the Prince, as he had \"unlearned the art of swimming\" after too much time away from the water.\nEm\u00edlia creates dissension with who appears to be Felix the Cat, after he arrives in the rach with \"gawky\" stories (all of them contradicted by the Viscount). She is decided to think of a tale better than the one told by Felix the night before, and succeeds, as everybody applauses her, leaving the Cat jealous. After one of the fowls is killed and devoured, the Viscount starts a Sherlock Holmes-like investigation, and the Cat, which in fact is not Felix, is expelled by Aunt Nast\u00e1cia.\n\nIn the most original volume of the series, A Chave do Tamanho (\"The Size Key\"), Em\u00edlia commits her greatest act, after noticing that the horror of World War II is causing pain in everyone, particularly Mrs. Benta, and filling the ranch with sadness. Traveling by the magical powder of Pirlimpimpim, Em\u00edlia visits a house where are placed the Keys that can turn on and turn off the impossible to the most unimaginable things. Attempting to turn down the Key of War, Em\u00edlia chooses the wrong one, and turns down the Key that controls the size equilibrium of every human being. Em\u00edlia founds herself hundreds of times smaller, among her dress, and later finds out that she caused the same to happen with the whole humanity. The doll becomes smaller enough to settle her own \"ranch\" on the Viscount's topper. As the small people become used to their new life, Em\u00edlia manages to visit the White House, where she interacts with the President of the United States and questions him about the War. After realizing that the Size was \"evil\" since the scarcity from before the shrinkage have been replaced by abundance, Em\u00edlia proposes a referendum, so people will vote either for or against the Size. After everyone agrees to return to their normal size, Em\u00edlia takes the Viscount to the House of Keys, where he turns the Size on once again.\nOther occasion was the literal reform the doll proposed to the whole nature, which ended up with earthworms, insects such like ants and centipedes, as well as microscopic beings such as fleas, having their sizes increased to the proportion of a dog (the opposite to what happened in A Chave do Tamanho).\n\n\n== Tie-ins ==\nEm\u00edlia, alongside the Viscount and Mrs. Benta, in featured in a tie-in biographical novel written by Brazilian author Luciana Sandrini, Minhas Mem\u00f3rias de Lobato (\"My Lobato Memories\"). The story is similar to Mem\u00f3rias de Em\u00edlia, but in Minhas Mem\u00f3rias, the doll decides to write about her creator, once again with the \"help\" of the Viscount. Mrs. Benta then tells them his story, detailing his entire life, from childhood to his final years.\nAuthor Moacyr Scliar has a short story, Por Onde Anda Em\u00edlia\"? (literally \"Whatever Happened to Emilia?\"), in which he suggests the fates of the doll and her family after several years have passed. While Mrs. Benta and Aunt Nast\u00e1cia had died, Rabic\u00f3 had been turned into ham after all, and Pedrinho and L\u00facia became adults and \"vanished\", an aged Em\u00edlia was still alive and defiant as always, dreaming about switching off the keys of Poverty, Unemployment and Hunger (Brazilian social issues of the present day), and about the Yellow Woodpecker farm itself, their former world of fantasy now possessed by homeless invaders (a reference to the MST). Having a conservative and an anarchist side, Emilia demonstrates being dubious over the movement, divided between adhering and rebelling, while the most recommended person to advise her, her own creator, has already died.\n\n\n== Personality ==\nEm\u00edlia develops from an ordinary rag doll to an \"almost human\" doll, as she demonstrates to be abnormally intelligent by insisting on her own ideologies and opinions, even though she insists to pronounce many words in the wrong way, or on her own way. For example, she prefers to say \"liscab\u00e3o\" rather than \"belisc\u00e3o\" (\"pinch\"), and insisted to refer to Doctor Snail as Doctor \"Cara-de-coruja\" (which is assonant to \"caramujo\", which is one word for \"snail\" in Portuguese).\nAccording to herself, Em\u00edlia is \"Independ\u00eancia ou Morte!\", a catchphrase she took from Prince Pedro I, who proclaimed the Independence of Brazil. Em\u00edlia has proven herself to be rogue, rebellious, stubborn, rough and intensely determined. In Hist\u00f3rias Diversas, she attempts to take a group of nymphs to her own by tricking their leader. She also was decided to cut off the wings of a little angel in Mem\u00f3rias de Em\u00edlia, but fails as the angel manage to escape.\n\n\n=== Controversy ===\nMonteiro Lobato has been criticized for his racist portrayal and treatment of black people in several of his works. This can be noticed in the way Em\u00edlia refers to Aunt Nast\u00e1cia (a mulatta), or the way she treats the cook. With the S\u00edtio do Picapau Amarelo novel series, this has been analysed in the way he depicts Aunt Nast\u00e1cia. In Peter Pan, while Mrs. Benta tells J. M. Berry's novel to her grandsons, Aunt Nast\u00e1cia complains about \"missing pieces\" of her own shadow. It is later revealed by the Viscount that Em\u00edlia was, literally, cutting of the woman's shadow with a scissor, leaving everyone to what the doll simply smiled with superiority, after spending a considerable part of the novel questioning about Nast\u00e1cia's beliefs and her color.\n\n\n== In other media ==\nEm\u00edlia's behaviour and physical aspect are intensely softened when the character is adapted into live-action portrayal. A magical subplot was added to the Rede Globo version of the character as, in their version, Em\u00edlia is able to bring imagination to real only by \"pretending\". Her ability is constantly desired by the story's antagonists, primally the reptilian evil hag Cuca.\n\n\n=== Film and television ===\nEm\u00edlia was portrayed for the first time in the 1951 feature film O Saci, directed by Rodolfo Nanni, based on the novel of the same name, the second volume of the series. Child actress Olga Maria plays the doll in the movie.\nIn the following year, she was portrayed by an adult actress, and so would be for the next fifty years. L\u00facia Lambertini was cast as Em\u00edlia in the first television series based on the S\u00edtio novels, produced by TV Tupi. On two occasions, when Lambertini got married and later pregnant, she was replaced by Dulce Margarida. The two actresses then started portraying the doll mutually, after Lambertini left S\u00e3o Paulo to continue acting as Em\u00edlia in Rio de Janeiro.\nZodja Pereira took the part in the 1967 Rede Bandeirantes' series.\nA second theatrical film, released in 1973, had Leda Zepellin in the role, directed by Geraldo Sarno.\nThe most famous portrayal of Em\u00edlia, as a colorful rag doll with a trademark make-up and patchwork hair, would start in 1977, after actress Dirce Migliaccio was cast as Em\u00edlia for the first Rede Globo series S\u00edtio do Picapau Amarelo, that is now considered a classic. In 1978, Migliaccio was replaced by Reny de Oliveira, who left the series in 1982 after not having a positive feedback from the character. Oliveira is notorious for posing nude for Playboy Brasil in order to rid her image from Em\u00edlia. Suzana Abranches then assumed her place between 1983 and 1986, when the show was then cancelled.\nS\u00edtio do Picapau Amarelo would come back fourteen years later, in 2001, with Isabelle Drummond in the role. Drummond was supposed to read for the part of L\u00facia, but choose to read Em\u00edlia's by herself, being cast at the age of 8. The role debuted her career and became strongly popular in the following years.  A Rede Globo television special presented by Drummond as Em\u00edlia, in 2004, featured a scene where the doll encountered Dirce Migliaccio's character when looking through a mirror, seeing Dirce's Em\u00edlia as her reflection. In another television special to celebrate Rede Globo's 40th anniversary, Isabelle Drummond (as a girl thar grew up watching the network) was digitally inserted in several programs of Globo, including past versions of S\u00edtio. The actress left the series in 2006.\nTatyane Goulart replaced Isabelle Drummond in 2007, the final year of the show after its 2001 revival. S\u00edtio was cancelled due to poor ratings in that year.\nIn 2012, the 2001 version of S\u00edtio, as well as the novel Reina\u00e7\u00f5es de Narizinho, served as the basis for an animated series of same name, which is produced by Globo and Mixer. Isabella Guarnieri voices Em\u00edlia in the episodes.\n\n\n=== Comics ===\nS\u00edtio do Picapau Amarelo became a comic in 1977, published by RGE. The characters later received their own titles, including the doll, with Em\u00edlia which was published between 1979 and 1980 earning 6 issues.The 2001 series was brought into the comic book format in 2003, for the national Brazilian anti-hunger campaign Fome Zero, entitled Em\u00edlia e a Turma do S\u00edtio no Fome Zero. The series generally dealt with nutritional reeducation. Between 2006 and 2008 there was a little return of the S\u00edtio do Picapau Amarelo comics, published by Editora Globo.

Primarily an ally of superhero Black Panther, the character exists within Marvel's main shared universe, known as the Marvel Universe.\nMartin Freeman portrays the character in the Marvel Cinematic Universe films Captain America: Civil War (2016), Black Panther (2018), the upcoming Black Panther: Wakanda Forever (2022) and the upcoming Disney+ series Secret Invasion (2022).\n\n\n== Publication history ==\nEverett Ross debuted in Ka-Zar Vol. 3, #17, and was created by Christopher Priest and Kenny Martinez. Afterward, Ross went on to be a major character in Black Panther Vol. 3, #1-32, #34-35, #38-49, #57-58, and #62. Ross subsequently appeared in issues #1-2, #4-6, #16, #19, #21-24, #26, and #37 of Black Panther Vol. 4, and issue #7 of Black Panther Vol. 5. Outside of Black Panther, Ross had a guest role in The Uncanny X-Men Vol. 1, #387.\nAccording to creator Christopher Priest, Ross's personality was based on that of Chandler Bing, a character from the television series Friends, while the name was inspired by the Family Ties character Alex P. Keaton. After introducing Ross in Ka-Zar, Priest chose to bring the character back in Black Panther for use as an audience surrogate who \"saw Panther the way Panther had ultimately come to be seen by Marvel: Just Some Guy who was routinely overshadowed by heroes in which they were more invested\".Priest further elaborated, \"Comics are traditionally created by white males for white males. I figured, and I believe rightly, that for Black Panther to succeed, it needed a white male at the center, and that white male had to give voice to the audience's misgivings or apprehensions or assumptions about this character and this book. Ross needed to be un-PC to the point of being borderline racist\"; and clarified, \"I don't think Ross was racist at all. I just think that his stream-of-conscious narrative is a window into things I imagine many whites say or at least think when no blacks are around; myths about black culture and behavior. I was also introducing a paradigm shift to the way Panther was to be portrayed; somebody had to give voice to the expectation of a dull and colorless character who always got his butt kicked or who was overshadowed by Thor and Iron Man suddenly knocking out Mephisto with one punch\".\n\n\n== Fictional character biography ==\nEverett Ross was a US State Department employee, whose job was to escort foreign diplomats on American soil. As a child, Ross was not well adjusted. Obese and unloved by his mother, he was constantly bullied with his most embarrassing memory being beaten up by a girl named Natalie McPhail. He eventually left home and turned his life around by working for the government. His world changed forever when he was assigned to T'Challa, the Black Panther and ruler of Wakanda.\nEverett and T'Challa faced multiple threats to Wakanda's sovereignty. Ross assists him in many of these threats. In gratitude, the Panther often risks much for Ross in return. The first threat he and Ross encounter is 'Xcon', an alliance of rogue intelligence agents backing a coup led by the Reverend Achebe.As an expert on Wakanda, Ross worked as an adviser alongside government officials and the National Security Agency. He was part of a meeting at the White House about Wakanda.Ross subsequently acts as a liaison for Shuri, the younger sister of Black Panther, during Shuri's first goodwill visit to the United States. When their convoy is attacked by assassins, Shuri saves Ross's life.The World Security Council later selects Ross to prosecute the tribunal of S.H.I.E.L.D. director Maria Hill.\n\n\n== Other versions ==\nIn an alternate future seen in the Black Panther storyline \"The Once and Future King\", an elderly Ross is abducted by a cabal of villains assembled by T'Charra, who intends to use Ross as the bait in his plan to kill and usurp Black Panther. Ross is rescued by Black Panther, who he in turn saves when Black Panther suffers a heart attack, resuscitating the hero while screaming, \"Your majesty\u2014come back\u2014blast you, T'Challa\u2014we've been through too much!!\"During the \"Rising Storm!\" story-arc of the series X-Men Forever, a version of Ross appears on Earth-161. After Storm is outed as a murderer and an ally of a criminal organization called the Consortium, she flees to and is given sanctuary by Wakanda, to the consternation of Ross. Ross subsequently appears on behalf of the President of the United States at both the United Nations (where he warns the other representatives about the threat posed by Storm's takeover of Wakanda) and a meeting with the heads of Genosha and S.H.I.E.L.D.\n\n\n== In other media ==\n\n\n=== Television ===\nEverett Ross appears in the 2010 Black Panther animated series, voiced by David Busch.\n\n\n=== Marvel Cinematic Universe ===\n\nMartin Freeman portrays Everett Ross in live-action films set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. This version was a member of the United States Air Force before joining the CIA.\n\nEverett is introduced in Captain America: Civil War, as the Deputy Task Force Commander of the Joint Counterterrorism Center and reports to Secretary of State Thaddeus Ross. During this time, Everett works with Tony Stark's faction of the Avengers and attempts to apprehend Bucky Barnes, who was framed for bombing the Vienna International Centre. Later, Everett supervises the incarceration of the real culprit, Helmut Zemo, after he is captured by T'Challa.\nIn Black Panther, Everett runs into T'Challa during a black market arms sale in Busan, South Korea, and is injured while protecting Nakia, prompting T'Challa to take Everett to Wakanda for treatment despite the country's policies against outsiders. In return, Everett briefs T'Challa and his family on the history of Erik \"Killmonger\" Stevens, a former American Black Ops operative who they later discover is T'Challa's cousin. Everett joins Shuri, Ramonda, and Nakia in escaping to the Wakandan mountains to visit the Jabari tribe, where they find and heal a wounded T'Challa, who Killmonger defeated in combat. With Shuri's assistance, Everett also helps prevent Vibranium weapons from being taken out of Wakanda. Later, Everett attends a United Nations summit in Austria where T'Challa publicly pledges Wakanda's diplomatic and humanitarian assistance to the world.\nEverett will return in Secret Invasion.\nEverett will return in Black Panther: Wakanda Forever.\n\n\n=== Video games ===\nEverett K.

Wang was the second female taikonaut selected to the People's Liberation Army Astronaut Corps, the second Chinese woman in space, and the first Chinese woman to perform a spacewalk.In 2022, with a cumulative 197 days in space, she set a new record for longest stay in space by a Chinese astronaut.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nWang was born in the prefecture of Yantai, in Shandong province. Her mother and father are farmers, and she was reported to have two sisters.\n\n\n== Career ==\nIn September 1991, she entered junior high school in Yantai, and in 1994 entered Yantai Yizhong High School, graduating in 1997. She was admitted to the Changchun Flight College of the People's Liberation Army Air Force and joined the force in August 1997. Wang was from the seventh batch of female military pilots in China, one of 37 members, and graduated from Aviation University and flight school in 2001 with the rank of First Lieutenant. As a pilot with the Air Force's transport aircraft crew in Wuhan, she has participated in tasks such as combat readiness exercises, the Wenchuan Earthquake relief effort, and cloud seeding and weather modification for the Beijing 2008 Olympic Games to eliminate clouds and reduce rain. After accumulating safe flights for 1600 hours, she was named Air Force Class II pilot. In May 2010 she officially became the second female astronaut of China. At that time Wang was a captain in the People's Liberation Army Air Force.She was a candidate for the space mission Shenzhou 9 in 2012. However, Liu Yang was selected over her for the historic mission of the first Chinese female space traveller. Wang was a member of the backup crew for SZ-9.Wang became the second Chinese female spacefarer as a member of the Shenzhou 10 spaceship crew, which orbited the Earth in June 2013, and of the Tiangong-1 orbiting space station with which it docked. She was known as the \u201cGoddess II\u201d. She was the first member of the crew announced, in April, while the remainder of the crew were announced in June. Wang Yaping was one of two women in space on the 50th anniversary of Vostok 6, the first spaceflight by a woman, Valentina Tereshkova. The other woman in space on 16 June 2013 was Karen Nyberg, an American astronaut aboard the International Space Station. While aboard Tiangong-1, Wang conducted scientific experiments and taught a physics lesson to Chinese students by live television broadcast. In 2018, she held the rank of Air Force Colonel, and had trained to fly four aircraft models.In March 2018, Wang was elected for a five-year-term as a deputy to the National People's Congress.In October 2021, it was announced that Wang was selected as one of the three crew members to fly on Shenzhou 13 to the Tiangong space station, marking her second spaceflight and the first time a Chinese woman would travel to space twice. She was to be the first female astronaut to board the Tiangong space station and to perform an extravehicular activity. The mission would be China's longest crewed space mission.\nOn 15 October 2021, the three Shenzhou 13 crewmembers arrived at the Tianhe space station module, hours after launch. On 7 November, the China Manned Space Agency announced that a spacewalk was underway and it was being performed by astronauts Zhai Zhigang, the Shenzhou 13 mission commander, and Wang Yaping, who was now China's first female spacewalker. EVA operations started at 6:21 p.m.. Wang exited from the node cabin of the Tianhe Core Module at 8:28 p.m.. Zhai and Wang completed their EVAs and returned to Tianhe by 1:16 a.m. on 8 November, the entire operation having lasted 6 hours and 25 minutes.

Lawrence", "url_name": "614994", "txt": "Wendy Barrien Lawrence (born July 2, 1959) is a retired United States Navy Captain, an engineer, and former helicopter pilot and NASA astronaut. She was the first female graduate of the United States Naval Academy to fly into space and she has also visited the Russian Space Station Mir. She was a mission specialist on STS-114, the first Space Shuttle flight after the Space Shuttle Columbia disaster. She is married to Cathy Watson, a former NASA scientist.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nLawrence was born in Jacksonville, Florida. She is the daughter and the granddaughter of naval aviators; her grandfather was noted student-athlete Fatty Lawrence and her father was the late Vice Admiral William P. Lawrence, a Mercury astronaut finalist and a former Vietnam prisoner of war who was Superintendent of the U.S. Naval Academy during her last three years as a midshipman and the person for whom the destroyer USS William P. Lawrence (DDG-110) is named.\n\n\n== Education ==\nLawrence graduated from Fort Hunt High School in Alexandria, Virginia in 1977. She went on to attend the U.S. Naval Academy, graduating in 1981 with a Bachelor of Science in Ocean Engineering. She later earned a Master of Science in Ocean Engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in 1988, as part of a joint program between the two schools.\n\n\n== Organizations ==\nLarwance Heights Middle School\nPhi Kappa Phi\nAssociation of Naval Aviation\nWomen Military Aviators\nNaval Helicopter Association\nThe Mars Generation\n\n\n== Military career ==\nLawrence graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy in 1981. A distinguished flight school graduate, she was designated as a Naval Aviator in July 1982. Lawrence has more than 1,500 hours of flight time in six different types of helicopters and has made more than 800 shipboard landings. While assigned to Helicopter Combat Support Squadron 6 (HC-6), she was one of the first two female helicopter pilots to make a long deployment to the Indian Ocean as part of a carrier battle group. After completion of a master's degree program at MIT and Woods Hole in 1988, she was assigned to Helicopter Anti-Submarine Squadron Light 30 (HSL-30) as Officer-in-charge of Detachment Alpha. In October 1990, Lawrence reported to the U.S. Naval Academy where she served as a physics instructor and the novice women's crew coach.\n\n\n== NASA career ==\n\nSelected by NASA in March 1992, Lawrence reported to the Johnson Space Center in August 1992. She completed one year of training and was qualified for flight assignment as a Mission Specialist. Her technical assignments within the Astronaut Office have included flight software verification in the Shuttle Avionics Integration Laboratory (SAIL), Astronaut Office Assistant Training Officer, and Astronaut Office representative for Space Station training and crew support. She flew as the ascent/entry flight engineer and blue shift orbit pilot on STS-67 (March 2\u201318, 1995). She next served as Director of Operations for NASA at the Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Center in Star City, Russia, with responsibility for the coordination and implementation of mission operations activities in the Moscow region for the joint U.S./Russian Shuttle/Mir program. In September 1996 she began training as a crew member for a 4-month mission on the Russian Space Station Mir. However, she was replaced by David Wolf due to concerns over minimum size requirements for the Russian Orlan EVA suit. Because of her knowledge and experience with Mir systems and with crew transfer logistics for the Mir, she flew on STS-86 (September 25 to October 6, 1997) and STS-91 (June 2\u201312, 1998). A veteran of four space flights, she logged over 1,200 hours in space. Lawrence was a Mission Specialist on the crew of STS-114. She was in charge of the transfer of supplies and equipment and operated the Space Station robotic arm on the Return To Flight mission during which the crew tested and evaluated new procedures for the inspection and repair of the Space Shuttle thermal protection system. The mission launched on July 26, 2005, and landed on August 9, 2005.\n\nCaptain Lawrence retired from NASA in June 2006.\n\n\n=== Spaceflight experience ===\n\nSTS-67 Endeavour (March 2\u201318, 1995) was the second flight of the ASTRO observatory, a unique complement of three telescopes. During this 16-day mission, the crew conducted observations around the clock to study the far ultraviolet spectra of faint astronomical objects and the polarization of ultraviolet light coming from hot stars and distant galaxies. Mission duration was 399 hours and 9 minutes.STS-86 Atlantis (September 25 to October 6, 1997) was the seventh mission to rendezvous and dock with the Russian Space Station Mir. Highlights included the exchange of U.S. crew members Mike Foale and David Wolf, a spacewalk by Scott Parazynski and Vladimir Titov to retrieve four experiments first deployed on Mir during the STS-76 docking mission, the transfer to Mir of 10,400 pounds of science and logistics, and the return of experiment hardware and results to Earth. Mission duration was 169 orbits in 259 hours and 21 minutes.STS-91 Discovery (June 2\u201312, 1998) was the 9th and final Shuttle-Mir docking mission and marked the conclusion of the joint U.S./Russian Phase I Program. Mission duration was 235 hours, 54 minutes.STS-114 Discovery (July 26 \u2013 August 9, 2005) was the first \"Return to Flight\" mission following the Space Shuttle Columbia disaster. Highlights included the first in-flight repair to the orbiter during a spacewalk.  Mission duration was 333 hours, 33 minutes.\n\n\n== Awards and honors ==\n2019 U.S. Naval Academy Distinguished Graduate Award  (Her father was awarded this distinction in 2000).\n\n\n== See also ==\nLGBTQ Astronauts\n\n\n== External links ==\nNASA biography\n\n\n== References ==", "infobox": {"name": "Wendy B.

On August 30, 2012, Hoshide became the third Japanese astronaut to walk in space.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nHe was born in 1968 in Tokyo, Japan.He received an International Baccalaureate Diploma from the United World College of South East Asia, Singapore in 1987, a bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering from Keio University in 1992, and a Master of Science degree in aerospace engineering from the University of Houston Cullen College of Engineering in 1997.\n\n\n== Experience ==\nHoshide joined the National Space Development Agency of Japan (NASDA) in 1992 and worked in the development of the H-II launch vehicle for two years. From 1994 to 1999, he was as an astronaut support engineer for the NASDA Astronaut Office, supporting the development of the astronaut training program, and he supported astronaut Koichi Wakata during Wakata's training and mission on STS-72.\n\n\n== Astronaut career ==\n\nIn February 1999 Hoshide was selected by NASDA (now JAXA) as one of three Japanese astronaut candidates for the International Space Station (ISS). He started the ISS Astronaut Basic Training program in April 1999 and was certified as an astronaut in January 2001. Since April 2001, he has participated in ISS Advanced Training, as well as supporting the development of the hardware and operation of the Japanese Experiment Module Kib\u014d and the H-II Transfer Vehicle (HTV).\nFrom 21 July 2014 to 29 July 2014 Hoshide commanded NASA Extreme Environment Mission Operations Mission 18 (NEEMO 18) to the Aquarius Reef Base of the coast of Key Largo, Florida. He was joined by NASA astronaut Jeanette Epps and Mark Vande Hei as well as ESA astronaut Thomas Pesquet during the nine-day mission.In 2016 he served as part of the 2016 European Space Agency's Cooperative Adventure for Valuing and Exercising human behaviour and performance Skills (CAVES) expedition. Where he spent two weeks underground in caves alongside NASA astronauts Ricky Arnold and Jessica Meir, CNSA taikonaut Ye Guangfu, Roscosmos cosmonaut Sergei Korsakov and ESA astronaut Pedro Duque in order to simulate spaceflight conditions.\n\n\n=== STS-124 ===\nHoshide's first mission was as Mission Specialist onboard Space Shuttle Discovery for the STS-124 mission, which was the second of three missions to deliver the Japanese Experiment Module, nicknamed Kib\u014d, to the ISS. STS-124 launched on 31 May 2008 from the Kennedy Space Center on its mission to the space station.\nDiscovery and its crew docked to the International Space Station on 2 June 2008, beginning 8 days of operations to install the Japanese Experiment Module-Pressurised Module (JEM-PM). On Flight Day 4, NASA astronauts Mike Fossum and Ronald Garan performed a spacewalk to prepare the ISS and the JEM-PM for installation, during this Hoshide and fellow STS-124 Mission Specialist Greg Chamitoff robotically removed the module from Discovery's payload bay and moved it to its new home on the port the side of Node 2. The next day the STS-124 and Expedition 17 crews opened Kib\u014d for the first time.Hoshide and the STS-124 crew remained on the ISS until 11 June 2008, when Discovery undocked from the International Space Station and began its return to Earth, leaving Greg Chamintoff on board as a Flight Engineer on the Expedition 17 crew, and returning Expedition 17 Flight Engineer Garrett Reisman. On 14 June 2008, Discovery landed on the Shuttle Landing Facility at the Kennedy Space Center following 13 days, 18 hours, 13 minutes in space, officially ending the STS-124 mission.\n\n\n=== Expedition 32/33 ===\nIn November 2009 Hoshide was assigned to the crew of ISS Expedition 32/Expedition 33 as a Flight Engineer. He started training at the Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Center in Star City, Russia, and served on the backup crew for Expedition 30/31, which launched aboard Soyuz TMA-03M on 21 December 2011.Following the launch of Expedition 30/31, Hoshide started training for his own flight, alongside Roscosmos cosmonaut Yuri Malenchenko and NASA astronaut Sunita Williams. The trio launched onboard Soyuz TMA-05M on 15 July 2012 ahead of a two-day flight to the ISS. The three crewmembers arrived on board the ISS on 17 July 2012 and officially became members of the Expedition 32 crew, joining Russian Commander Gennady Padalka, Russian Flight Engineer Sergei Revin and NASA Flight Engineer Joe Acaba.On 27 August 2012 Hoshide robotically captured and berthed JAXA's HTV-3 uncrewed cargo spacecraft, on 30 August he ventured outside the ISS alongside Williams for his first spacewalk, over the eight hour, 17-minute spacewalk, the two astronauts prepared a Main Bus Switching Unit (MBSU) for replacement on a later spacewalk and switched some cables on the Russian Orbital Segment ahead of the launch and docking of the future Nauka laboratory module. On 5 September he and Williams went outside the station again, for a 6-hour, 28-minute spacewalk to replace the MBSU the two had prepared for replacement on the last spacewalk. They also replaced a camera on Canadarm-2.On 16 September 2012, Paldalka, Revin and Acaba departed the station onboard Soyuz TMA-04M, following which Hoshide, Williams and Malenchenko became part of the Expedition 33 crew, with Williams taking command of the station for the increment. They were later joined by Soyuz TMA-06M crewmembers Oleg Novitsky and Evgeny Tarelkin, both of Roscosmos, and NASA astronaut Kevin Ford. On 11 October 2012 Hoshide and Williams successfully robotically captured SpaceX's Cargo Dragon CRS-1 uncrewed resupply spacecraft, the first mission contracted under NASA's Commercial Resupply Services contract. On 1 November Hoshide stepped outside the station with Williams for a third time and performed a six-hour, 38-minute spacewalk to carry out several maintenance tasks on the US Orbital Segment of the station, during which Hoshide took hold of the record for most cumulative spacewalk time for a Japanese astronaut, at 21-hours and 23-minutes total.Expedition 33 officially ended on 18 November 2012 with the undocking of Soyuz TMA-05M. Malenchenko, Williams and Hoshide safely landed approximately six hours after undocking near the remote town of Arkalyk, Kazakhstan following 127 Days in space.\n\n\n=== Expedition 65/66 ===\nHoshide launched into space for the third time in 2021 aboard SpaceX Crew-2.  He will serve as a Flight Engineer on Expedition 65 and then Commander of Expedition 66. On April 27 2021, Hoshide assumed Command of the ISS from NASA astronaut Shannon Walker, becoming only the second Japanese astronaut to command the station, following Koichi Wakata who commanded Expedition 39 in 2014.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nNASA bio\nSpacefacts biography of Akihiko Hoshide", "infobox": {"name": "Akihiko Hoshide", "image": "Akihiko Hoshide 2012.jpg", "type": "[[NASDA]]/[[Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency|JAXA]] Astronaut", "status": "Active", "nationality": "Japanese", "birth_date": "{{Birth date and age|mf|=|yes|1968|12|28}}", "birth_place": "[[Setagaya, Tokyo]], Japan", "occupation": "[[Engineer]]", "selection": "[[List of astronauts by selection#1999|1999 NASDA Group]]", "space_time": "340 days 11 hours 41 minutes", "evas": "4", "eva_time": "28&nbsp;hours and 17&nbsp;minutes", "missions": "[[STS-124]], [[Soyuz TMA-05M]] ([[Expedition 32]]/[[Expedition 33|33]]), [[SpaceX Crew-2]] ([[Expedition 65]]/[[Expedition 66|66]])", "insignia": "[[File:STS-124 patch.svg|50px]] [[File:Soyuz-TMA-05M-Mission-Patch.png|50px]] [[File:ISS Expedition 32 Patch.svg|50px]] [[File:ISS Expedition 33 Patch.svg|50px]] [[File:SpaceX Crew-2 logo.png|50px]] [[File:ISS Expedition 65 Patch.png|35px]] [[File:ISS Expedition 66 Patch.svg|50px]]", "alma_mater": "[[Keio University]]<br />\n[[University of Houston]]"}, "wikidata": {"sex or gender (P21)": "male (Q6581097)", "Commons category (P373)": "Hoshide Akihiko", "instance of (P31)": "human (Q5)", "date of birth (P569)": "+1968-12-28T00:00:00Z", "image (P18)": "Akihoshide.jpg", "place of birth (P19)": "Setagaya-ku (Q231645)", "Freebase ID (P646)": "/m/0gxcmn", "VIAF ID (P214)": "295045247", "National Diet Library ID (P349)": "001115992", "occupation (P106)": "astronaut (Q11631)", "country of citizenship (P27)": "Japan (Q17)", "given name (P735)": "Akihiko (Q4700908)", "educated at (P69)": ["University of Houston (Q1472358)", "Keio University (Q815432)", "Maki Gakuen Junior and Senior High School (Q11617242)", "United World College of South East Asia (Q1784861)"], "Twitter username (P2002)": "Aki_Hoshide", "name in kana (P1814)": "\u307b\u3057\u3067 \u3042\u304d\u3072\u3053", "time in space (P2873)": {"amount": "+490270", "unit": "http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q7727"}, "name in native language (P1559)": "\u661f\u51fa\u5f70\u5f66", "CiNii author ID (books) (P271)": "DA18003100", "ISNI (P213)": "0000 0003 9978 9883", "WikiTree person ID (P2949)": "\u661f\u51fa-1", "WorldCat Identities ID (P7859)": "viaf-295045247", "member of the crew of (P5096)": ["Soyuz TMA-05M (Q796537)", "SpaceX Crew-2 (Q97769209)"], "employer (P108)": ["National Space Development Agency (Q2704796)", "Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (Q179103)"], "social media followers (P8687)": [{"amount": "+97401", "unit": "1"}, {"amount": "+134433", "unit": "1"}], "MyAnimeList people ID (P4084)": "40703", "family name (P734)": "Hoshide (Q56538706)", "astronaut mission (P450)": ["STS-124 (Q217550)", "Soyuz TMA-05M (Q796537)", "Expedition 32 (Q17231)", "Expedition 33 (Q17235)", "SpaceX Crew-2 (Q97769209)", "Expedition 65 (Q97166931)"], "Google Arts & Culture entity ID (P10297)": "m0gxcmn"}, "cat": "Astronauts", "url": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akihiko_Hoshide"}, {"name": "Aleksandr Aleksandrovich Volkov", "url_name": "745086", "txt": "Aleksandr Aleksandrovich Volkov (Russian: \u0410\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0430\u0301\u043d\u0434\u0440 \u0410\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0430\u0301\u043d\u0434\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447 \u0412\u043e\u0301\u043b\u043a\u043e\u0432; born 27 May 1948) is a retired Russian cosmonaut. He is a veteran of 3 space flights, including twice to the Mir Soviet space station, and is the father of cosmonaut Sergey Volkov.\n\n\n== Biography and career ==\nVolkov was born in Ukrainian SSR in a family of Russian ethnicity. At the age of 13, Volkov witnessed Yuri Gagarin become the first man in space and this inspired him to become a cosmonaut. He joined the Soviet space programme and became a test pilot before realising his dream.\nHe flew into space three times. His first spaceflight was a trip to Salyut 7 in 1985 (64 days in space), followed by two flights to the Mir space station, in 1988\u20131989 (151 days) and again in 1991\u20131992 (175 days) as commander of flight Soyuz TM-13. On board the Mir space station, he controlled the docking procedures among other things.\nThe Soviet Union broke up in 1991 during his second stay on board Mir. At the time Volkov was orbiting Earth on Mir with Sergei K. Krikalev, \"the last citizens of the USSR\".

Kaleri has most recently been in space aboard the ISS serving as a flight engineer for the long duration Expedition 25/26 missions. He has spent the fourth-longest time in space of any person, the longest time in space of any currently active cosmonaut, and the longest time in space of any person not born in what is now Russia.\n\n\n== Personal ==\nKaleri is married to the Svetlana L. Nosova. They have a son, Oleg Aleksandrovich Kaleri, born in 1996. Kaleri's mother, Antonina Petrovna Kaleri, resides in Sevastopol, Crimea, and his father, Yuri Borisovich Kaleri, is deceased. Kaleri enjoys running, reading and gardening.\n\n\n== Education ==\nIn 1979, Kaleri graduated from the Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology, Dolgoprudny, Moscow region, as a specialist in Aircraft Flight Dynamics and Control. In 1983, he completed post-graduate studies at the same institute as a specialist in the field of Mechanics of Fluids and Plasma.\n\n\n== Experience ==\nIn 1979, he was hired by the Energia Corporation and worked on the Mir space station. He participated in development of design and engineering documentation, full-scale tests of the Mir. Kaleri is a skilled programmer.\n\n\n== Cosmonaut career ==\n\nKaleri was selected as the Energia RSC cosmonaut candidate in April 1984. Between 1985 and 1986, he completed basic training and evaluation at the Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Center. In 1987 he was qualified for flight assignment as a test cosmonaut.\nKaleri took a training course for a spaceflight aboard the Mir orbital station as a backup crew flight engineer of the Mir-3 mission from 1 April to 9 December 1987. He took a training course for a spaceflight aboard the Mir as a backup crew flight engineer of the Mir-9 mission from January to April 1991. From 8 October 1991 to 25 February 1992, Kaleri was training as a primary crew flight engineer for the Mir-11 mission.\nKaleri has participated in three extended missions aboard the Mir Space Station. In 1992, he participated in a 145-day flight aboard the Soyuz-TM-14 spacecraft and the Mir. Between 17 August 1996 to 2 March 1997, Kaleri spent 197-days in space aboard the Soyuz-TM-24 spacecraft and the Mir as the Mir-22 mission flight engineer. In 2000, Kaleri performed his third spaceflight aboard the Soyuz-TM-30 spacecraft and the Mir as the Mir-28 mission flight engineer.\n\n\n=== Expedition 8 ===\nIn 2003, he first flew to the International Space Station (ISS) with NASA astronaut Michael Foale on his fourth spaceflight. Kaleri served as a Flight Engineer on Expedition 8 and spent 194 days in space from 18 October 2003 to 30 April 2004. The Soyuz TMA-3 spacecraft carrying Kaleri, Foale and ESA astronaut Andr\u00e9 Kuipers successfully landed in Kazakhstan at 00:11 GMT on 30 April 2004. The landing site was located some 60 kilometers northeast of the town of Arkalyk.\n\n\n=== Expedition 25/26 ===\nKaleri was a member (Flight Engineer) of the ISS Expedition 25/26, that was launched on 7 October 2010 from Baikonur Cosmodrome, aboard Soyuz TMA-01M spacecraft, together with cosmonaut Oleg Skripochka and NASA astronaut Scott Kelly. He served as the Soyuz commander. The mission marked Kaleri's fifth flight into space. He arrived at the ISS after the Soyuz spacecraft linked up with the space station at 00:01 UTC on 10 October 2010. He remained in the ISS till March 2011. During their mission, Kaleri and the rest of the Expedition 25/26 crew participated in a wide array of research, including fundamental physics, biometric experiments and investigations of crystal growth in space, as well as education outreach.\n\n\n=== Spacewalks ===\n\nKaleri has participated in five spacewalks and has accumulated 23 EVA hours.\nOn 8 July 1992, at 12:38 UTC Kaleri started his first career spacewalk. During the spacewalk, he and cosmonaut Aleksandr Viktorenko inspected some of Mir's gyrodynes. The spacewalk lasted 2 hours and 3 minutes.\nOn 2 December 1996, Kaleri and fellow cosmonaut Valery Korzun completed a 5 hours 57 minutes long spacewalk. The main purpose was to complete connections of the cooperative solar array to provide more electrical power to the Mir station. The spacewalk was Kaleri's second career spacewalk.\nOn 9 December 1996, Kaleri and fellow cosmonaut Valery Korzun completed a 6 hours 36 minutes long spacewalk. The spacewalk began at 13:50 UTC and ended at 20:28 UTC. During the spacewalk, the two cosmonauts completed connecting the solar array and attached a new Kurs docking antenna subsequently used to guide Progress vehicles docking with Mir. They also repaired the transceiver system that the Mir crew used to talk to amateur operators all around the world.On 12 May 2000, Kaleri and fellow cosmonaut Sergei Zalyotin completed a five-hour spacewalk to inspect the exterior of Mir. The two spacewalkers also tested a glue which would have been useful to seal tiny cracks, and applied the new airtight sealant to a special panel imitating a damaged section in Mir's skin. The two cosmonauts also examined the exterior of the Progress M1-2 cargo spacecraft.\nOn 26 February 2004, Kaleri and NASA astronaut Michael Foale floated outside the ISS from the Pirs Docking Compartment airlock. The spacewalk began at 4:17 EST, and Foale and Kaleri were able to complete all but two of their planned tasks, swapping out experiment packages and mounting an instrumented dummy torso on the station's hull to measure the radiation environment faced by spacewalking astronauts. Although the spacewalk was originally planned for 5 hours and 30 minutes, it was cut short due to a cooling system malfunction in Kaleri's spacesuit. Kaleri reported seeing drops of water on the inside of his spacesuit's visor. The spacewalk lasted 3 hours and 55 minutes. The excursion was the fifth career spacewalk for Kaleri.\n\n\n== Honours and awards ==\nHero of the Russian Federation (11 August 1992) - for the successful implementation of long-duration space flight on the orbital station Mir and displaying courage and heroism\nOrder of Merit for the Fatherland;\n2nd class (9 November 2000) -

The landing site was located some 60 kilometers northeast of the town of Arkalyk.\n\n\n=== Expedition 25/26 ===\nKaleri was a member (Flight Engineer) of the ISS Expedition 25/26, that was launched on 7 October 2010 from Baikonur Cosmodrome, aboard Soyuz TMA-01M spacecraft, together with cosmonaut Oleg Skripochka and NASA astronaut Scott Kelly. He served as the Soyuz commander. The mission marked Kaleri's fifth flight into space. He arrived at the ISS after the Soyuz spacecraft linked up with the space station at 00:01 UTC on 10 October 2010. He remained in the ISS till March 2011. During their mission, Kaleri and the rest of the Expedition 25/26 crew participated in a wide array of research, including fundamental physics, biometric experiments and investigations of crystal growth in space, as well as education outreach.\n\n\n=== Spacewalks ===\n\nKaleri has participated in five spacewalks and has accumulated 23 EVA hours.\nOn 8 July 1992, at 12:38 UTC Kaleri started his first career spacewalk. During the spacewalk, he and cosmonaut Aleksandr Viktorenko inspected some of Mir's gyrodynes. The spacewalk lasted 2 hours and 3 minutes.\nOn 2 December 1996, Kaleri and fellow cosmonaut Valery Korzun completed a 5 hours 57 minutes long spacewalk. The main purpose was to complete connections of the cooperative solar array to provide more electrical power to the Mir station. The spacewalk was Kaleri's second career spacewalk.\nOn 9 December 1996, Kaleri and fellow cosmonaut Valery Korzun completed a 6 hours 36 minutes long spacewalk. The spacewalk began at 13:50 UTC and ended at 20:28 UTC. During the spacewalk, the two cosmonauts completed connecting the solar array and attached a new Kurs docking antenna subsequently used to guide Progress vehicles docking with Mir. They also repaired the transceiver system that the Mir crew used to talk to amateur operators all around the world.On 12 May 2000, Kaleri and fellow cosmonaut Sergei Zalyotin completed a five-hour spacewalk to inspect the exterior of Mir. The two spacewalkers also tested a glue which would have been useful to seal tiny cracks, and applied the new airtight sealant to a special panel imitating a damaged section in Mir's skin. The two cosmonauts also examined the exterior of the Progress M1-2 cargo spacecraft.\nOn 26 February 2004, Kaleri and NASA astronaut Michael Foale floated outside the ISS from the Pirs Docking Compartment airlock. The spacewalk began at 4:17 EST, and Foale and Kaleri were able to complete all but two of their planned tasks, swapping out experiment packages and mounting an instrumented dummy torso on the station's hull to measure the radiation environment faced by spacewalking astronauts. Although the spacewalk was originally planned for 5 hours and 30 minutes, it was cut short due to a cooling system malfunction in Kaleri's spacesuit. Kaleri reported seeing drops of water on the inside of his spacesuit's visor. The spacewalk lasted 3 hours and 55 minutes. The excursion was the fifth career spacewalk for Kaleri.\n\n\n== Honours and awards ==\nHero of the Russian Federation (11 August 1992) - for the successful implementation of long-duration space flight on the orbital station Mir and displaying courage and heroism\nOrder of Merit for the Fatherland;\n2nd class (9 November 2000) -

He flew on one spaceflight, for the first part of the long duration expedition Mir EO-2. He flew as a flight engineer, and was both launched and landed with the spacecraft Soyuz TM-2. He spent 174 days 3 hours 25 minutes in space. Married with one child, Laveykin retired on March 28, 1994.Launched in February 1987, his spaceflight was intended to last until December 1987, but doctors on the ground determined that he was having minor heart irregularities. For this reason, in July he was replaced by Soviet cosmonaut Aleksandr Pavlovich Aleksandrov, who stayed on Mir to the end of the expedition in December.\n\n\n== Awards ==\nHero of the Soviet Union\nPilot-Cosmonaut of the USSR\nOrder of Lenin and the Russian Federation Medal \"For Merit in Space Exploration\"\n\n\n== References ==", "infobox": {"image": "\u041b\u0430\u0432\u0435\u0439\u043a\u0438\u043d \u0410. \u0418..jpg", "name": "Aleksandr Ivanovich Laveykin", "type": "Cosmonaut", "nationality": "[[Soviet Union|Soviet]]", "birth_date": "{{birth date and age|1951|4|21|df|=|y}}", "birth_place": "[[Moscow]], [[USSR]]", "occupation": "[[Flight engineer]]", "selection": "[[List of astronauts by selection#1978|1978 Cosmonaut Group]]", "time": "174d 03h 25m", "mission": "[[Mir EO-2]] ([[Soyuz TM-2]])", "awards": "* [[Hero of the Soviet Union]]\n* [[Order of Lenin]]\n* [[Medal \"For Merit in Space Exploration\"]]"}, "wikidata": {"date of birth (P569)": "+1951-04-21T00:00:00Z", "instance of (P31)": "human (Q5)", "place of birth (P19)": "Moscow (Q649)", "occupation (P106)": ["engineer (Q81096)", "astronaut (Q11631)"], "educated at (P69)": "Bauman Moscow State Technical University (Q1472245)", "astronaut mission (P450)": "Soyuz TM-2 (Q738200)", "father (P22)": "Ivan Laveykin (Q4251982)", "Freebase ID (P646)": "/m/03kljw", "award received (P166)": ["Hero of the Soviet Union (Q178473)", "Order of Lenin (Q185493)", "Medal \"For Merit in Space Exploration\" (Q2567963)", "Badge of honor \"For Merit to the Taymyr\" (Q24829062)", "Pilot-Cosmonaut of the USSR (Q1428575)", "Hero of the Republic (Q84073147)"], "country of citizenship (P27)": "Soviet Union (Q15180)", "given name (P735)": "Aleksandr (Q17501806)", "GTAA ID (P1741)": "124538", "time in space (P2873)": {"amount": "+250765", "unit": "http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q7727"}, "warheroes.ru ID (P2943)": "2015", "image (P18)": "\u041b\u0430\u0432\u0435\u0439\u043a\u0438\u043d \u0410. \u0418..jpg", "member of political party (P102)": "Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Q79854)", "student of (P1066)": "School No.1212 (Q4525117)", "Commons category (P373)": "Aleksandr Laveykin", "sex or gender (P21)": "male (Q6581097)", "family name (P734)": "Laveykin (Q97719746)", "PLWABN ID (P7293)": "9811475731805606", "VIAF ID (P214)": "3203159035195101380007", "languages spoken, written or signed (P1412)": "Russian (Q7737)", "name in native language (P1559)": "\u0410\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0440 \u041b\u0430\u0432\u0435\u0439\u043a\u0438\u043d", "Biografija.ru ID (P10033)": "lavejkin-aleksandr-ivanovich", "Prabook ID (P3368)": "2559464"}, "cat": "Astronauts", "url": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleksandr_Laveykin"}, {"name": "Waste House", "url_name": "47834322", "txt": "Waste House is a building on the University of Brighton campus in the centre of Brighton on the south coast of England.  It was built between 2012 and 2014 as a project involving hundreds of students and apprentices and was designed by Duncan Baker-Brown, an architect who also lectures at the university.  The materials consist of a wide range of construction industry and household waste\u2014from toothbrushes and old jeans to VHS cassettes and bicycle inner tubes\u2014and it is the first public building in Europe to be built primarily of such products.  \"From a distance [resembling] an ordinary contemporary town house\", Waste House is designed to be low-energy and sustainable, and will be in continuous use as a test-bed for the university's design, architecture and engineering students.  The building has won several awards and was shortlisted for the Royal Institute of British Architects' Stephen Lawrence Prize in September 2015.\n\n\n== Background ==\nWaste House has its origins in an earlier project by Duncan Baker-Brown, a senior lecturer at the university and a director of architecture firm BBM Sustainable Design based at Cooksbridge railway station in East Sussex.  On Channel 4 television programme Grand Designs, he and designer and television presenter Kevin McCloud assembled a \"low-energy ... ecologically friendly\" prefabricated house made of organic materials.  It was the first such building to be constructed in the United Kingdom.  Baker-Brown was responsible for the design of this building, which was in turn referred to as \"The House that Kevin Built\".  Originally Baker-Brown planned simply to take down the building and re-erect it at the University.  Instead, the temporary building formed the prototype for Waste House, and since 2008 work has been undertaken at the University of Brighton Faculty of Arts to develop the ideas and techniques used on the programme in order to build a permanent house which can be used to test materials, construction theories and new techniques.  It is intended to be \"a real live research project\" as well as a building which the university and other groups can use.\n\n\n== Design and construction ==\nWork was planned to begin in 2012 in time for an end-of-year completion date and a public opening in February 2013.  These dates were not achieved, but preparation started on 26 November 2012 and by May 2013 construction was underway.  Work finished in April 2014, the building was featured as part of the Brighton Festival the following month, the public were able to view the interior during June 2014, and by August 2014 Waste House was complete.  Construction cost \u00a3140,000 and the total value of the contract was \u00a3200,000.  Waste House is the first permanent public building in Europe made from waste material.Over 300 students from the University of Brighton, City College Brighton & Hove (CCB) and apprentices from housing provider Mears Group were involved in the project.  The construction work was mainly undertaken by CCB students, the Mears apprentices and some volunteers, led by a project manager from Mears Group.  Students learning carpentry at CCB designed the timber-framed structure and the \"fine timber staircase, finished with a decorative flourish of offcuts\".  Many of the structural elements were created in the college's own workshops.  University of Brighton Faculty of Arts students worked with Baker-Brown on the design, the selection of materials and on interior features such as furniture.  Overall, 97.5% of the time taken to build Waste House\u20142,507 person-days\u2014was provided by students and volunteers, and about 700 people worked on the project.  A major aim of the project was to introduce students and apprentices to sustainable building techniques and to allow them to continue testing their ideas by retrofitting new fixtures.\n\n\n== Materials ==\nThe purpose of building Waste House was to demonstrate that material considered to be waste, and therefore destined for landfill, could be used to create a viable permanent building.  Baker-Brown stated that in the United Kingdom, 20% of construction materials go to waste\u2014so the equivalent of one house worth of unwanted material is generated for every five houses built.  Between 85% and 90% of the materials used in Waste House are building waste of this type or ordinary household and consumer products which are no longer needed.\n\nStructurally, the building is timber-framed and uses a mixture of reclaimed wood and plywood from various sources around Brighton.  It has been constructed on foundations of ground granulated blast-furnace slag.  The \"rather unusual\" walls consist of a mixture of waste chalk and clay left over or reclaimed from building sites.  These are compressed into rammed earth-style walls using pneumatic equipment\u2014a technique which improves the building's energy conservation, because such walls store solar energy for a long time.  On the outside the walls are covered with \"a scaly surface of rubbery black shingles\"\u20142,000 carpet tiles from an old office building in Brighton.  Their fire-retardant, waterproof underlay faces outwards, providing weatherproof cladding and insulation.  Their mostly black appearance is varied in places by being laminated with plastic bags in various colours.  Between the carpet tiles and the walls themselves, some new material was used: DuPont supplied about 400 square metres (4,300 sq ft) of \"breathable membrane\", to further weatherproof the building, and \"Housewrap\" moisture seal.  Inside, the walls are laid with reclaimed plasterboard coated with surplus paint from construction sites.  The main load-bearing wall is formed of 10 tonnes of compressed chalk spoil from a building site nearby.  Throughout the building, the space between the boarding and the exterior clay and chalk blocks has been filled with household rubbish which will act as insulation.  Sensors have been installed to monitor how well heat is kept in, which will form part of a PhD project for a University of Brighton student.  The insulation materials are revealed in various places by \"little peephole windows\" (transparent panels in the walls): as well as some secondhand conventional (polyurethane) insulation material, there are floppy disks, 4,000 VHS cassettes, 4,000 DVD and video cases, two tonnes of denim offcuts from pairs of jeans and denim jackets, cycle inner tubes to insulate windows, and 20,000 toothbrushes.  The cassettes and other media came from the stock of rental shops which were closing down; an aeroplane cleaning company at nearby Gatwick Airport donated most of the toothbrushes, which were provided to First and Business Class passengers and discarded after one use, and some others were provided by Brighton schoolchildren; and the denim came from textile traders (in particular, one company which turned imported jeans into denim shorts by cutting off the legs).Many materials were obtained on the Freegle website\u2014a free reuse and recycling service developed from The Freecycle Network.  These include the clay tiles on the roof, the kitchen and some of the insulation material.  Cat Fletcher, one of the founders of Freegle UK, was part of the Waste House project team and was responsible for obtaining many of the materials, both from Freegle members (numbering 18,000 in the Brighton area) and from other sources.  Other than the specialist cladding materials supplied by DuPont, the only new products used in the building are the triple-glazed windows and the material used in the wiring and plumbing.\n\n\n== Awards and reception ==\nIn September 2015, Waste House was nominated for that year's Stephen Lawrence Prize.  This Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA) award, named after the aspiring architect who was murdered in 1993, is for projects with a budget of up to \u00a31 million.  In its shortlisting for the award, which was judged in mid-October 2015, judges from the RIBA stated that the house \"has sufficient scientific integrity to be taken seriously by the construction industry\" and the potential to alter political attitudes to recycling.  Waste House was one of seven buildings nominated for the prize, which was won by a fishing hut designed by Niall McLaughlin Architects.Waste House was one of several buildings in Sussex, along with the Chichester Festival Theatre and St Botolph's Church at Botolphs, to win an award at the RIBA South East Regional Awards in April 2015.  It was described as \"a project with an interesting agenda\" and \"a collective of experiments in which students learn by application\".  Duncan Baker-Brown also won an Argus Achievement Award from local newspaper The Argus.RIBA awarded Waste House a Sustainability Award in 2014.  It described \"some of the experiments [as] extraordinary\", commenting specifically on the toothbrush insulation and the vinyl banner vapour control layers, and noted that \"the continually evolving [design] brief\" would \"continue to question important issues of recycling that affect everyone\".The 2Degrees Network, a worldwide collaborative association of sustainable businesses, awarded the building a Champions Award in 2014.  Waste House was described as \"an investment in educating the next generation of designers and builders to think and build more sustainably\".In view of its low energy use, Waste House has a building energy rating of A.  When work started, Baker-Brown stated the aim of making it one of the United Kingdom's first A*-rated buildings.\n\n\n== See also ==\nBuildings and architecture of Brighton and Hove\nSustainable architecture\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Waste House, Brighton at Wikimedia Commons", "infobox": {"name": "Waste House", "status": "complete", "image": "Waste House, University of Brighton, Grand Parade, Brighton (September 2015) (17).JPG", "caption": "The building from the south-southeast", "map_type": "United Kingdom Brighton", "map_caption": "Location in central [[Brighton]]", "architectural_style": "[[Contemporary architecture|Contemporary]] ([[Sustainable architecture|Sustainable]])", "cost": "\u00a3140,000", "owner": "[[University of Brighton]]", "address": "[[University of Brighton Faculty of Arts]], 58\u201367 Grand Parade, [[Brighton]] BN2&nbsp;0JY", "location_town": "[[Brighton and Hove]]", "location_country": "United Kingdom", "coordinates": "{{coord|50.823547|-0.134809|display|=|inline,title}}", "groundbreaking_date": "26 November 2012", "start_date": "May 2013", "completion_date": "April 2014", "opening_date": "10 June 2014", "floor_count": "2", "main_contractor": "[[Mears Group]]", "architect": "Duncan Baker-Brown", "architecture_firm": "BBM Sustainable Design"}, "wikidata": {"country (P17)": "United Kingdom (Q145)", "instance of (P31)": "building (Q41176)", "owned by (P127)": "University of Brighton (Q3056813)", "made from material (P186)": "carpet tile (Q2404195)", "Commons category (P373)": "Waste House, Brighton", "image (P18)": "Waste House, University of Brighton, Grand Parade, Brighton (September 2015) (17).JPG", "coordinate location (P625)": {"latitude": 50.82354736, "longitude": -0.134809, "altitude": null, "precision": 1e-06, "globe": "http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q2"}, "floors above ground (P1101)": {"amount": "+2", "unit": "1"}, "located in the administrative territorial entity (P131)": "Brighton and Hove (Q1022488)", "inception (P571)": "+2014-04-00T00:00:00Z", "street address (P6375)": "58\u201367 Grand Parade", "postal code (P281)": "BN2 0JY", "has quality (P1552)": "sustainable architecture (Q185035)", "occupant (P466)": "University of Brighton Faculty of Arts (Q86015343)", "significant event (P793)": "groundbreaking (Q1068633)", "cost (P2130)": {"amount": "+140000", "unit": "http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q25224"}, "main building contractor (P193)": "Mears Group (Q19903450)", "historic county (P7959)": "Sussex (Q23346)", "Atlas Obscura identifier (P7772)": "brighton-waste-house", "Google Knowledge Graph ID (P2671)": "/g/11b8_yzqjt"}, "cat": "Building", "url": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waste_House"}, {"name": "Power Tower", "url_name": "30339188", "txt": "The Power Tower is the first high-rise office tower to attempt to meet the strict Passive House energy efficiency building standard.  It was built to house the corporate headquarters of the Austrian utility company Energie AG in Linz, Austria.In accordance with the Passive House standard the building has no connection to the local district heating system, and requires no fossil fuel inputs to maintain a comfortable interior climate, resulting in much lower carbon dioxide emissions than comparable buildings.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn 2004 Energie AG decided to replace its corporate headquarters, built in the 1930s, with a much more efficient building.  After an architectural competition the Z\u00fcrich firm Weber/Hofer was chosen to lead the design effort.  In the spring of 2006 construction began on the 3,750 m^2 lot.  The site houses a parking garage, a two story building, and the 19-story office tower.  Construction was completed in the late summer of 2008, and the building now provides offices for 600 employees of 13 different companies.\n\n\n== Building Energy Systems ==\nThe Power Tower minimizes its external energy consumption via several integrated systems. \n\n\n=== Advanced Building Envelope ===\nThe building envelope was specially engineered to allow maximum daylighting while minimizing solar gain, which would normally be excessive and require a great deal of active cooling, given that two thirds of the facade is composed of glazing. \n\n\n=== Geothermal Heating and Cooling ===\nBeneath the building, 46 geothermal wells, each 150 m deep were drilled prior to construction. \n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nEnergie AG Ober\u00f6sterreich", "infobox": {"name": "Power Tower", "image": "Power Tower ganz.jpg", "caption": "The Power Tower by day.", "location_town": "Linz", "location_country": "Austria", "start_date": "2006", "completion_date": "2008", "inauguration_date": "2008-09-08", "architect": "Kaufmann", "architecture_firm": "Weber & Hofer, Z\u00fcrich, Switzerland", "current_tenants": "Energie AG", "building_type": "Office Tower", "height": "74 m", "floor_count": "19", "floor_area": "22,652 m^2"}, "wikidata": {"Commons category (P373)": "Power Tower Linz", "country (P17)": "Austria (Q40)", "coordinate location (P625)": {"latitude": 48.2933, "longitude": 14.2906, "altitude": null, "precision": 0.0001, "globe": "http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q2"}, "located in the administrative territorial entity (P131)": "Linz (Q41329)", "instance of (P31)": "office building (Q1021645)", "image (P18)": "Power Tower Linz Fassade unten.jpg", "CTBUH Skyscraper Center building ID (P1305)": "5154", "floors above ground (P1101)": {"amount": "+19", "unit": "1"}, "number of elevators (P1301)": {"amount": "+6", "unit": "1"}, "height (P2048)": {"amount": "+74", "unit": "http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q11573"}, "has use (P366)": "headquarters (Q7540126)", "inception (P571)": "+2008-00-00T00:00:00Z", "Microsoft Academic ID (P6366)": "2780454338", "Freebase ID (P646)": "/m/0g5px54"}, "cat": "Building", "url": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_tower_(Linz)"}, {"name": "ENERPOS", "url_name": "39308049", "txt": "ENERPOS is the first educational net-zero energy building in the tropics and one of the 13 Net ZEBs in the tropics thanks to its bioclimatic design. Its name comes from the French \"\u00e9nergie positive\" (\"positive energy\" in English). ENERPOS is located on R\u00e9union Island, a French territory in the Indian Ocean. Building an energy-efficient building in such a climate is particularly challenging, but the energy expectations with regard to ENERPOS have been reached, even largely exceeded. ENERPOS is not only an energy-efficient building but also displays various passive methods to reduce energy consumption while providing a comfortable environment for its users. Classes are hosted for both undergraduate diploma and degree courses as well as for the Department of Construction and Energy at the Graduate Engineering School of R\u00e9union Island.\n\n\n== Location ==\nENERPOS is a university building located in Saint-Pierre on the French island of La R\u00e9union. This island, whose climate is hot and humid, is located in the Indian Ocean, to the east of Madagascar. This area is also often struck by tropical cyclones, generating building difficulties.\n\n\n== Context of R\u00e9union Island ==\nOver 800,000 inhabitants of R\u00e9union Island rely on a limited supply of energy. In addition to that, electricity production on R\u00e9union  Island is one of the most polluting on earth, mainly generated from fossil fuels such as coal and fuel. The electricity produced is expensive and is one of the most polluting in the world with 820 grams (29 oz) of CO2 produced with every kilowatt hour (close to eight times more than in mainland France). Unfortunately, the ever-increasing demand for energy, due to significant demographic growth, sometimes exceeds the amount of energy available. As a consequence, shortages can occur certain times during austral summers when air conditioning is widely used.\nAs is the case in other parts of the world, the electricity consumption of buildings represents a significant percentage of the energy used on R\u00e9union Island. Buildings in French Tropical zones, and especially on R\u00e9union Island, have often been awkwardly designed, contrary to former Creole vernacular architecture, importing metropolitan building concepts. Indeed, it has been common practice to build as cheaply as possible for decades, without any consideration for the environment and the climate, making it uncomfortable to live in without air conditioning. Moreover, air conditioning and lighting are usually oversized by designers, this leads to wasteful energy consumption.\nThe good news is that considerable improvements can be made in reducing energy consumption in the field of building on R\u00e9union Island.\n\n\n== Goal and achievements ==\nUnder the general context of energy supply and consumption on R\u00e9union Island, this building was expected to be net-zero energy and to export at least as much energy as its consumption to the polluting electricity grid of the island. To achieve this goal, the first issue to be addressed is the energy consumption of the building and how to build without using air conditioning, a considerable consumer, while providing a comfortable environment for the users. Air conditioning is only used in one-third of the total surface area for computers and servers, the remaining two-thirds are cooled and ventilated naturally. Passive methods are used, requiring people to be active instead of being passive in an active building (Fran\u00e7ois Garde, Ph.D., P.E. and ASHRAE member). At the beginning of the design of ENERPOS in 2005, the main aim was to demonstrate that the overall consumption of the building could be reduced by three times compared to that of a standard building. The result is that only one-seventh of the annual energy consumption of a standard building is used \u2013 14 kilowatt-hours per square metre (4.7 MJ/sq ft) instead of 100 kWh/m2 (33 MJ/sq ft) in a year. To compensate for this, photovoltaic panels are implemented over the rooftops, enabling the production of 71,118 kilowatt-hours (256,020 MJ) in 2010 compared to an overall consumption of 9,824 kWh (35,370 MJ), making this building one of the 13 Net ZEBs in a tropical climate. Saint Pierre is usually sunny all year and receives a heavy amount of solar radiation with up to 1.2 kilowatts per square metre (0.15 hp/sq ft) in summer. Consequently, the building consumes 7 times less energy than its production, the extra production of electricity being released into the grid.\nENERPOS meets the requirements of the following two performance labels, HQE and PERENE. PERENE is a local label in R\u00e9union Island guiding those wishing to abide by it on how to build in harmony with the corresponding climate (four different classifications are defined depending mainly on the altitude), Saint Pierre being in the hottest zone of the island.\n\n\n== Principles and features ==\n\n\n=== Natural cross ventilation ===\nHuman comfort depends on five criteria, two of which concern one\u2019s clothing and metabolism, and three others which focus on air temperature, air humidity and airflow speed. The faster the airflow is on someone the cooler he feels. Moreover, natural ventilation brings sound fresh air into the building when well-designed. Thus, natural ventilation tends to increase comfort as well as health in tropical climates and aims to suppress air conditioning.\nThe building has been orientated to prevent strong East-South-East trade winds from entering the rooms in winter and still benefit from thermal breezes in summer. The main fa\u00e7ades are then orientated North and South, reducing the heat gain on the Western and Southern fa\u00e7ades (which are more exposed to solar radiation) at the same time.\n\nSuccessful ventilation has been obtained by creating a window to wall ratio of 30% using louvres on both opposite sides of the rooms. Louvres are not only useful to regulate the airflow but also to protect against cyclones and break-ins. In addition to that, the surroundings of the building have been well-thought-out to prevent the ground from heating before entering the rooms:\n\nPlanting native plants and trees in the patio and around the building to create a microclimate which is as fresh as possible.\nPlacing car parks under the building instead of next to it for the same reason. Furthermore, it increases soil permeability so that tropical rains do not cause floods but penetrate the ground.Finally, large ceiling fans are installed in every room, even those using air conditioning. Ceiling fans ensure that even in the absence of the necessary breezes, the airflow needed to feel comfortable in the room is provided for the users. This solution significantly reduces the amount of energy consumed. The overall consumption of the ceiling fans and the split system (the latter used to cool the technical rooms) is only 3.7 kilowatt-hours per square metre (1.2 MJ/sq ft) per year compared to a classic air conditioning system in a standard building consuming 80 kWh/m (88 MJ/ft) per year.\n\n\n=== Solar shading ===\n\nNow that the airflow parameter has been dealt with, the next issue to be addressed is air temperature. Most of the heat gained in the rooms is due to solar radiation coming through the glazing.\nBarely any glazing has been placed on the Western and Eastern small fa\u00e7ades because they are the most likely to receive solar radiation. The two main fa\u00e7ades, including the louvres, are protected against direct sun rays thanks to vertical solar shading composed of inclined wooden strips. To be as efficient as possible, solar shading has been simulated with 3-D software. This glazing protection has two main effects: to prevent glare on the desks, which can be very annoying for the students and the employees working in ENERPOS; and to decrease indoor temperature.\n\n\n=== Materials ===\nConcerning the envelope, the walls are made of concrete; the roofing is insulated with a 10-centimetre (3.9 in) layer of polystyrene and a ventilated BIPV (Building Integrated Photovoltaic) over-roof; the solar shading systems are made of wooden strips; the east and west gables are insulated with mineral wood and wooden cladding. The paint used is completely organic and the wooden components have not undergone any specific treatment. No insulation is required on the main facades as they are very efficient in terms of S-value due to the solar shading.\n\n\n=== Lighting ===\nDaylighting has also been simulated to ensure a Useful Daylight Index (UDI) of at least 90% in most places. Two classrooms facing the sea on the first floor of the building do not have any artificial lighting. Except for those two classrooms, all classrooms and offices are lit by low energy consumption lights producing an artificial lighting density inferior to that of a standard building, 7 watts per square metre (0.00087 hp/sq ft) in the classrooms with low energy T-5 lights and 3.7 W/m2 (0.00046 hp/sq ft) in the offices with personal LED desks lamps. These lighting densities are high enough to make these workplaces comfortable to work in and yet reduce both the energy consumption and the thermal heat gain produced by the lights in so far as is possible.\nThere are multiple switches to control the lights and ceiling fans by the rows of tables in the classrooms since some people could feel hot or do not have enough light while others are comfortable. This avoids wasting electricity.\nA Building Management System is used to control the active systems. In the event of people forgetting to turn off the light when leaving a room, a timer will turn off lights automatically after two hours.\n\n\n=== Computing ===\nThis is similar to the lighting issue as computing systems can affect both energy consumption and thermal heat gain greatly. The main solution adopted in the offices is to use laptops rather than desktop computers since they usually consume less electricity. As for the computer rooms, they are only equipped with screens, mice and keyboards and all central units are located in the air-conditioned technical room. The thermal loads from the computers are thus kept outside the computing rooms.\n\n\n=== Photovoltaic production ===\n\nAs previously explained is, the city of Saint Pierre receives a huge amount of solar radiation throughout the year. This natural source of energy has consequently been exploited. The target is to make ENERPOS a positive energy building thanks to solar panels, the PV production must be at least equal to the energy consumption of the building.\nSince the photovoltaic panels have been used as an over-roof, the overall surface of the panels has been oversized compared to the energy needs to protect the whole roof from direct sun rays. The low energy consumption of ENERPOS is more than balanced by 365 square metres (3,930 sq ft) of these integrated solar panels, generating a total production of 71,118 kilowatt-hours (256,020 MJ) over one year. The resulting surplus of energy, not being consumed by the building but released into the grid instead, is then up to 61 kilowatt-hours (220 MJ) in a year.\nFurthermore, all of the costs and risks of this installation are provided by the manufacturer, as agreed in the contract, and not by the owner of ENERPOS (that is to say the University of R\u00e9union Island). In exchange, the University of R\u00e9union Island rents the photovoltaic production to the manufacturer who receives the benefit of the electricity fed into the grid for 15 years. After that period, the owner of the building becomes the owner of the PV panels.\n\n\n== Making the users active ==\nThe energy consumption of a building not only relies on the way it has been built but also mainly on occupant behaviour. This idea is all the more true for buildings being constructed based on passive designs. Indeed, making ENERPOS a passive building implies that people need to be active to use it to its full capacity.\nFor example, before turning on the ceiling fans of a classroom, the students have to open the louvres first. It seems to be common sense but as a matter of fact, people do not think about that most of the time. That is why signs are displayed in the rooms explaining how to use a classroom properly to avoid wasting energy. The purpose is to educate students (and teachers) about the way to behave and to make them realize the environmental issues at stake on R\u00e9union Island.\n\n\n== Post-occupancy evaluation ==\nSince ENERPOS is a pioneer project on R\u00e9union Island and in the tropics, it is essential to analyze the consumption distribution, the performance and how people feel in this building. Therefore, a post-occupancy evaluation has been carried out for three hot seasons to assess the comfort level in ENERPOS. Students and teachers were asked to fill in a questionnaire about how they feel in the building while environmental parameters, such as temperatures, humidity and air velocity, were collected.\nThe main conclusion is that out of 700 students surveyed, the vast majority feel comfortable in ENERPOS in the hot season without any air conditioning. The ultimate objective of this project has then been met.\n\n\n== Results ==\nAmong the annual 14.4 kilowatt-hours per square metre (4.8 MJ/sq ft) consumption of ENERPOS, the energy end uses are listed in the table.\nThe contribution of the plug loads to the overall energy consumption is abnormally high compared to a standard building because the air conditioning and lighting parts have been well reduced.\nTo conclude, the ENERPOS building shows that it is possible to build an educational Net ZEB in the tropics while providing a comfortable environment for people to work and study in. Moreover, the lessons learnt about the ENERPOS project can be applied to green building and Net ZEB projects in hot climates.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nAutonomous buildings\nBuilding-integrated photovoltaics\nCategory:Low-energy building\nEnergy conservation\nGreen building\nHome energy monitor\nPlug load\nSustainable design\nNet-zero energy building\n\n\n== References ==\nhttp://www.hpbmagazine.org/case-studies/educational/university-of-la-reunions-enerpos-saintpierre-la-reunion-france\nhttp://www.nxtbook.com/nxtbooks/ashrae/hpb_2012summer/\n\n\n== External links ==\nUniversity of Reunion Island\nESIROI\nInstitute of technology\nPiment laboratory", "infobox": {"name": "ENERPOS", "image": "Enerpos1ciel.jpg", "map_type": "R\u00e9union", "map_alt": "Location within R\u00e9union", "etymology": "[[French language|French]]: {{underline|\u00c9ner}} gie {{underline|pos}} itive", "building_type": "Educational", "location": "[[Saint-Pierre, R\u00e9union|Saint-Pierre]]", "location_country": "France", "coordinates": "{{coord|-21.340846|55.490897|type:landmark|display|=|inline,title}}", "opened_date": "{{start date and age|2008}}", "cost": "$1.7 million", "owner": "[[University of Reunion Island]]", "floor_area": "{{convert|739|m2|sqft|abbr|=|on}}"}, "wikidata": {"image (P18)": "Enerpos1ciel.jpg", "located in the administrative territorial entity (P131)": "Saint-Pierre (Q249884)", "instance of (P31)": "building (Q41176)", "coordinate location (P625)": {"latitude": -21.340846, "longitude": 55.490897, "altitude": null, "precision": 0.009644453434223795, "globe": "http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q2"}, "country (P17)": "France (Q142)", "continent (P30)": "Africa (Q15)", "Freebase ID (P646)": "/m/0vpsnps"}, "cat": "Building", "url": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ENERPOS"}, {"name": "ArthaLand Century Pacific Tower", "url_name": "43369994", "txt": "The ArthaLand Century Pacific Tower is a 32-storey office building in Bonifacio Global City in Taguig, Metro Manila, Philippines.

It is used by the City of Melbourne council, and in April 2005, became the first purpose-built office building in Australia to achieve a maximum Six Green Star rating, certified by the Green Building Council of Australia. CH2 officially opened in August 2006.\n\n\n== Environmental features ==\nComparing to a building with a six Green Star rating, CH2's emissions will be 64% lower. When compared to the existing Council House next door, it is expected to:\n\nreduce electricity consumption by 85%\nreduce gas consumption by 87%\nproduce only 13% of the emissions\nreduce water mains supply by 72%Features include new LCD computer monitors, which will consume 77% less energy, and new T5 light fittings which should consume 65% less energy. The building also houses 48 m2 of solar panels, which provide 60% of hot water, as well as a gas-fired cogeneration plant which provides 40% of the building's overall electricity and heating, with significantly reduced carbon emissions. The cogeneration plant is powered by a Capstone C65 microturbine which produces 65 kW of electricity and 130 kW of hot water.Of the total construction cost of $51 million, $12 million were invested in energy, water and waste innovation. The time for payback is expected to be less than ten years.\n\n\n== Design ==\nCH2 is meant to be a 'lighthouse project' for new building developments, aiming to influence future design to be more sustainable and efficient. Some objectives when designing the building were to be greenhouse neutral and improve the overall employee wellbeing. Different strategies were used when doing this but all were focused around a sustainability aspect.\nBiomimicry was a large component in designing the building. The building's principal design architect, Mick Pearce, incorporated a system previously and successfully used in the Eastgate Centre in Harare. The heating, ventilating, and cooling system (hvac) is designed with strategies taken from a termite mound. In the termite mound, the cool wind is drawn into the base of the mound, via channels and the 'coolth' is stored using wet soil. As the air warms, it flows upwards and out of the mound via vents. This gives the mound the ability to keep a stable temperature. CH2 uses similar strategies with its system by effectively using natural convection, ventilation stacks, thermal mass, phase change material, and water for cooling. Another strategy used taken from nature is the skin system. The fa\u00e7ade is composed of an epidermis (outer skin) and dermis (inner skin). The 'dermis' of the building consists of the outside zone to house the stairs, lifts, ducts, balconies, sunscreens and foliage with the inner line defining the extent of the 'fire compartment'. The dermis was designed with lightweight constructing using a steel frame. The epidermis provides the micro-environment including the primary sun and glare control for the building while creating a semi enclosed micro-environment.\nVentilation stacks are implemented on the north and south fa\u00e7ades of the building. These stacks are used to channel air. The north stacks receive more sun so they are black to absorb heat, which in turn encourages the warm air from the building to rise up out of the stacks. The south stacks are used to channel down cold air through the vents. These stacks also offer shading for office windows.\nThe ceilings are made from pre-cast concrete, with a 'wavy' shape, to optimise surface area, which allows for an increase in thermal mass capacity. The thermal mass in the concrete is flushed at night, through a night purge, absorbing 'coolth' form the night air and allowing it to absorb heat from the space during the day. With the 'wavy' design, heated air is collected at ceiling height, and then channelled out of the building and into the ventilation stacks. Radiant cooling is also a strategy used by running chilled water through beams and ceiling panels. Chilled panels cool the rising warm air, which then drops, creating a natural convection current. Phase change material is used to cool the water for the chilled beams and panels. It efficiently helps to keep the water circulating through the beams and panels at a desired temperature. The phase change material is often referred to as the 'battery' of the building because of its purpose of storing the 'coolth'.\nNatural day lighting was a difficult task for the CH2 team due to the building's orientation and position in relation to surrounding buildings, and the requirement for a deep open plan office space. The best design techniques for CH2 to allow the most natural light included a synergy between windows size and air ducts, light shelves to reflect light into the office area, vaulted ceilings to allow further light penetration, shading on north, west, and east fa\u00e7ades, and finally timber louvres to control light penetration from the afternoon western sun. The light shelves were placed on the north fa\u00e7ade which in turn will create a soft indirect light on the roof space. These light shelves are placed externally and made of fabric in a steel frame. The vaulted ceilings allow for more natural light filtering to the deeper parts of the office space. Locating the windows at the highest point of the curve improved this technique. The east facing fa\u00e7ade uses a perforated metal system for shading that also acts like a thermal chimney. Heat rises pulling air through the eastern part of the building allowing it to be naturally ventilated. The north facing fa\u00e7ade is composed of steel trellises and balconies supporting vertical gardens nine stories high. The foliage protects the building from the sun and also filters sunlight for a reduction of indoor glares. Light shelves are used to provide shading as well as reflect natural light into the building. These light shelves are placed externally and made of fabric in a steel frame. The west facing fa\u00e7ade is covered with a system of timber louvres that pivot to optimise the penetration of natural light and views. These louvres also protect the fa\u00e7ade from the harsh western sun. The louvres open and close depending on the amount of sun that is hitting the western fa\u00e7ade. The louvres are made from untreated recycled timber and are moved by a computer-controlled hydraulic system. The building also uses artificial lighting throughout to provide a sufficient amount of light when natural light is not available. These lights use the low-energy T5 luminaries which achieve a lighting power density of less than 2.5 watts/m2 per 100 lux.\nShower towers are used on the southern fa\u00e7ade. These towers draw outside air from above street level and cool the air by evaporation to form the shower of water. The cool air is then supplied to the retail spaces and the cool water is used to pre-cool the water coming from the chilled water panels. The towers are made from tubes of lightweight fabric 1.4 meters in diameter. Testing from these towers has shown a temperature reduction of 4 to 13 degrees Celsius from the top of the tower to the bottom of the tower.\nThe designers also used an innovative concept of design by using the same amount of foliage on the building as would have been present if the site was still in its original natural vegetated state. This is accomplished by using a roof garden, which also serves as a break-out and recreation space for staff. The northern fa\u00e7ade also incorporates planter boxes situated east and west of each northern balcony.\n\n\n== Indoor environment quality ==\nA main concern when designing CH2 was the indoor environment quality (IEQ), and many steps were made to optimise this in particular. With an improvement in the overall IEQ designers believed this could lead to fewer sick days of occupants, fewer headaches and better well-being while staff are at work. The City of Melbourne's aim was to create a healthy, comfortable, adaptable and stimulating work environment for the staff. Strategies used to improve the IEQ include a well-designed working environment, fresh air, natural light, greenery, and use of materials that emit low amounts of volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Not only do these strategies improve the work place, but also can save the city money based on productivity gains.\nDisplacement ventilation was used as the primary ventilation in CH2. The advantages of using a displacement ventilation system include increased cost effectiveness in operation, improved air quality within occupied zone, greater operational efficiency, ability to conceal, quiet, and finally flexibility. The minimum fresh air requirement at CH2 is 22.5 litres/second/person. This is much higher than the Australian Standard of 10 litres/second/person (AS 1668.2)\nThe higher turnover rate was chosen because research has shown that low fresh air requirements can be directly linked to low productivity and sickness, including colds and flu.Natural light was optimised in the design of CH2 by creating a wavy ceiling, use of light shelves, larger windows at the bottom of building and smaller windows at the top, use of colours to accentuate the natural light, and the concepts that windowed areas were shared by all not owned individuals.\nThe interior of the building is also decorated with a variety of plant life with aesthetic purposes, as well as research that shows that plants reduce the amount of VOCs in the air. In addition to controlling VOCs with plants, CH2 planners chose materials to keep the indoor pollutants at a minimum. Low-VOC paints, low-VOC carpets, low-VOC adhesives and sealants, and low-emission formaldehyde composite wood products are all used in the interiors of the building.\n\n\n== Green Star Rating ==\nGreen Star rates the environmental performance of a building based, in this case, on its design. It is administrated by the Green Building Council of Australia (GBCA). The rating looks at the following aspects of the building process:\n\nBuilding Input\nManagement\nIndoor Environment Quality (IEQ)\nEnergy\nTransport\nWater\nMaterials\nLand Use & Ecology\nEmissions\nInnovationEach of these aspects are then broken up into smaller categories that cover a wide range of topics.\nGreen Star is a public method of demonstrating commitment to environmentally responsible building.  It provides a standard language to discuss sustainability for buildings.\nOn 22 March 2005, CH2 building design was awarded a 6 Star rating under Green Star \u2013 Office Design v1.  The following table presents the points possible, and points awarded for CH2\n\n\n== Post-Occupancy Reports ==\nNote: Post-occupancy reports were recorded after one year of building use while the building was still going under adjustments.\nThermal Comfort: Thermal dissatisfaction ratings should be below 10% in most locations of the building.  The perceived overall thermal comfort is also good but the airflow is perceived to be to low.\nAir Quality:The air quality of CH2 is excellent in terms of measured pollutant levels. The occupants also perceive the air quality to be better.  The formaldehyde concentrations are much lower than compared to common office buildings.  The overall air quality is excellent due to the 100% fresh air intake and the use of low toxicity materials used in all furnishings and finishes as well as an extensive use of indoor plants.\nNoise Levels: Ambient noise levels and reverberation times were considered ideal but the occupant satisfaction ratings for now were average to poor and were generally worse than benchmarks.  This is due to the open floor layout, which improves communication between employees, but allows for unwanted interruptions.  White noise increases satisfaction scores on one level compared to the rest of the building (10\u201318%).\nLighting: The background lighting levels are sufficient, and the recommended task illuminances could be achieved if personal task lighting was switched on.  Occupant satisfaction for lighting is average to poor in CH2 and is worse than some Building Uses Studies benchmarks (BUS).\nPerceived Productivity: Three-quarters of CH2 occupants rate the building as having a positive or neutral effect on productivity, compared to 39% in the original Council House.  CH2 is rated in the top 20% of Australian buildings for perceived productivity.\nPerceived Worker Health: CH2 is rated very highly for perceived healthiness, and is considered to have low levels of occupant reported rates for building related health symptoms.  Absenteeism and staff turnover has not changed but more time must pass to have conclusive data.\nOverall: 80% of occupants prefer CH2 to their previous accommodation.  It was also seen that the staff productivity improved 10.9% resulting in a cost savings of over two million dollars.  The improvement results in a seven-year payback period for the buildings environmental features, three years ahead of the suspected schedule of ten years.\n\n\n== Awards and recognition ==\n2004\n\nExemplar, Imagining the Future Award, Year of the Built Environment Awards, CRC Construction Innovation in association with DesignInc.2005\n\nSpecial Projects Initiative, Award of Excellence LG Pro Local Government Professionals\n6 Start Rating Certification, Green Start Rating Green Building Council of Australia\nGreen Building Award, World Environment Day Awards 2005 United Nations Association2006\n\nGreenhouse Expenditure Award, Eco-Buy Awards 2006\nRecycled Expenditure Award, Eco-Buy Awards 2006\nThe Hey Big Spender Award, Eco-Buy Awards 2006\nEnvironmental Planning or Conservation Award, Awards for Planning Excellence 2006, Planning Institute of Australia, Victoria Division2007\n\nEnvironment Planning or Conservation, National Awards for Planning Excellence, Planning Institute of Australia\nPresident's Award, National Awards for Planning Excellence, Planning Institute of Australia\nSustainable Architecture Award, 2007 Victorian Architecture Awards, Royal Australian Institute of Architects, Victorian Chapter in association with DesignInc.\nPresident's Award, 2007 Excellence in Property Awards, Australian Property Institute, Victorian Division\nSustainable Architecture Award, 2007 National Architecture Awards, Royal Australian Institute of Architects\nFinalist, Sustainable Design, Global Innovator's Awards 2007 CoreNet Global\nEnvironment and Sustainability Award, Victorian Engineering Excellence Awards 2007, Engineers Australia, Victorian Division in association with Lincolne Scott and Bonacci Group\nSustainability Award, IDEA Excellence Awards 2007, (Inside) Australian Design Review in association with DesignInc.\nSire William Hudson Award, Australian Engineering Excellence Awards 2007 Engineers Australia in association with Lincolne Scott and Bonacci Group\nSustainability Building Award (projects under \u00a325,000), Sustainable Building Services Awards UK Chartered Institution of Building Services Engineers (CIBSE) Awarded to Lincolne Scott2010\n\n6 Star \u2013 As Built Rating Certification, Green Star Rating, Green Building Council of Australia\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nSustainable buildings in Australia\nBuilding-integrated renewable energy\nPassive solar building design\nSustainable design\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nCH2 website\nCH2 in Green Star Project Directory, Green Building Council Australia", "infobox": {"name": "Council House 2 (CH<sub>2</sub>)", "image": "CouncilHouse2.jpg", "building_type": "Office", "location": "[[Melbourne, Australia]]", "owner": "[[City of Melbourne]]", "current_tenants": "[[City of Melbourne]]", "start_date": "2004", "completion_date": "2006", "floor_count": "10", "floor_area": "{{convert|12536|m2|sqft|abbr|=|on}}", "main_contractor": "Hansen Yuncken", "architect": "City of Melbourne in association with [[Mick Pearce]] with DesignInc.", "structural_engineer": "Bonacci Group", "services_engineer": "Lincolne Scott", "civil_engineer": "Bonacci Group", "quantity_surveyor": "Donald Cant Watts Corke"}, "wikidata": {"coordinate location (P625)": {"latitude": -37.8142, "longitude": 144.967, "altitude": null, "precision": 0.0001, "globe": "http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q2"}, "country (P17)": "Australia (Q408)", "located in the administrative territorial entity (P131)": "Victoria (Q36687)", "image (P18)": "CouncilHouse2.jpg", "Commons category (P373)": "Council House 2", "instance of (P31)": "green building (Q242606)", "architect (P84)": "Mick Pearce (Q2140435)", "owned by (P127)": "City of Melbourne (Q1919098)", "located on street (P669)": "Little Collins Street (Q14935196)", "date of official opening (P1619)": "+2006-00-00T00:00:00Z", "floors above ground (P1101)": {"amount": "+10", "unit": "1"}, "inception (P571)": "+2006-00-00T00:00:00Z", "Freebase ID (P646)": "/m/03ns6rm"}, "cat": "Building", "url": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Council_House_2"}, {"name": "Indira Paryavaran Bhawan", "url_name": "42071787", "txt": "Indira Paryavaran Bhawan is India\u2019s first on-site net-zero building located in New Delhi, India. The building houses the Ministry of Environment, Forest  and Climate Change (MoEFCC) accommodating three ministers and their offices along with about 600 officials. The building, designed and constructed by the Central Public Works Department (CPWD), was completed in 2013 at a cost of INR 209 Crore.The inauguration of the building, 28 February 2014, was conducted by the then prime minister Dr. Manmohan Singh. The building is rated as a five-star GRIHA (Green Rating for Integrated Habitat Assessment) by MNRE and LEED India Platinum by Indian Green Building Council (IGBC) rating. The building has its own solar power plant, sewage treatment facility, fully automatic robotic multi-level car parking system facility & puzzle parking facility, and geothermal heat exchange system.\n\n\n== Details ==\nIndira Paryavaran Bhawan consists of two blocks within the premises connected through a corridor. Each block is a G+7 storey structure with 3 basements. The total floor area of the campus is 32,000 sq.metre. Each floor consists of office spaces, meeting rooms, conference rooms etc. The building consists of 7 elevators and a central atrium located in between the two blocks.Indira Paryavaran Bhawan is located in a composite climate zone, a mix of hot, dry, humid, and cold climatic conditions, and the design involves multiple active, passive, and renewable strategies to achieve net zero goal. The building is divided into 5 sections: Vayu (Wind), Agni (Fire), Jal (Water), Prithvi (Earth), and Aakash (Space) depicting the 5 elements that all matters are composed of, as per Hinduism. Indira Paryavaran Bhawan is a set example that impinges on society's consciousness towards environmental awareness for adopting green building concepts in India.The Union environment ministry is facing a challenge of a garden variety - bird droppings, soiling the courtyard of Indira Paryavaran Bhawan, which houses it, and is amongst the India\u2019s highest green-rated buildings. Individuals or organizations which will offer the best solution will be awarded an amount of \u20b91 lakh.\n\n\n== Design ==\n\n\n=== Passive Design Strategies ===\n\n\n==== Orientation ====\nThe orientation of the building is set towards north south direction, to accommodate natural daylight and air movement in the building, a central atrium and corridor provide cross ventilation within the building.\n\n\n==== Landscaping and Horticulture ====\nMore than 50% of the area outside the building is covered with plantations, to conserve as many existing trees as possible, out of a total of 79 trees, only 19 trees are cut and 11 trees are transplanted. The pathways and circulation roads in the building are made with grass paver blocks for ground water percolation and ground water recharge. The 7th floor of building also consists of a terrace garden.\n\n\n==== Daylighting and Ventilation ====\nThe building is designed to ensure daylight in more than 75% of the floor space and to reduce dependency on active lighting devices. The central atrium located between the two blocks allows natural movement of air due to stack effect. The provision of windows further enhances the process of cross ventilation.\n\n\n==== Building Envelope and Fenestration ====\nThe building envelope construction comprises heavy weight construction. The external wall consists of 30 cm thick Autoclave Aerated Concrete (AAC) block, 7 cm thick mineral wool insulation, 12 cm thick air gap and 12 cm thick 'Fal-G' [proprietary blend of fly ash (Fa), lime (L) and gypsum (G)] block brick, and has a U-value of .221 W/m2K. The external roof of the building consists of 2 cm thick clay tile, 6 cm thick cement mortar, 4 cm thick PUF insulation, 6 cm thick brick bat coba, 6 cm thick cement mortar,10 cm thick concrete. High reflectance terrace tiles are installed on the building roof for roof cool treatment - low heat ingress, high strength and hard wearing. Windows installed in the building with uPVC (Unplasticized Polyvinyl Chloride) frame are hermetically sealed double glazed with gas filling with a U-Value of 0.26 W/m2K and SHGC of 0.32 and aluminium frame.\n\n\n==== Material and Construction technique ====\nFly ash bricks and heat-insulating Autoclave Aerated Concrete blocks along with fly ash-based mortar and plaster are used for walls. Low energy materials and locally available stones are utilized for flooring. Bamboo jute composite that is rapidly renewable is used for door frames and shutters. Low VOC paints are used to improvise indoor air quality.\n\n\n=== Active Design Strategies ===\n\n\n==== Lighting Design ====\nEnergy efficient lights are provided in the interior and exterior lighting system of the building. To maximize energy efficiency in lighting, the artificial lighting in the building is regulated using a lux-level sensor. The lighting power density is kept close to 5 W/m2 which is 50% more efficient than the Energy Conservation Building Code 2007 requirement (Lighting Power Density = 11 W/m2). The lighting load is supplied by the building integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) power plant.\n\n\n==== Optimized HVAC System ====\nThe building is centrally air conditioned. Chilled beam system technology is used to meet 160 TR air conditioning load of the building. The process of air conditioning happens by convection currents rather than air supply by ducts. The chilled beams are used from second to sixth floor and this system has reduced energy utilization by up to 50% as compared to the conventional system. Integrated building management is utilized to control HVAC equipment and to monitor related systems. For energy efficiency, the room temperature is maintained at 26 \u00b11 \u00b0C.\n\n\n=== Geothermal Heat Exchange System ===\nTo minimize the load on the HVAC system, a vertical closed loop system of geothermal heat exchange system is implemented. This is the first time it has been adopted on a large scale in a government building in India.  The system takes advantage of the difference between the ambient temperature and the temperature below the ground level.The vertical closed loop system consists of 180 vertical bores all over the premises to a depth of 80 meters. A minimum distance of 3 meters between any two bores is retained. Every bore has a 32mm outer diameter HDPE pipe U-loop and is connected in the central air conditioning plant room to the condenser water pipe system. A single U-Loop with a heat rejection capacity of 0.9TR results in a heat rejection capacity of 160TR from 180 vertical bores, resulting in reduction of cooling tower load and subsequent reduction in water consumption.\n\n\n=== Renewable Energy Systems ===\nA building integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) Power Plant has been installed on the entire roof surface of the building and court area. This clean and green renewable energy system has helped in meeting the energy demand of the building to achieve the target of net-zero energy.\n\n\n=== Robotic Car Parking ===\nAutomated parking system is used on all 3 levels of the basement. The first basement is designed for the lobby and puzzle parking system for car entry and exit. The second and third basement floors use robotic dolly parking systems. The capacity for the first basement is 49, the second basement is 126, and the third basement is 170.\n\n\n=== Water Management ===\nThe landscape and horticulture design of planting native species along with efficient irrigation systems are utilized leading up to 50% reduction in water requirement. The remaining water demand is met by recycling and reusing wastewater, and by implementation of rainwater harvesting systems. Additionally, low discharge and efficient water fixtures are installed including sensor urinals and dual flow cisterns.\n\n\n== Savings ==\n\n\n== Awards ==\nThe building has received the following awards.\n\n\n== References ==", "infobox": {"name": "Indira Paryavaran Bhawan", "awards": "[[LEED]] India Platinum, GRIHA 5 Star", "address": "166, [[Jor Bagh metro station|Jor Bagh Road]], Block 17, [[Lodhi Colony]]<br> [[New Delhi]], [[Delhi]] 110003, [[India]]", "start_date": "{{start date and age|January 25, 2011}}", "completion_date": "{{start date and age|October 31, 2013}}", "inauguration_date": "{{start date and age|February 28, 2014}}", "owner": "[[Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change]]", "cost": "[[Indian rupee|INR]]209 [[Crore|Cr]]", "floor_area": "32,000 sq.m", "floor_count": "G+7 (+3 basements floors)", "parking": "330 Cars", "building_type": "Office", "elevator_count": "7", "architecture_firm": "[[Central Public Works Department]]"}, "wikidata": {"coordinate location (P625)": {"latitude": 28.585, "longitude": 77.218, "altitude": null, "precision": 0.010230119887431, "globe": "http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q2"}, "country (P17)": "India (Q668)", "Microsoft Academic ID (P6366)": "2777605325", "Freebase ID (P646)": "/m/0_t_v06"}, "cat": "Building", "url": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indira_Paryavaran_Bhawan"}, {"name": "Pearl River Tower", "url_name": "8102960", "txt": "Pearl River Tower (Chinese: \u73e0\u6c5f\u57ce\u5927\u53a6; pinyin: Zh\u016bji\u0101ng ch\u00e9ng d\u00e0sh\u00e0; or Chinese: \u73e0\u6c5f\u5927\u53a6; pinyin: Zh\u016bji\u0101ng d\u00e0sh\u00e0) is a 71-story, 309.6 m (1,016 ft), clean technology neofuturistic skyscraper at the junction of Jinsui Road/Zhujiang Avenue West, Tianhe District, Guangzhou, China. The tower's architecture and engineering were performed by Skidmore, Owings & Merrill with Adrian D. Smith and Gordon Gill (now at their own firm, AS+GG) as architects. Ground broke on the tower on 8 September 2006 and construction was completed in March 2011. It is intended for office use and is partially occupied by the China National Tobacco Corporation.\n\n\n== Architecture and design ==\nThe design of the Pearl River Tower is intended to minimise harm to the environment and it will extract energy from the natural and passive forces surrounding the building. Major accomplishments are the technological integration of form and function in a holistic approach to engineering and architectural design.\n\n\n=== Sustainability ===\n\n\n==== Energy-Saving Strategies ====\nThere were four steps in the approach to the Pearl River Tower's high-performance design: reduction, absorption, reclamation, and generation. These steps were put in place to achieve the goal of being a zero-energy building.\n1. Reduction \u2013 This includes using low discharge ventilation, daylight responsive controls, radiant cooling, demand-based ventilation, and high-performance glazing.\n2. Absorption \u2013 This includes using wind turbines, daylight responsive controls, and integrated Photovoltaics.\n3. Reclamation \u2013 This stage includes using exhaust air heat recovery and chillers.\n4. Generation \u2013 This final stage works to achieve the objective of being a zero-energy building by creating sufficient energy on-site through the use of microturbines.\n\n\n==== Wind Turbines ====\nThe Pearl River Tower's design enables it to funnel wind through four large wind turbines to generate up to 15 times more energy than regular freestanding turbines.\nAlongside creating the power required for the building to operate, another benefit to this design is that the wind is re-routed through the tower's ventilation system, filtering it through the ceiling and floor spaces throughout the building.  \nAs well as being designed to tunnel the wind in the most efficient way, the tower was built so its widest side faces the direction of the wind, allowing it to capture the most wind possible and thus generate the most energy.Winds in Guangzhou are relatively predictable, coming from the south for 80% of the year and coming from the north for the remaining 20%. This meant that the wind turbines' success could be maximized by considering the building's wind loads. To make the most of the prevailing wind direction, it was essential to place the building's broadest face at a perpendicular angle to the prevailing wind.\n\n\n==== Turbine Usage ====\nThe building was designed to generate power as efficiently as possible. To achieve this goal, the Pearl River Tower was built to direct incoming wind into vents that lead to its turbines. Explicitly sculpted to guide wind into the turbines, this 71-story building works to ensure there is almost always clean energy being generated.\n\n\n==== Cooling ====\nDue to Guangzhou's climate, cooling is an essential part of keeping those within the building comfortable. As the heat increases to higher temperatures in the warmer months, the radiant ceiling system works to cool the office spaces. Another part of the cooling system design is the use of cladding on the broad faces of the building. Using cavities in the walls to trap hot air from the building's exterior, the air runs through the raised floor system and pushes the heat to specific areas where it can be collected and used effectively.\n\n\n==== High-Efficiency Lighting ====\nTo avoid unnecessary energy expenditure, artificial lighting is only used in the building when necessary. When used, the highest-efficiency light bulbs on the market provide lighting for the building without requiring large amounts of electricity to function. The ceiling panels are built in a curved shape to allow the light to be dispersed evenly throughout the rooms, reducing the amount of power needed to light a given space fully.\n\n\n==== Solar Heat ====\nThe Pearl River Tower has advanced double glazing that allows natural light to enter the building. There is a double-skin fa\u00e7ade in place, meaning the walls have two layers: the outer skin has a high permeability for solar heat to allow it in, while the inner skin prevents solar gain. This is referred to as a double curtain wall. There is a ventilation corridor between the two layers. The layers automatically adjust to allow heat in or out as required. The result of this design is that the building is more thermochemically efficient. It helps keep the building at the desired temperature regardless of the weather without using large amounts of energy to pump artificially created hot or cold air into the building.The heat that is trapped between the two skins rises, creating natural ventilation. Initially, the building design aimed to create a positive-energy building, meaning it would generate excess power that could be sold to the electrical grid. Complications with fire codes and regulations resulted in the original design being amended. In its final state, the 212,165m\u00b2 building uses around 40% of the energy that a building of its size would typically use.\n\n\n==== Triple Glazing ====\nThe glass on the exterior of the building has three layers of glazing applied to it. This glazing traps heat within the building, keeping it warmer during the winter. If the heat becomes excessive, it is easily vented out using the tower's built wind-powered ventilation system.\n\n\n==== Photovoltaic Cells ====\nThe shading system on the exterior of the tower has photovoltaic cells incorporated in its design. The purpose of these cells is to absorb solar energy, much like the panels on the top of the tower. This has the effect of increasing the tower's ability to power itself with clean energy by reducing the need for it to draw from the local power grid. This adds to the tower's already considerable power-saving capabilities caused by the wind and solar power used in other parts of the building.\n\n\n==== Reused Heating ====\nWhen coolers are used for air conditioning, the hot water created as a byproduct is then used throughout the building. This reduces water demands and makes the building more sustainable overall.\n\n\n==== Daylight Responsive Blinds ====\nThe blinds on the tower's exterior automatically open or close depending on the building's lighting needs. This maximizes the amount of light inside the building when needed while preventing an excess of light from blinding those insides. This is consistent with other sustainable, efficient aspects of the tower's design, as it prevents excessive artificial light usage and, in turn, prevents unnecessary power draw.\n\n\n=== Influence ===\nThe Pearl River Tower is one of the most environmentally friendly buildings in the world.Of Pearl River Tower\u2019s accomplishments, many are related to the sustainable design features include:\n\nThe largest radiant-cooled office building in the world\nMost energy efficient super-tall building in the world\nThe tower is an example of China\u2019s goal to reduce the intensity of carbon dioxide emissions per unit of GDP in 2020 by 40 to 45 percent as compared to the level of 2005.In a report presented at the 2008 Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat it was reported that the building's sustainable design features will allow a 58% energy usage reduction when compared to similar stand alone buildings.  The building would have been able to be carbon neutral and actually sell power back to the surrounding neighborhood if the micro-turbines had been installed into the building.  However the local power company in Guangzhou does not allow independent energy producers to sell electricity back to the grid.  Without the financial incentive to add the micro-turbines the developers removed them from the design.  If they had been added excess power would have been produced from the building, at the very least, after office hours when the power needed by the building itself had been reduced.\n\n\n=== Timeline ===\nFall 2005 : Design Competition\n8 September  2006 : Ground Breaking Ceremony\nNovember 2006 : Enabling Works begin\n18 July 2007 : Public bidding for the construction\nJanuary 2008 : Main Package construction begins \u221226.2 m (\u221286 ft)\nAugust 2008 : Building Core construction reaches ground level 0 m (0 ft)\nApril 2009 : 15th Level 80.6 m (264 ft)\nNovember 2009: Glass curtainwall installation begins\nDecember 2009: Building reaches upper wind turbine level\n28 March 2010: Topped-out\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nSOM's Pearl River Tower Page\nAS+GG's Pearl River Tower Page\nConsulting Services performed by RWDI", "infobox": {"name": "Pearl River Tower", "native_name": "\u73e0\u6c5f\u57ce\u5927\u53a6", "native_name_lang": "zh", "image": "\u82b1\u57ce\u6c47 \u97f3\u4e50\u55b7\u6cc9 (2013-10-26) - panoramio PRT (cropped).jpg", "image_size": "200px", "image_caption": "Pearl River Tower in October 2013", "alternate_name": "Guangdong Tobacco Building", "location": "Zhujiang Avenue West <br>[[Guangzhou]], [[People's Republic of China|China]]", "coordinates": "{{coord|23.12675|113.3176|region:CN-44|display|=|inline,title}}", "status": "Complete", "start_date": "28 September 2006", "completion_date": "March 2011", "building_type": "Commercial offices", "architectural_style": "[[Neo-futurism]]", "roof": "{{convert|309.6|m|abbr|=|on}}", "floor_count": "71 <small>(+5 basement floors)</small>", "elevator_count": "29", "floor_area": "{{convert|212165|m2|abbr|=|on}}", "architect": "[[Adrian Smith + Gordon Gill Architecture|Gordon Gill]] <br>[[Skidmore, Owings & Merrill]]<br>Guangzhou Chengzong Design Institute", "structural_engineer": "[[Skidmore, Owings & Merrill]]", "main_contractor": "[[Shanghai Construction Group]]", "developer": "Abu Zayyad Holdings .", "owner": "[[China National Tobacco Corporation]]"}, "wikidata": {"Commons category (P373)": "Pearl River Tower", "coordinate location (P625)": {"latitude": 23.12666667, "longitude": 113.3175, "altitude": null, "precision": 0.00027777777777778, "globe": "http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q2"}, "Freebase ID (P646)": "/m/026rkyy", "country (P17)": "People's Republic of China (Q148)", "instance of (P31)": "high-rise building (Q18142)", "architect (P84)": "Adrian Smith + Gordon Gill Architecture (Q4685364)", "image (P18)": "PearlRiverTower Jan.jpg", "structural engineer (P631)": "Skidmore Owings Merrill (Q459464)", "main building contractor (P193)": "Shanghai Construction Group (Q15528181)", "owned by (P127)": "China Tobacco (Q1003789)", "VIAF ID (P214)": "253057722", "CTBUH Skyscraper Center building ID (P1305)": "454", "located in the administrative territorial entity (P131)": "Guangzhou (Q16572)", "Emporis building ID (P455)": "275364", "SkyscraperPage building ID (P1699)": "33679", "number of elevators (P1301)": {"amount": "+29", "unit": "1"}, "Structurae structure ID (P454)": "20058652", "architectural style (P149)": "neo-futurism (Q17012219)", "height (P2048)": {"amount": "+309.6", "unit": "http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q11573"}, "inception (P571)": "+2011-00-00T00:00:00Z", "floors above ground (P1101)": {"amount": "+71", "unit": "1"}, "floors below ground (P1139)": {"amount": "+5", "unit": "1"}}, "cat": "Building", "url": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearl_River_Tower"}, {"name": "Sejong Special Self-Governing City", "url_name": "12178672", "txt": "Sejong (Korean: [\u02c8s\u02b0e\u031e\u02d0d\u0361\u0291o\u014b] (listen); Korean: \uc138\uc885; Hanja: \u4e16\u5b97), officially the Sejong Special Self-Governing City (\uc138\uc885\ud2b9\ubcc4\uc790\uce58\uc2dc; \u4e16\u5b97\u7279\u5225\u81ea\u6cbb\u5e02), is a special self-governing city and de facto administrative capital of South Korea.\nSejong was founded in 2007 as the new planned capital of South Korea from many parts of the South Chungcheong province and some parts of North Chungcheong province to ease congestion in South Korea's current capital and largest city, Seoul, and encourage investment in the country's central region. Since 2012, the government of South Korea has relocated numerous ministries and agencies to Sejong, but many still reside in other cities, primarily Seoul, where the National Assembly and many important government bodies remain.\nSejong has a population of 351,007 as of 2020 and covers a geographic area of 465.23 km2 (179.63 sq mi), making it the least-populous and smallest first-level administrative division in South Korea. Sejong is located in the west-central Hoseo region, bordering South Chungcheong to the west, Daejeon Metropolitan City to the south, and North Chungcheong to the east.\nThe construction of the city should be completed in 2030. In the same year, all government institutions should be moved to Sejong. About 500,000 people are expected to live there in 2030.\n\n\n== Name ==\nSejong was named in honor of King Sejong the Great, the fourth king of the Joseon Dynasty and creator of the Korean alphabet, Hangul. The city was formed by combining Yeongi County, the county of South Chungcheong Province from which the majority of the city's territory was ceded, and other counties.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn 2003, then-President Roh Moo-hyun sought to relocate the national capital of South Korea from the metropolitan city of Seoul to a new multifunctional administrative city in the center of the country. The goal was to reduce the influence and dominance of Seoul on national governance and economics, whilst promoting the regional development of other areas of the country. According to the former Interior Minister Maeng Hyung-gyu in 2012, \"Sejong is a symbol of the country's efforts toward more balanced regional development,\" helping to decongest Seoul and spur investment in the country's central region.\nIn October 2004, the Constitutional Court dealt a setback to President Roh's plans, ruling that the capital must remain in Seoul in response to a complaint filed by the main opposition, the conservative Grand National Party (now Liberty Korea Party). As such, the Roh administration was forced to modify the project to relocate the majority of government ministries and institutions to Sejong, which would become a special administrative city instead of a new capital. The revised plan was approved by the National Assembly in March 2005. Challenges to the new plan were rejected by the Constitutional Court in November 2005.When the Grand National Party retook the presidential office in 2008, then-President Lee Myung-bak opposed the idea of moving government agencies, claiming that it would hurt Seoul's global competitiveness and result in inefficiency. Following Lee's directions, plans were made to make Sejong an industrial, science and education hub instead. This plan was opposed by many, including Roh's allies and some members of the ruling Grand National Party, including Lee's arch-rival and eventual successor, Park Geun-hye. Defeat in the mid-2010 local elections forced Lee to present his proposal to the National Assembly where it was voted down.\nIn July 2012, Sejong Special Self-Governing City was created by combining all of Yeongi County, three townships of Gongju and one township of Cheongwon County.\nIn April 2013, the city government of Putrajaya, Malaysia signed a letter of intent (LOI) with the government of Sejong City to mark cooperation between the two planned capitals.As of 2019, 12 ministries were relocated to the city. As such, only 5 ministries continue to remain in Seoul; the Ministry Of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Unification, Ministry of Justice, Ministry of National Defense, and Ministry of Gender Equality and Family.Sejong was specifically designed to be a \"smart city\", and is sometimes referred to as Sejong smart city. It is the leading smart city in Korea, and is often held up as the standard for other cities experimenting with the development of smart city infrastructure.By 2019, there was disagreement among experts as to whether Sejong had \"lived up to expectations. ...Sejong uses its new development to market itself as an alternative to Seoul, offering luxury living at a fraction of the cost. It boasts shiny state-of-the-art condominiums, ample public green space and smart and sustainable city tech, like automated trash collection and zero-waste food disposal, electric car charging and sharing stations, solar-powered buildings, interactive digital signage, closed-circuit television security and fine dust emergency alerts.

Since 2012, the government of South Korea has relocated numerous ministries and agencies to Sejong, but many still reside in other cities, primarily Seoul, where the National Assembly and many important government bodies remain.\nSejong has a population of 351,007 as of 2020 and covers a geographic area of 465.23 km2 (179.63 sq mi), making it the least-populous and smallest first-level administrative division in South Korea. Sejong is located in the west-central Hoseo region, bordering South Chungcheong to the west, Daejeon Metropolitan City to the south, and North Chungcheong to the east.\nThe construction of the city should be completed in 2030. In the same year, all government institutions should be moved to Sejong. About 500,000 people are expected to live there in 2030.\n\n\n== Name ==\nSejong was named in honor of King Sejong the Great, the fourth king of the Joseon Dynasty and creator of the Korean alphabet, Hangul. The city was formed by combining Yeongi County, the county of South Chungcheong Province from which the majority of the city's territory was ceded, and other counties.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn 2003, then-President Roh Moo-hyun sought to relocate the national capital of South Korea from the metropolitan city of Seoul to a new multifunctional administrative city in the center of the country. The goal was to reduce the influence and dominance of Seoul on national governance and economics, whilst promoting the regional development of other areas of the country. According to the former Interior Minister Maeng Hyung-gyu in 2012, \"Sejong is a symbol of the country's efforts toward more balanced regional development,\" helping to decongest Seoul and spur investment in the country's central region.\nIn October 2004, the Constitutional Court dealt a setback to President Roh's plans, ruling that the capital must remain in Seoul in response to a complaint filed by the main opposition, the conservative Grand National Party (now Liberty Korea Party). As such, the Roh administration was forced to modify the project to relocate the majority of government ministries and institutions to Sejong, which would become a special administrative city instead of a new capital. The revised plan was approved by the National Assembly in March 2005. Challenges to the new plan were rejected by the Constitutional Court in November 2005.When the Grand National Party retook the presidential office in 2008, then-President Lee Myung-bak opposed the idea of moving government agencies, claiming that it would hurt Seoul's global competitiveness and result in inefficiency. Following Lee's directions, plans were made to make Sejong an industrial, science and education hub instead. This plan was opposed by many, including Roh's allies and some members of the ruling Grand National Party, including Lee's arch-rival and eventual successor, Park Geun-hye. Defeat in the mid-2010 local elections forced Lee to present his proposal to the National Assembly where it was voted down.\nIn July 2012, Sejong Special Self-Governing City was created by combining all of Yeongi County, three townships of Gongju and one township of Cheongwon County.\nIn April 2013, the city government of Putrajaya, Malaysia signed a letter of intent (LOI) with the government of Sejong City to mark cooperation between the two planned capitals.As of 2019, 12 ministries were relocated to the city. As such, only 5 ministries continue to remain in Seoul; the Ministry Of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Unification, Ministry of Justice, Ministry of National Defense, and Ministry of Gender Equality and Family.Sejong was specifically designed to be a \"smart city\", and is sometimes referred to as Sejong smart city. It is the leading smart city in Korea, and is often held up as the standard for other cities experimenting with the development of smart city infrastructure.By 2019, there was disagreement among experts as to whether Sejong had \"lived up to expectations. ...Sejong uses its new development to market itself as an alternative to Seoul, offering luxury living at a fraction of the cost. It boasts shiny state-of-the-art condominiums, ample public green space and smart and sustainable city tech, like automated trash collection and zero-waste food disposal, electric car charging and sharing stations, solar-powered buildings, interactive digital signage, closed-circuit television security and fine dust emergency alerts. [It] has sparked criticism that the new city is not only too lackluster to draw residents away from Seoul, but also difficult to access and poorly designed.\"\n\n\n== Geography ==\nSejong is surrounded by the two provinces of Chungcheongnam-do, and Chungcheongbuk-do, as well as the metropolitan city of Daejeon.

It has no historical relation to the modern republic of Benin, which was historically known as Dahomey from the 17th century until 1975. The Kingdom of Benin's capital was Edo, now known as Benin City in Edo state, Nigeria. The Benin Kingdom was \"one of the oldest and most developed states in the coastal hinterland of West Africa\". It was formed out of the previous Edo Kingdom of Igodomigodo around the 11th century AD, and lasted until it was annexed by the British Empire in 1897.\n\n\n== Oral traditions ==\nThe original people and founders of the Benin Kingdom, the Edo people, were initially ruled by the Ogiso (Kings of the Sky) who called their land Igodomigodo. The first Ogiso (Ogiso Igodo), wielded much influence and gained popularity as a good ruler. He died after a long reign and was succeeded by Ere, his eldest son. In the 12th century, a great palace intrigue erupted and crown prince Ekaladerhan, the only son of the last Ogiso, was sentenced to death as a result of the first queen (who was barren) deliberately changing an oracle's message to the Ogiso. In carrying out the royal order that he be killed, the palace messengers had mercy and set the prince free at Ughoton near Benin. When his father the Ogiso died, the Ogiso dynasty officially ended. The people and royal kingmakers preferred their late king's son as the next to rule.\n\nThe exiled Prince Ekaladerhan had by this time changed his name to Izoduwa (meaning 'I have chosen the path of prosperity') and found his way to Ile-Ife. It was during this period of confusion in Benin that the elders, led by Chief Oliha, mounted a search for the banished Prince Ekaladerhan \u2013 whom the Ile-Ife people now called Oduduwa. Oduduwa, who could not return due to his advanced age, granted them Oranmiyan, his grandson, to rule over them. Oranmiyan was resisted by Ogiamien Irebor, one of the palace chiefs, and took up his abode in the palace built for him at Usama by the elders (now a coronation shrine). Soon after his arrival, he married a beautiful lady, Erinmwinde, daughter of Ogie-Egor, the ninth Enogie of Egor, by whom he had a son. After residing there for some years he called a meeting of the people and renounced his office, remarking in vexation Ile-Ibinu (\"ile\" means land, \"binu\" mean anger, and thus the kingdom was called Ibinu, which was mispronounced Bini in the 15th and 16th centuries by the Portuguese). This was out of frustration as he often expressed that \"only a child born, trained and educated in the arts and mysteries of the land could reign over the people\". He arranged for his son born to him by Erinmwinde, Eweka, to be made king in his place, and returned to Yorubaland thereafter. His son the new king was soon found to be deaf and mute, and so the elders appealed to Oranmiyan. He gave them charmed seeds known as \"omo ayo\" to play with, saying that to do so will make him talk. The little Eweka played with the seeds with his peers at Useh near egor, his mother's hometown. While playing with the seeds, he announced \"Owomika\" as his royal name. Thus, he gave rise to the tradition of the subsequent Obas of Benin spending seven days and nights at Usama before proceeding to announce their royal names at Useh. Eweka thus started a dynasty that now bears his name. Oranmiyan went on to serve as the founder of the Oyo Empire, where he ruled as the first Alaafin of Oyo. His descendants now rule in Ile Ife, Oyo and Benin.By the 15th century, Benin had expanded into a thriving city-state. The twelfth Oba in the line, Oba Ewuare the Great (1440\u20131473) would expand the city-state's territories to surrounding regions.It was not until the 15th century, during the reign of Oba Ewuare the Great, that the kingdom's administrative centre, the city of Ubinu (or Ibinu), began to be known as Benin City by the Portuguese, a pronunciation later adopted by the locals as well. The Portuguese would write this down as Benin City. Edo's neighbours, such as the Itsekiris and the Urhobos, continued to refer to the city as Ubini up until the late 19th century.Aside from Benin City, the system of rule of the Oba in the empire, even through the golden age of the kingdom, was still loosely based upon the Ogiso dynasty's tradition, which was military protection in exchange for pledged allegiance and taxes paid to the royal administrative centre. The language and culture was not enforced, as the empire remained heterogeneous and localized according to each group within the kingdom, though a local enogie (or duke) was often appointed by the Oba for specific ethnic areas.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\nBy the 1st century BC, the Benin territory was partially agricultural; and it became primarily agricultural by around 500 AD, but hunting and gathering still remained important. Also by 500 AD, iron was in use by the inhabitants of the Benin territory.Benin City (formerly Edo) sprang up by around 1000, in a forest that could be easily defended. The dense vegetation and narrow paths made the city easy to defend against attacks. The rainforest, which Benin City is situated in, helped in the development of the city because of its vast resources \u2013 fish from rivers and creeks, animals to hunt, leaves for roofing, plants for medicine, ivory for carving and trading, and wood for boat building \u2013 that could be exploited. However, domesticated animals, from the forest and surrounding areas, could not survive, due to a disease spread by tsetse flies; after centuries of exposure, some animals, such as cattle and goats, developed a resistance to the disease.The original name of the kingdom of Benin, at its creation some time in the first millennium CE, was Igodomigodo, as its inhabitants called it. Their ruler was called Ogiso \u2013 the ruler of the sky. Nearly 36 known Ogiso are accounted for as rulers of this initial incarnation of the state.\n\n\n=== Architecture ===\n\nThe Walls of Benin are a series of earthworks made up of banks and ditches, called Iya in the Edo language in the area around present-day Benin City, the capital of present-day Edo, Nigeria. They consist of 15 kilometres (9.3 miles) of city iya and an estimated 16,000 kilometres (9,900 miles)  in the rural area around Benin. Some estimates suggest that the walls of Benin may have been constructed between the thirteenth and mid-fifteenth century CE and others suggest that the walls of Benin (in the Esan region) may have been constructed during the first millennium AD.\n\n\n=== History ===\n\n\n==== First Encounters and Records ====\nThe Benin City walls have been known to Westerners since around 1500. Around 1500, the Portuguese explorer Duarte Pacheco Pereira, briefly described the walls during his travels. Another description given around 1600, one hundred years after Pereira's description, is by the Dutch explorer Dierick Ruiters.Pereira's account of the walls is as follows:\n\nThis city is about a league long from gate to gate; it has no wall but is surrounded by a large moat, very wide and deep, which suffices for its defence.\nThe archaeologist Graham Connah suggests that Pereira was mistaken with his description by saying that there was no wall. Connah says, \"[Pereira] considered that a bank of earth was not a wall in the sense of the Europe of his day.\"Ruiters' account of the walls is as follows:\n\nAt the gate where I entered on horseback, I saw a very high bulwark, very thick of earth, with a very deep broad ditch, but it was dry, and full of high trees... That gate is a reasonable good gate, made of wood in their manner, which is to be shut, and there always there is watch holden.\n\n\n==== Construction ====\nEstimates for the initial construction of the walls range from the first millennium to the mid-fifteenth century.  According to Connah, oral tradition and travelers' accounts suggest a construction date of 1450\u20131500. It has been estimated that, assuming a ten-hour work day, a labour force of 5,000 men could have completed the walls within 97 days, or by 2,421 men in 200 days. However, these estimates have been criticized for not taking into account the time it would have taken to extract earth from an ever deepening hole and the time it would have taken to heap the earth into a high bank. It is unknown whether slavery or some other type of labour was used in the construction of the walls.\n\n\n==== Description ====\n\nThe walls were built of a ditch and dike structure; the ditch dug to form an inner moat with the excavated earth used to form the exterior rampart.\nThe Benin Walls were partially demolished by the British in 1897 during their 1897 punitive expedition. Scattered pieces of the structure remain in Edo, with the vast majority of them being used by the locals for building purposes. What remains of the wall itself continues to be torn down for real estate developments in Nigeria.Fred Pearce wrote in New Scientist:", "infobox": {"native_name": "''Edo''", "conventional_long_name": "Kingdom of Benin", "common_name": "Benin Kingdom", "government_type": "[[Monarchy]]", "year_start": "1180", "year_end": "1897", "event_end": "Annexed by the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]]", "p1": "Igodomigodo", "flag_p1": "Transparent_flag_with_question_mark.png", "s1": "Southern Nigeria Protectorate", "flag_s1": "Flag of the Southern Nigeria Protectorate (1900\u20131914).svg", "image_map": "Benin 1625 locator.png", "image_map_caption": "The extent of Benin in 1625", "capital": "Edo<br/>(now [[Benin City]])", "common_languages": "[[Edo language|Edo]]", "leader1": "Eweka I", "leader2": "[[Ewuare]] (1440\u20131473)", "leader3": "[[Ovonramwen]] (exile 1897)", "leader4": "[[Erediauwa I]] (post-imperial)", "leader5": "[[Ewuare II]] (post-imperial)", "year_leader1": "1180\u20131246", "year_leader2": "1440\u20131473", "year_leader4": "1978\u20132016", "year_leader5": "2016\u2013", "title_leader": "[[Oba of Benin#List of Obas of the Benin Empire|King (Oba)]]", "today": "[[Nigeria]]"}, "wikidata": {"Commons category (P373)": "Benin Empire", "Freebase ID (P646)": "/m/02wqgm", "inception (P571)": "+1170-01-01T00:00:00Z", "dissolved, abolished or demolished date (P576)": "+1897-01-01T00:00:00Z", "instance of (P31)": ["historical country (Q3024240)", "traditional state in Nigeria (Q18920569)", "realm (Q1250464)", "polity (Q1063239)"], "coordinate location (P625)": {"latitude": 6.31667, "longitude": 5.6, "altitude": null, "precision": 9.0380227988515, "globe": "http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q2"}, "notable work (P800)": "Benin Bronzes (Q248101)", "Encyclop\u00e6dia Universalis ID (P3219)": "royaume-du-benin", "ASC Leiden Thesaurus ID (P5198)": "294901272", "country (P17)": "Nigeria (Q1033)", "continent (P30)": "Africa (Q15)", "image (P18)": ["Benin kingdom Louvre A97-4-1.jpg", "Benin bronze Louvre A97-14-1.jpg"], "Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Online ID (P1417)": "place/Benin-historical-kingdom-West-Africa", "Great Russian Encyclopedia Online ID (P2924)": "1875342", "BlackPast.org ID (P6723)": "global-african-history/benin", "Gran Enciclop\u00e8dia Catalana ID (P1296)": "0009253", "NKCR AUT ID (P691)": "ge484444", "described by source (P1343)": "The Nuttall Encyclop\u00e6dia (Q3181656)", "Treccani's Dizionario di Storia ID (P6404)": "regno-del-benin", "flag image (P41)": "Unidentified West African flag.svg", "language used (P2936)": "Yoruba (Q34311)", "locator map image (P242)": "Benin 1625 locator.png", "Larousse ID (P6058)": "autre-region/wd/98869", "capital (P36)": "Benin City (Q320704)", "Grove Art Online ID (P8406)": "T007886", "iDAI.gazetteer ID (P8217)": "2379015", "GND ID (P227)": "4069261-9", "Getty Thesaurus of Geographic Names ID (P1667)": "8711681", "museum-digital place ID (P9957)": "5375", "World History Encyclopedia ID (P9000)": "Kingdom_of_Benin"}, "cat": "City", "url": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Benin"}, {"name": "Benin Kingdom", "url_name": "25649488", "txt": "The Kingdom of Benin (also known as the Edo Kingdom, or the Benin Empire) was a kingdom in what is now in southwestern  Nigeria.

What remains of the wall itself continues to be torn down for real estate developments in Nigeria.Fred Pearce wrote in New Scientist:", "infobox": {"native_name": "''Edo''", "conventional_long_name": "Kingdom of Benin", "common_name": "Benin Kingdom", "government_type": "[[Monarchy]]", "year_start": "1180", "year_end": "1897", "event_end": "Annexed by the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]]", "p1": "Igodomigodo", "flag_p1": "Transparent_flag_with_question_mark.png", "s1": "Southern Nigeria Protectorate", "flag_s1": "Flag of the Southern Nigeria Protectorate (1900\u20131914).svg", "image_map": "Benin 1625 locator.png", "image_map_caption": "The extent of Benin in 1625", "capital": "Edo<br/>(now [[Benin City]])", "common_languages": "[[Edo language|Edo]]", "leader1": "Eweka I", "leader2": "[[Ewuare]] (1440\u20131473)", "leader3": "[[Ovonramwen]] (exile 1897)", "leader4": "[[Erediauwa I]] (post-imperial)", "leader5": "[[Ewuare II]] (post-imperial)", "year_leader1": "1180\u20131246", "year_leader2": "1440\u20131473", "year_leader4": "1978\u20132016", "year_leader5": "2016\u2013", "title_leader": "[[Oba of Benin#List of Obas of the Benin Empire|King (Oba)]]", "today": "[[Nigeria]]"}, "wikidata": {"Commons category (P373)": "Benin Empire", "Freebase ID (P646)": "/m/02wqgm", "inception (P571)": "+1170-01-01T00:00:00Z", "dissolved, abolished or demolished date (P576)": "+1897-01-01T00:00:00Z", "instance of (P31)": ["historical country (Q3024240)", "traditional state in Nigeria (Q18920569)", "realm (Q1250464)", "polity (Q1063239)"], "coordinate location (P625)": {"latitude": 6.31667, "longitude": 5.6, "altitude": null, "precision": 9.0380227988515, "globe": "http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q2"}, "notable work (P800)": "Benin Bronzes (Q248101)", "Encyclop\u00e6dia Universalis ID (P3219)": "royaume-du-benin", "ASC Leiden Thesaurus ID (P5198)": "294901272", "country (P17)": "Nigeria (Q1033)", "continent (P30)": "Africa (Q15)", "image (P18)": ["Benin kingdom Louvre A97-4-1.jpg", "Benin bronze Louvre A97-14-1.jpg"], "Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Online ID (P1417)": "place/Benin-historical-kingdom-West-Africa", "Great Russian Encyclopedia Online ID (P2924)": "1875342", "BlackPast.org ID (P6723)": "global-african-history/benin", "Gran Enciclop\u00e8dia Catalana ID (P1296)": "0009253", "NKCR AUT ID (P691)": "ge484444", "described by source (P1343)": "The Nuttall Encyclop\u00e6dia (Q3181656)", "Treccani's Dizionario di Storia ID (P6404)": "regno-del-benin", "flag image (P41)": "Unidentified West African flag.svg", "language used (P2936)": "Yoruba (Q34311)", "locator map image (P242)": "Benin 1625 locator.png", "Larousse ID (P6058)": "autre-region/wd/98869", "capital (P36)": "Benin City (Q320704)", "Grove Art Online ID (P8406)": "T007886", "iDAI.gazetteer ID (P8217)": "2379015", "GND ID (P227)": "4069261-9", "Getty Thesaurus of Geographic Names ID (P1667)": "8711681", "museum-digital place ID (P9957)": "5375", "World History Encyclopedia ID (P9000)": "Kingdom_of_Benin"}, "cat": "City", "url": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Benin"}, {"name": "Smart City", "url_name": "9204352", "txt": "SmartCity is a technology park under development in Kalkara, Malta. The original plan was to transform the Ricasoli Industrial Estate into an information technology and media city on the models of Dubai Internet City and Dubai Media City. The project was unveiled on 10 September 2007 by then Prime Minister of Malta, Lawrence Gonzi. The project was estimated to cost at least \u20ac275 million. The whole development, which covers an area of 360,000 square metres, was planned to be fully completed in 2021, although the first offices opened in 2010.In May 2018, it was revealed that Malta Properties Company was in talks with SmartCity (Dubai) to acquire its majority shareholding in SmartCity (Malta).  In June 2018 the Planning Authority announced that it was considering changes to the master plan for the rezoning of certain areas for residential development, possibly indicating that the project for an ICT village was being abandoned and replaced with plans for a residential area.\n\n\n== Outline planning ==\n\nOn 23 April 2008 it was announced that the decision by SmartCity Malta to allocate more space for its business park meant that this park would employ more than 8,500 people, when the agreed figure for employment there had been 3,000. Smart City Malta, would have the space to employ 11,000, making it one of the biggest economic concentrations in Malta.\nSmartCity Malta formally submitted its outline planning application for the development at Ricasoli to the Malta Environment and Planning Authority (Mepa) on 29 April 2008. The submission includes a full Environmental Impact Assessment and Traffic Impact Assessment. SmartCity Malta has applied for up to 158,500 square metres of business space, which represents an increase of 54 per cent over the business space which Smart City Malta is contractually bound to develop. On the other hand, the gross floor area of the residential component has been reduced by 30 per cent, down to 60,000 square metres. In terms of the Outline Planning Application, the residential component makes up 19 per cent of the total gross floor area of the project.The application also provides for a huge public open space of 118,000 square metres, to serve as a primary recreational area for neighbouring communities. The energy requirements for Smart City Malta will be of 41.2MW.SmartCity Malta has been allocated a budget of \u20ac48 million for 2010. SmartCity has also drawn up plans to market the project in China, Japan, Korea, Australia and Egypt.In June 2018 the Planning Authority announced that it was considering changes to the master plan for the rezoning of certain areas for residential development. In a separate report, the Environment and Resources Authority stated that \"the development of Smart City was proceeding at a much slower rate than was envisaged.\u201d  This announcement coincided with reports that Malta Properties Company was in talks with SmartCity (Dubai) for the acquisition of the latter's majority shareholding in SmartCity (Malta). \n\n\n== Plans for Residential Units ==\nIn June 2017, it was reported that real estate agents were advertising high-end residential apartments within the SmartCity site, even though the master plan and the permits issued by the Planning Authority did not feature any permits for residential units.  In June 2018 it was confirmed that the Planning Authority was considering changes to the master plans for drastic increases to the height limitations, and rezoning of certain areas for residential development. \n\n\n== Commercial Space ==\nThe commercial space, more specifically, the Office Blocks have been developed in such a way as to meet the most stringent industry demands for companies who rely on data as a core part of their business with numerous layers of redundancy to ensure maximum levels of business continuity.\nThe SmartCity campus is managed through the Central Campus Management System (CCMS) and is monitored and secured 24/7.  Thermal comfort and Air Quality control is maintained through the use of HVAC systems that provide office tenants a filtered and controlled environmental experience.  Lighting is handled using an Intelligent BMS (Building Management System), which results in substantial cost saving and presents itself as a greener approach for lighting solutions.\n\n\n== See also ==\nSmart City\nDubai Media City\nDubai Internet City\nSmart City, Kochi\nMalta\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Sources ===\nSmart City / Smart city\nSmart City Offices\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial Website\nTECOM", "infobox": {"name": "Smart City", "logo": "Logo smart.JPG", "logo_size": "150px", "type": "ICT and media park", "genre": "Infrastructure Service Provider", "foundation": "10 September 2007", "founder": "TECOM Investments and Sama Dubai", "location_city": "[[Kalkara]]", "location_country": "Malta", "industry": "[[Information Technology]] [[Business Park]]", "homepage": "[http://www.smartcity.ae/Malta/index.php smartcity.ae/Malta]"}, "wikidata": {"instance of (P31)": "business (Q4830453)", "country (P17)": "Malta (Q233)", "headquarters location (P159)": "Kalkara (Q533257)", "official website (P856)": "http://www.smartcity.ae/Malta/index.php?MenuID=108", "inception (P571)": "+2007-09-10T00:00:00Z", "industry (P452)": "information technology (Q11661)", "Freebase ID (P646)": "/m/02805md"}, "cat": "City", "url": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SmartCity_Malta"}, {"name": "Fortifications of Qu\u00e9bec National Historic Site", "url_name": "16364038", "txt": "The ramparts of Quebec City is a city wall that surrounds the western end of Old Quebec's Upper Town in Quebec City, Quebec, Canada. The ramparts date back to the 17th century, with the ramparts having undergone a succession of modifications and improvements throughout its history. The city walls extends 4.6 kilometres (2.9 mi), with the southern portions of the ramparts forming a part of the Citadelle of Quebec.\nThe ramparts were first built in 1690 in order to defend the Upper Town of Quebec City. In 1745, the walls were rebuilt further west, modelled after designs created by Gaspard-Joseph Chaussegros de L\u00e9ry. The ramparts withstood several sieges during the mid-18th century, with British forces holding out in the walled city during the French siege of Quebec in 1760, and the American siege of Quebec in 1775. From the 1820s to 1830s, the British expanded and improved the ramparts and the rest of the city's defensive network. However, by the late-19th century, several deteriorating facilities associated with Quebec City's fortifications were demolished, although the primary defences remained. In 1948, the ramparts were designated as a part of the larger Fortifications of Qu\u00e9bec National Historic Site. The fortifications, alongside the rest of Old Quebec, were designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1985; with the area serving as the only intact example of a fortified colonial settlement in North America north of Mexico.  \n\n\n== History ==\nConstruction of makeshift fortifications for Quebec City began shortly after its settlement by the French in 1608. The initial settlement, the Habitation de Qu\u00e9bec, included a trading post, residence and a redoubt with elevated walls. From 1620 to 1665, a series of rudimentary fortifications were built to defend the city.The city's first real defensive walls were erected shortly after Port Royal fell to the British in 1690. The city walls were completed prior to the Battle of Quebec in 1690. Work on an improved enceinte took place several years later in 1693. The enceinte was built around the city, made up of 11 redoubts joined by palisades. As most of the Quebec's Upper Town was situated along the steep cliffs of Cap Diamant, fortifying the western periphery of Upper Town, facing the Plains of Abraham, was given priority.A succession of modifications and additions were made to the fortifications until 1745. After the Fortress of Louisbourg fell to the British in 1745, the residents of Quebec City went into panic, resulting in Fran\u00e7ois de Beauharnois de la Chaussaye, Baron de Beauville, the Governor General of New France, to order the construction of a new masonry-laden enceinte without approval from France. The new enceinte was modelled after designs from Gaspard-Joseph Chaussegros de L\u00e9ry, and was built further west than the original enceinte in order to accommodate urban growth in Upper Town.\n\nHowever, several flaws were evident in the 1745-design, with the rampart's flanks being exposed against several high points further west of the city, and its hasty construction in the midst of a panic over a potential attack. The condition of the ramparts were in bad repair by 1759, with French commanders making note of its condition prior to the Battle of the Plains of Abraham. The condition of the ramparts was partly what led General Louis-Joseph de Montcalm to assemble his forces outside the walled city on the Plains of Abraham to meet the British; which resulted in the capitulation of Quebec. The city's ramparts were used by the British forces in the following year, allowing them to hold out against a French siege in 1760 until reinforcements arrived by sea. The ramparts were used again fifteen years later, when soldiers of the British Army and the Canadian militia held off another siege in 1775 by American forces.Although British officials in Quebec raised several concerns about improving the city's fortifications, little work was done to the ramparts in the initial decades of British-rule; with the British only making necessary preservation works to the ramparts. The American Revolutionary War sparked a renewed interest in improving the city's defences, with a series of wood and earth works formed along the redoubt and heights of Cap Diamond; acting as a temporary citadel. New designs that recognized the strategic importance the 1745 ramparts were later created by Gother Mann. The plans included the extension of the 1745 ramparts along with several outworks added to its walls, a citadel on Cap Diamant, and several defensive works in the Plains of Abraham. Construction based on these designs was started 1820; with most of the plan being realized barring several alterations. Repairs to the existing enceinte and five new powder magazines were also built along the fortifications. Work on the expansion plan was not completed until the late 1830s, with the completion of the Citadelle of Quebec.\n\nApproximately 300 cannon pieces were placed around the rampart in 1837. During the mid-19th century, the military's interest in maintaining the fortifications often conflicted with the developmental interests of the city. When British forces withdrew from the city in 1871, a number of sites were demolished to make way for new developments, including the old military gates of the ramparts. \nSeveral structures of the deteriorated city fortifications were demolished during the late-19th century, although the primary defences of the city remained after the Governor General of Canada, Lord Dufferin, intervened in order to preserve the ramparts.On 25 May 1948, the ramparts of Quebec City, along with several buildings and structures associated with Quebec's defences were designated as a National Historic Site of Canada. The ramparts, along with the rest of Old Quebec were designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1985; with Old Quebec being the only intact example of a fortified walled colonial settlement in North America north of Mexico.\n\n\n== Design and layout ==\nThe ramparts of Quebec City are situated atop Cap Diamont, a large promontory in the city. The ramparts encircled the western portions of the Upper Town of Old Quebec, with the other sides of the Upper Town protected by steep cliffs with a 90-metre-drop (300 ft). The total length of the ramparts is approximately 4.6 kilometres (2.9 mi). Initially built in the 17th century, the walls were rebuilt in 1745 by the French and improved and extended during the 1820s and 1830s by the British.\n\nWood and green sandstone quarried from the borough of Sillery make up a significant portion of the materials used to build the fortifications.  An underground artillery battery was built into the ramparts during the 1750s, referred to as the flank blockhouse. The underground battery was built to reinforce the portion of the ramparts thought to be the weakest by doubling the available firepower around that point. Its embrasures are presently exposed at the Citadelle. Small openings that pierce the wall allowed people to travel to the outworks when the city gates were closed.The ramparts of Quebec City forms a part of the Fortifications of Qu\u00e9bec National Historic Site of Canada, which is made up of several sites associated with the historic defences for the city\u2019s Upper Town and Lower Town; along the north shore of the Saint Lawrence River to the Montmorency River in the borough of Beauport. Other sites related to the national historic site also exist on the south shore of the river in L\u00e9vis. These sites include the actual ramparts in addition to other supporting components, such as barracks, guard posts, magazines, Martello towers, and storehouses; such as the Esplanade powder magazine, the powder magazine located on H\u00f4tel-Dieu de Qu\u00e9bec's property, the Dauphin redoubt, the L\u00e9vis Forts, and the Citadelle of Quebec. In particular, portions of the Citadelle of Quebec are integrated with the rest of the city's ramparts. All the sites date from 1608 to 1871. At one point, the depth of the defensive works surrounding Upper Town was 75-metre-wide (246 ft) when factoring its the city walls, ditches, outworks, and the glacis. However, the depth of this defensive network was later reduced in order to accommodate developments to the west of the city walls.\n\n\n=== City gates ===\nThere are four main city gates built into the ramparts that provide access to Old Quebec's Upper Town including Kent Gate, Prescott Gate, Saint-Jean Gate, and Saint-Louis Gate. During the mid-18th century, the ramparts had three city gates, although several other gates were later built in the mid-19th centuries. However the demolition of two city gates, Palace Gate and Hope Gate in the 19th century left the ramparts with a total of four city gates. Plans were in place to demolish the Saint-Jean and Saint-Louis gates in 1871, although intervention from Lord Dufferin prevented their demolition.Kent Gate was erected in 1879 was and was named after Queen Victoria's father Prince Edward Augustus, Duke of Kent and Strathearn. Prescott Gate was a gate whose location dates back to 1797. Prescott Gate was rebuilt twice, in 1871, and again in 1983. The gate is named was named by and after Robert Prescott.\n\nRue St-Jean runs through Saint-Jean Gate, whose present location dates back to 1770. The original location of Saint-Jean Gate was further east on Rue St-Jean, and was erected in 1693 where the ramparts were located at that time. The gate was rebuilt at its present location in 1770, although were demolished and rebuilt in 1865. From 1770 to 1871, the gate doors were closed at night, disrupting local trade. The doors were later removed in 1871 permitting the free flow of traffic into the Upper Town on Rue St. Jean. The gates were rebuilt again in 1939, in an effort to make the gate better resemble the design of Kent Gate and Saint-Louis Gate.Saint-Louis Gate is built on rue Saint-Louis whose location dates to the late 17th century. However, the present gate was built in 1878, to replace the older gate with one more \"aesthetically pleasing\". Like Saint-Jean Gate, the doors of Saint-Louis Gate were closed at night, disrupting local traffic until they were permanently removed in 1871.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of cities with defensive walls\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nCarbonneau, Andr\u00e9; Desloges, Yvon; Lafrance, Marc (1982).

Spanish pronunciation: [sju\u02c8\u00f0a\u00f0 \u02c8xwa\u027ees] (listen)) is the  most populous city in the Mexican state of Chihuahua. It is commonly referred to as Ju\u00e1rez and was known as El Paso del Norte (The Pass of the North) until 1888. Ju\u00e1rez is the seat of the Ju\u00e1rez Municipality with an estimated population of 1.5 million people. It lies on the Rio Grande (R\u00edo Bravo del Norte) river, south of El Paso, Texas, United States. Together with the surrounding areas, the cities form El Paso\u2013Ju\u00e1rez, the second largest binational metropolitan area on the Mexico\u2013U.S. border (after San Diego\u2013Tijuana), with a combined population of over 2.7 million people.Four international points of entry connect Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez and El Paso: the Bridge of the Americas, the Ysleta\u2013Zaragoza International Bridge, the Paso del Norte Bridge, and the Stanton Street Bridge. Combined, these bridges allowed 22,958,472 crossings in 2008, making Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez a major point of entry and transportation into the U.S. for all of central northern Mexico. The city has a growing industrial center, which in large part is made up by more than 300 \"maquiladoras\" (assembly plants) located in and around the city. According to a 2007 New York Times article, Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez was \"absorbing more new industrial real estate space than any other North American city\". In 2008, fDi Magazine designated Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez \"The City of the Future\".\n\n\n== History ==\n\nAs 17th century Spanish explorers sought a route through the southern Rocky Mountains, the Franciscan Friar Garc\u00eda de San Francisco founded Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez in 1659 as \"El Paso del Norte\" (\"The North Pass\"). The Misi\u00f3n de Guadalupe de los Mansos en el Paso del r\u00edo del Norte became the first permanent Spanish development in the area in the 1660s, although Native American peoples were already present. The Franciscan friars established a community that grew in importance as commerce between Santa Fe and Chihuahua passed through it. The wood for the first bridge across the Rio Grande came from Santa Fe, New Mexico in the late 18th century. The original population of Mansos, Suma, Jumano, and other natives from the south brought by the Spanish from Central New Spain grew around the mission. In 1680 during the Pueblo Revolt, most of the Piro Pueblo and some of the Tiwa people branch of the Pueblo became refugees, A Mission was established for the Tigua in Ysleta del Sur. Piro Pueblo colonial era settlements along El Camino Real, south of the Guadalupe Mission, included Missions Real de San Lorenzo, Senec\u00fa del Sur, and Soccoro del Sur. Presidio del Nuestra Senora del Pilar del Paso del Rio Norte was established near the Mission in 1683.:\u200a39\u201396\u200aThe population of the entire district was close to 5,000 in 1750 when the Apache attacked the other native towns and ranchos around the missions. Additional Presidios were established to counter them. One Presidio, San Elzeario, was established near El Porvenir in 1774, where it remained until being moved in 1788 to what is now San Elizario, Texas where that settlement grew up around that Presidio. Another was Presidio de San Fernando de Carrizal, which was established in 1774 at the San Fernando settlement that became present-day Carrizal, Chihuahua.:\u200a39\u201340\u200aThe 1848 Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo established the Rio Grande as the border between Mexico and the United States. The main channel of the Rio Grande had moved southwestward leaving the settlements of Ysleta, Socorro, and San Elzeario on the Camino Real on the north bank of the river, isolated from the rest of the towns, in Texas.\n\nOther settlements on the east bank of the Rio Grande were not part of a town at that time; as the U.S. Army set up its installations settlements grew around it. This would later become El Paso, Texas. From that time until around 1930, populations on both sides of the border moved freely across it.In 1853, a new border adjustment occurred when the territory of La Mesilla was sold to the United States, with which the new border line after the Rio Grande began precisely in Paso del Norte, reinforcing its status as a border town.\nDuring the French intervention in Mexico (1862\u20131867), Benito Ju\u00e1rez's republican forces stopped temporarily at El Paso del Norte before establishing his government-in-exile in Chihuahua. After 1882, the city grew, in large part, because of the arrival of the Mexican Central Railway. Commerce thrived in the city as more banks began operating, telegraph and telephone services became available, and trams appeared. These commercial activities were under the firm control of the city's oligarchy, which consisted of the Ochoa, Samaniego, Daguerre, Provencio, and Cuar\u00f3n families. In 1888, El Paso del Norte was renamed in honor of Benito Ju\u00e1rez.\nThe city expanded significantly thanks to D\u00edaz's free-trade policy, creating a new retail and service sector along the old Calle del Comercio (now Vicente Guerrero) and September 16 Avenue. A bullring opened in 1899. The Escobar brothers founded the city's first institution of higher education in 1906, the Escuela Particular de Agricultura. That same year, a series of public works are inaugurated, including the city's sewage and drainage system, as well as potable water. A public library, schools, new public market (the old Mercado Cuauht\u00e9moc) and parks dotted the city, making it one of many Porfirian showcases. Modern hotels and restaurants catered to the increased international railroad traffic from the 1880s on. However, national and foreign opposition to the \"disloyal\" commercial rivalry of the free zone was not long in coming and the Mexican government was forced to modify the status of the free zone in 1891. To this must be added the worldwide devaluation of silver and water scarcity, which generated a severe economic crisis in the city, causing a significant number of workers to flee to the United States. As a result of the collapse of commercial activities and population, Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez focused on tourism as an economic activity at the beginning of the 20th century, particularly promoting \"diversions\", thus beginning \"the moment of scandal\"\n\nIn 1909, D\u00edaz and William Howard Taft planned a summit in Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez and El Paso, a historic first meeting between a Mexican and a U.S. president, and also the first time a U.S. president would cross the border into Mexico. But tensions rose on both sides of the border over the disputed Chamizal strip connecting Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez to El Paso, even though it would have been considered neutral territory with no flags present during the summit. The Texas Rangers, 4,000 U.S. and Mexican troops, U.S. Secret Service agents, FBI agents and U.S. marshals were all called in to provide security. Frederick Russell Burnham, the celebrated scout, was put in charge of a 250 private security detail hired by John Hays Hammond. On October 16, the day of the summit, Burnham and Private C.R. Moore, a Texas Ranger, discovered a man holding a concealed palm pistol standing at the El Paso Chamber of Commerce building along the procession route. Burnham and Moore captured, disarmed, and arrested the assassin within only a few feet of D\u00edaz and Taft.The city was Mexico's largest border town by 1910\u2014and as such, it held strategic importance during the Mexican Revolution. In May 1911, about 3,000 revolutionary fighters under the leadership of Francisco Madero laid siege to Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, which was garrisoned by 500 regular Federal troops under the command of General Juan J Navarro. Navarro's force was supported by 300 civilian auxiliaries and local police. After two days of heavy fighting most of the city had fallen to the insurrectionists and the surviving federal soldiers had withdrawn to their barracks. Navarro then formally surrendered to Madero. The capture of a key border town at an early stage of the revolution not only enabled the revolutionary forces to bring in weapons and supplies from El Paso, but marked the beginning of the end for the demoralized Diaz regime.During the subsequent years of the conflict, Villa and other revolutionaries struggled for the control of the town (and income from the Federal Customs House), destroying much of the city during battles in 1911 and 1913. Much of the population abandoned the city between 1914 and 1917. Tourism, gambling, and light manufacturing drove the city's recovery from the 1920s until the 1940s. A series of mayors in the 1940s\u20131960s, like Carlos Villareal and Ren\u00e9 Mascare\u00f1as Miranda, ushered in a period of high growth and development predicated on the PRONAF border industrialization development program. A beautification program spruced up the city center, building a series of arched porticos around the main square, as well as neo-colonial fa\u00e7ades for main public buildings such as the city health clinic, the central fire station, and city hall. The cathedral, built in the 1950s, gave the city center the flavor of central Mexico, with its carved towers and elegant dome, but structural problems required its remodeling in the 1970s. The city's population reached some 400,000 by 1970. In 1984, the city had a radiation incident after a private medical company illegally purchased a radiation therapy unit. It was dismantled, sold to a junkyard and later smelted to produce six thousand tons of rebar (which is used to reinforce buildings), exposing thousands to radiation.\n\nJu\u00e1rez has grown substantially in recent decades due to a large influx of people moving into the city in search of jobs with the maquiladoras. As of 2014 more technological firms have moved to the city, such as the Delphi Corporation Technical Center, the largest in the Western Hemisphere, which employs over 2,000 engineers. Large slum housing communities called colonias have become extensive.\nJu\u00e1rez has a long, notorious history of drug trafficking and the intense related violence. Mexico's first homegrown cartel, run by Ignacia Jasso, was seated in the city, and for a time controlled much of the border drug trade. Today the Ju\u00e1rez Cartel controls the routes in Juarez. Related violence in the city is responsible for more than 1000 unsolved murders of young women from 1993 to 2003.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nDue to its location in the Chihuahuan Desert and high altitude, Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez has a cold desert climate (K\u00f6ppen: BWk). Seasons are distinct, with hot summers, mild springs and autumns, and cold winters. Summer average high is 35 \u00b0C (95 \u00b0F) with lows of 21 \u00b0C (70 \u00b0F). Winter highs average 14 \u00b0C (57 \u00b0F) with lows of 0 \u00b0C (32 \u00b0F). Rainfall is scarce and greater in summer. Snowfalls occur occasionally (about 4 times a year), between November and March. On December 26/27, 2015, parts of the city received 40 cm (16 in) of snow within a 24-hour period beating the previous record of 28 cm (11 in) set in 1951. The record high is 49 \u00b0C (120 \u00b0F) and the record low is \u221223 \u00b0C (\u22129 \u00b0F).\n\n\n=== Cityscape ===\n\nCiudad Ju\u00e1rez has many affluent neighborhoods, such as Campestre, Campos El\u00edseos, and Misi\u00f3n de Los Lagos. Other neighborhoods, including Anapra, Chave\u00f1a, and An\u00e1huac, would be considered more marginal, while the remaining neighborhoods in Ju\u00e1rez represent the middle- to working-class, for example, Infonavit, Las Misiones, Valle de Ju\u00e1rez, Lindavista, Altavista, Guadalajara, Galeana, Flores Mag\u00f3n, Mariano Escobedo, Los Nogales, and Independencia.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nBetween the 1960s and 1990s, Ju\u00e1rez saw a high level of population growth due in part to the newly established maquiladoras. The end of the Bracero Program also brought workers back from border cities in the U.S. through Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, contributing to the growing number of citizens.The average annual growth in population over a 10-year period [1990\u20132000] was 5.3%.  According to the 2010 population census, the city had 1,321,004 inhabitants, while the municipality had 1,332,131 inhabitants. During the last decades the city has received migrants from Mexico's interior, some figures state that 32% of the city's population originate outside the state of Chihuahua, mainly from the states of Durango (9.9%), Coahuila (6.3%), Veracruz (3.7%) and Zacatecas (3.5%), as well as from Mexico City (1.7%). Though most new residents are Mexican, some also immigrate from Central American countries, such as Guatemala, Haiti, El Salvador, Honduras and Nicaragua.However, a March 2009 article noted there has been a mass exodus of people who could afford to leave the city due to the ongoing violence from the Mexican Drug War. The article quoted a city planning department estimate of over 116,000 abandoned homes, which could roughly be the equivalent of 400,000 people who have left the city due to the violence. A September 2010 article in The Guardian  said of Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez: \"About 10,670 businesses \u2013 40% of the total \u2013 have shut down. A study by the city's university found that 116,000 houses have been abandoned and 230,000 people have left.\"\n\n\n== Government ==\nThe city is governed by a municipal president and an 18-seat council. The president is Armando Cabada Alvidrez, who won as an Independent candidate in 2016. Six national parties are represented on the council: the PRI, the National Action Party, Ecologist Green Party of Mexico, Party of the Democratic Revolution, Labor Party and the New Alliance Party.\n\n\n=== Crime and safety ===\n\nViolence towards women in the municipality increased dramatically between 1993 and the mid-2000s, with approximately 370 girls and women murdered and at least 400 women reported missing. Escalating turf wars between the rival Ju\u00e1rez and Sinaloa Cartels led to increasingly brutal violence in the city beginning in 2007.In 2012, the Ju\u00e1rez police department dismissed approximately 800 officers in an effort to clean up corruption within its ranks.  Recruitment goals set by the department called for the force to more than double. In 2009, a vigilante group calling itself Ju\u00e1rez Citizens Command threatened to put a stop to all the perpetrators of violence if the government continued to fail to curb the violence in the city. Government officials expressed concern that such vigilantism would contribute to further instability and violence.In 2008, General Moreno and the Third Infantry Company took over the fight against the cartels in town. They were removed in 2009, with the general and 29 of his associates now in custody and awaiting trial for charges of murder and civil rights violations.In response to increasing violence in the city, the presence of the Mexican Armed Forces and Federal Police has almost doubled. By August 2009 there were more than 7500 soldiers augmented by an expanded and highly restaffed municipal police force.\n\nAs of 2019, Ju\u00e1rez's murder rate placed #2 of the highest reported in the world, at 104 murders per 100,000 inhabitants. An August 2008 GQ article described a dispirited and disorderly atmosphere that permeated the city, caused by multiple factors including drug violence, government corruption and poverty.\n\n\n=== Crime reduction ===\nAfter the homicide rates escalated to the point of making Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez the most violent city in the world, violent crime began to decline in the early 2010s. In 2012, homicides were at their lowest rate since 2007 when drug violence flared between the Sinaloa and Ju\u00e1rez Cartel. That trend has continued in 2015 with 300 homicides reported, the lowest number since 2006. Explanations for the rapid decline in violence include the Sinaloa Cartel's success in defeating its rivals, as well as federal, state and local government efforts to combat crime and improve the city's quality of life.The cause of the reduction in crime is the subject of speculation. One theory attributes it to deals the rival gangs made to coexist once the federal police were withdrawn in 2011. Another holds that a more powerful trafficking network, such as Joaquin \"El Chapo\" Guzman's Sinaloa cartel, might have moved in and restored a kind of \"order among thieves.\" Others attribute it to the end of the cartel war between Ju\u00e1rez and Sinaloa, the arrest or dismissal of many policemen with cartel ties, resolutions reached by liaisons between government and a group of local leaders called \"La Mesa de Seguridad y Justicia\", and the creation of an anti-extortion squad to combat extortion inflicted upon local companies. Crime was significantly reduced from 2010 to 2014, with 3,500 homicides in 2010 and 430 in 2014. In 2015, there were only 311 homicides.The decrease in crime inspired more business in the city. Some citizens who left because of the violence have since returned with their families. Many of them had moved their businesses to El Paso. In addition, U.S companies are investing more in Ju\u00e1rez. Community centers work with victims of crime and teach women how to defend themselves. Citizens have also formed neighborhood watch groups and patrol neighborhoods. \"La Fundacion Comunitaria de la Frontera Norte\" is giving young people career opportunities and giving people hope. Technology HUB is a startup incubator working to diversify the city's economy and move the regions low-skill manufacturing industry into an innovation cluster. Its economic development projects are in line with the research of University of Berkeley Professor Enrico Moretti. Innovation economies are found to be more adaptive to shifting tech and trade conditions and more resilient to the kind of civil unrest that plagued Ciudad Juarez in the past. City officials have said that they have plans to increase tourism in the city. For example, in April 2015, the city created a new campaign to increase tourism called \"Juarez is waiting for you\". That same month, U.S. representative Beto O'Rourke visited Ju\u00e1rez to give a speech about how much Ju\u00e1rez has changed for the better. A children's museum was opened in honor of the children who lost their parents during the violent years. Businesses that were closed because of the violence and extortion have reopened in recent years. The city's violence was depicted in the 2015 film Sicario, drawing criticism and calls for a boycott from Juarez mayor Enrique Serrano Escobar, who said the film presented a false and negative image of the city. He said the violence the film depicted was accurate through about 2010, and that the city had made progress in restoring peace.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\n\n=== Notable natives and residents ===\n\n\n=== In popular culture ===\nPart of the action of the 2015 film Sicario is set in Ju\u00e1rez.\nThe Bob Dylan song \"Just Like Tom Thumb's Blues\" is set in a nightmarish depiction of Ju\u00e1rez.\nCiudad Ju\u00e1rez and the female homicides which took place there are the inspiration for the city of Santa Teresa in Roberto Bolano's 2004 novel 2666.\nThe Way She Spoke is a play by Isaac Gomez based on his interviews with people affected by the femicide in Ju\u00e1rez, Mexico. A First Look at Isaac Gomez's The Way She Spoke Off-Broadway, Playbill, July 19, 2019.\n\"Invalid Litter Department,\" a song by El Paso band At the Drive-In, centers on the murders of women in Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez.\nThe majority of the events depicted in the 2007 videogame Tom Clancy's GRAW 2 take place in and around the city. This drew the ire of then Mayor H\u00e9ctor Murgu\u00eda Lardiz\u00e1bal,who accused the game's publisher Ubisoft of \"painting a negative picture of his city\".\n\n\n== Economy and infrastructure ==\nThe El Paso Regional Economic Development Corporation indicated that Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez is the metropolis absorbing \"more new industrial real estate space than any other North American city.\"  The Financial Times Group through its publication The Foreign Direct Investment Magazine ranked Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez as the \"City of the Future\" for 2007\u20132008. The El Paso\u2013Ju\u00e1rez area is a major manufacturing center. CommScope, Electrolux, Bosch, Foxconn, Flextronics, Lexmark, Delphi, Visteon, Johnson Controls, Toro, Lear, Boeing, Cardinal Health, Yazaki, Sumitomo, and Siemens are some of the foreign companies that have chosen Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez for business operations.The Mexican state of Chihuahua is frequently among the top five states in Mexico with the most foreign investment. Many foreign retail, banking, and fast-food businesses have locations within Ju\u00e1rez.\nIn the 1990s, traditional brick kilns made up a big part of the economic informal sector. These were typically located in the poorer regions of Ju\u00e1rez. The kilns used open-air fires, where certain materials that were burned generated a lot of air pollution. Along with rapid industrialization, small brick kilns have been a big contributor to the high amount of air pollution in Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez. While the Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez economy has largely been dependent on Maquiladora program, business leaders have undertaken initiatives to upskill and secure the city are larger stake in the global manufacturing economy. Technology Hub is a business incubator that works with regionally based companies, on programs in skill development, and the transition into automation and industry 4.0.\n\n\n=== Media ===\nJu\u00e1rez has four local newspapers: El Diario, El Mexicano, El PM and Hoy.  El Norte was a fifth, but it ceased operations on April 2, 2017, following the murder of journalist Miroslava Breach because, the paper explained, the recent killings of several Mexican journalists made the job too dangerous.\n\n\n==== Digital NewsPapers ====\nJrznoticias\nEl Diario\n\n\n=== Transportation ===\n\n\n==== Public bus system ====\nThe main public transportation system in the city is the public bus system. The public buses run the main streets of Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez throughout the day, costing eight pesos (less than 40 cents) to ride one. Due to the aging current bus fleet being considered potentially outdated, the municipal government is working on replacing the buses with new ones, along with improving the bus stops, such as by equipping them with shade.The ViveBus bus rapid transit (BRT) system opened to the public in November 2013 with the first route of five planned. The project was made a reality with the collaboration of the local municipal government, the private enterprise of Integradora de Transporte de Ju\u00e1rez (INTRA) as well as other city government agencies.  Studies have shown that the current bus system averages 8 mph (13 km/h) while the new system is projected to average 16 mph (26 km/h).  The BRT system studies conducted by the Instituto Municipal de Investigacion Y Planeacion project a daily ridership of 40,000.\nThe first of the five routes opened to users in late 2013 and is officially named Presidencia-Tierra Nueva and has 34 stations distributed along the north to south corridor.  The route starts at Avenida Francisco Villa, follows north to Eje Vial Norte-Sur then veers left at Zaragoza Blvd. and ends at Avenida Independencia and the elevated Carretera Federal 2.\n\n\n==== Airport ====\nThe city is served by Abraham Gonz\u00e1lez International Airport, with flights to several Mexican cities. It accommodates national and international air traffic for the city. Nearby El Paso International Airport handles flights to cities within the United States.\n\n\n==== International border crossings ====\n\nThe first bridge to cross the Rio Grande at El Paso del Norte was built in the time of New Spain, over 250 years ago, from wood hauled in from Santa Fe.  Today, this bridge is honored by the modern Santa Fe Street Bridge, and Santa Fe Street in downtown El Paso.\nSeveral bridges serve the El Paso\u2013Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez area in addition to the Paso Del Norte Bridge also known as the Santa Fe Street Bridge, including the Bridge of the Americas, Stanton Street Bridge, and the Ysleta Bridge also known as the Zaragoza Bridge.\nThere is also a land crossing at nearby Santa Teresa, New Mexico, and another one, the Tornillo - Guadalupe International Bridge located 50 km southeast of Juarez City.\n\n\n==== Rail ====\n\n\n===== Light rail =====\nEl Paso City Lines operated a streetcar system in Ju\u00e1rez from 1881 until 1974.\n\n\n===== Heavy rail =====\nMexico North Western Railway's subsidiary operation, the El Paso and Southwestern Railroad, extended into the US at El Paso, Texas but no longer operates passenger rail.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\nAccording to the latest estimates, the literacy rate in the city is in line with the national average: 97.3% of people above 15 years old are able to read and write.Ju\u00e1rez has about 20 institutions of higher learning Universidades en Ju\u00e1rez, Chihuahua: 20 : Sistema de Informaci\u00f3n Cultural-Secretar\u00eda de Cultura. The largest ones are among the following:\n1. The Instituto Tecnol\u00f3gico de Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez (ITCJ), founded in 1964, became the first public institution of higher education in the city.\n2. The Autonomous University of Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez (Universidad Aut\u00f3noma de Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, UACJ), founded in 1968, is the largest university in the city. It has several locations inside of the city including the Institute of Biomedical Sciences (Instituto de Ciencias Biom\u00e9dicas, ICB), the Institute of Social and Administrative Sciences (Instituto de Ciencias Sociales y Administrativas, ICSA), the Institute of Architecture, Design and Art (Instituto de Arquitectura, Dise\u00f1o y Arte, IADA), the Institute of Engineering and Technology (Instituto de Ingenier\u00eda y Tecnolog\u00eda, IIT) and the University City (Ciudad Universitaria, CU) located in the southern part of Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez. The IADA and IIT share the same location appearing to be a single institute where the students from both institutes share facilities as buildings or classrooms with the exception of the laboratories of Engineering and the laboratories of Architecture, Design and Arts. The UACJ also has spaces for Fine Arts and Sports.These latter services are considered among the best because they recluse nearly 30,000 participants in sports such as swimming, racquetball, basketball and gymnastics, and arts such as Classical Ballet, Drama, Modern Dance, Hawaiian and Polynesian Dances, Folk dance, Music and Flamenco. \n3. The Faculty of Political and Social Sciences of the Autonomous University of Chihuahua (Universidad Aut\u00f3noma de Chihuahua, UACH) which has delivered 70% of the city's media and news crew, is located in the city. \n4. The local campuses of the Monterrey Institute of Technology and Higher Education (ITESM) The Monterrey Institute of Technology opened its campus in 1983. It is ranked as \"third best\" among other campuses of the institution, after the Garza Sada campus in Monterrey and the Santa Fe campus in Mexico City.. Technology Hub Juarez offers after school coding program, Kids 2 Code and is home to Fab Lab Juarez, a facility training people of all ages in the use of 3D printers, laser cutters, CNC routers and prototyping technology.5.

[\u02c8r\u0153st\u0259nb\u0153r\u03c7], Afrikaans and Dutch: City of Rest) is a city at the foot of the Magaliesberg mountain range. Rustenburg is the most populous city in North West province, South Africa (549,575 in 2011 and 626,522 in the 2016 census). In 2017, the city's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) reached ZAR 63.8 billion, accounting for 21.1% of the GDP of the North West Province, and 1.28% of the GDP of South Africa.  Rustenburg was one of the official host cities of the 2010 FIFA World Cup, being in close proximity to Phokeng, the capital of the Royal Bafokeng Nation, where the Royal Bafokeng Stadium is located. The England national football team also used this as their base camp for the tournament.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Mfecane ===\nBefore European settlers arrived, the area had been settled by agrarian Setswana-speaking tribes\nRustenburg's population is primarily Tswana people.  Partially belonging to the Royal Bafokeng Nation, extensive landowners earning royalties from mining operations. The Royal Bafokeng are descendants of Sotho settlers who displaced the local tribes from the region, which they came to call 'place of dew' (Phokeng). In the early 1800s, the Bafokeng and other Tswana communities were conquered in a series of devastating wars launched by an offshoot of the Zulu kingdom, called the Matebele.  The Boers had also fought the Zulu and Matebele, and so the Boers and Tswana found in the Matebele a common enemy.  The Tswana and Boers planned together and worked toward defeating the Matebele from a Sotho-Tswana kingdom to the south, and together, they defeated the Matebele.  As the Boers settled in the area, called their settlement Rustenburg because they had relatively friendly relations with their Bafokeng allies in the area, and after the many violent military conflicts with other African chiefdoms, such as the Matebele, they believed they could rest (\"rusten\" in Dutch) in this settlement, whose name literally means \"Resting Town.\"  Although had already long lived in the area when the Boers arrived, the Bafokeng bought land rights from the Boers, and they purchased their first tracts of land in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century from the colonial rulers, some in exchange for serving in the Boer Wars. Although these land purchases were technically illegal, Paul Kruger, who would become a president of the Transvaal Boer Republic, but was then a veld kornet, was friendly to the Bafokeng and helped arrange many of these purchases. A public hospital has been named after Paul Kruger.\n\n\n=== Establishment ===\nRustenburg was established in 1851 as an administrative centre for an Afrikaner farming area that produced citrus fruit, tobacco, peanuts, sunflower seeds, maize, wheat and cattle.  On 10 February 1859, the Reformed Churches in South Africa was founded under a Syringa tree, now commemorated with a memorial. Rustenburg was the home of Paul Kruger, president of the South African Republic, who bought a 5 square kilometer farm to the north-west of the town in 1863. The homestead on his farm, Boekenhoutfontein, is now the Paul Kruger Country Museum. When the Boer and the British came to blows in the Second Boer War (1899), the territory around Rustenburg became a battlefield. The two sides clashed at nearby Mafikeng, where the British garrison found itself under siege for months.\nAmong the early residents of Rustenburg were settlers of Indian origin. One of the first families of Indian origin was the Bhyat family, whose contribution to the city's history was marked by the renaming of a major street name to Fatima Bhayat Street in honour of Fatima Bhyat who arrived in Rustenburg with her husband in 1877.\nPlatinum mining in Rustenburg began in 1929, shortly after the discovery of the Platinum Reef by Hans Merensky, later named the Merensky Reef. The mine is located about 3 km from the town centre and owned and managed by the Anglo American plc. According to legend, the farmer that owned the land sold the mineral rights to Anglo American for R10 000.\n\n\n=== Post-Apartheid ===\nThe township of Boitekong on the northeast side of Rustenburg has one of the highest incidences of AIDS orphans in South Africa Rustenburg was the venue for World AIDS Day commemoration in December 2010. The township is in a geographical area which bears the brunt of the catchment area of the toxic effects of the mining industry coupled with a very poor quality of water supply from the local Bospoort Dam, the water from which was for decades considered too toxic for human consumption until water shortages in the nineties compelled the purification and supply to Boitekong. Life for the majority under the rule of the 'Royal Bafokeng' has parallels to the apartheid era.  In the Apartheid era, forced removals of old settlements were on the basis of racial divide whereas now it is done for installation of massive mining operations sometimes engulfing entire villages.The Royal Bafokeng company own the stadium selected as a World Cup 2010 venue, the only 'private' stadium that hosted games in the 2010 World cup. The Royal Bafokeng regard themselves as a 'separate nation' which is in contradiction to the Rainbow nation espoused by Desmond Tutu and Nelson Mandela. This 'nationhood' is regarded by many today as a divide and rule tactic orchestrated by the mining conglomerates which has subsequently led to the calls for nationalization of the mining industry by the ANC Youth League. The majority of people in the region 20 years after the fall of apartheid still live in abject poverty despite the massive profits yielded by the platinum royalties. This has led in recent years to claims of kleptocracy against the 'royal' family and land claim disputes.Agriculture in the region has been in constant decline since the decimation of the vast citrus estates of Rustenburg in the 1970s and 1980s due to pollution from increased smelting and beneficiating processes by mines. There are only a fraction of the original citrus farms remaining.In 1990, the first post-Apartheid conference between the Nederduits Gereformeerde Kerk (the Dutch Reformed Church in Africa) and the South African churches was held in Rustenburg. During this conference, professor Willie Jonker of the University of Stellenbosch made this confession on behalf of the entire DRC:\n\n\"[I] confess before you and before the Lord, not only my own sin and guilt,\nand my personal responsibility for the political, social, economic and structural wrongs that have been done to many of you and the results [from] which you and our whole country are still suffering, but vicariously I dare also to do that in the name of the NGK [the white DRC], of which I am a member, and for the Afrikaans people as a whole.\"\nThe conference finally resulted in the signing of the Rustenburg Declaration, which moved strongly toward complete confession, forgiveness, and restitution.\n\n\n== Climate ==\nRustenburg has a humid subtropical climate (K\u00f6ppen Cwa), with a relatively high degree of diurnal temperature variation due to the high elevation. It has very warm summers (from December to February) and mild winters (from June to August). Due to the altitude, summers are not quite as hot as one might expect.

Rustenburg is one of only 5 South African cities to have a community foundation, called the Greater Rustenburg Community Foundation (GRCF), that seeks to ensure the regional development reaches all levels of society.\n\n\n=== Transformation of Rustenburg into a Smart City ===\nRustenburg has been highly dependent on mining which is responsible for more than 65% of local GDP and 50% of all direct jobs. The secondary GDP contributors are, by a considerable margin, finance (9%) and retail (8%).

The Ancient Kano City Walls were described as \"the most impressive monument in West Africa\".\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Ancient Kano City Walls were built as a defensive wall with the construction of the foundation laid by Sarki Gijimasu (r. 1095\u20131134), the third king of the Kingdom of Kano in the Kano Chronicle. In the mid 14th century during the reign of Zamnagawa, the wall was completed before it was further expanded during the 16th century.

The city was located near the Breton border, near Maine, Anjou and Normandy. They cover an area of 8 hectares with a length of 500 m long and 200 m width. The fortifications of the thirteenth century are the best preserved in Brittany.\n\n\n== Situation ==\nThe ramparts follow the contours of the rocky plateau where the Ch\u00e2teau de Vitr\u00e9 and the urban nucleus developing around the Church of Notre-Dame \u00c9glise_Notre-Dame_de_Vitr\u00e9 are built. The construction of the ramparts was made according to the defensive strengths and constraints of the relief.\nThe town is located on a plateau with very deep valleys. To the north flows the river Vilaine where there was a pond, swamps and a very high talus of 30 meters. The views over the landscape were excellent. In the south, the depression created by Vernouzet Vernouzet stream was an additional protection. The defensive fragility was to the east, direction from Laval and the French Kingdom, because access was so easy.\nVitr\u00e9 is located in the Armorican Massif, at the interface of zones of beige sandstone, and schists (argillites, black micaceous siltites, locally with ferruginous oolites). The ramparts are built with these materials available on the place. As a consequence, the exploitation of the stone has allowed the creation of large ditches to the south and east of the intramuros city of the order of 12 m (39 ft.) depth and a width of 20 m (66 ft.). A small supermarket in the rue de la Borderie has two levels of basement up to the level of the old ditches and illustrates these dimensions.\nThe inventory of the Baronnie de Vitr\u00e9 in 1681 testifies to the presence of springs and fountains in the moat, exploited by the inhabitants of the faubourgs for laundry, orchards and gardens.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe ramparts were built in 1240 by Baron Andrew III and reinforced with the development of artillery in the 15th century.\nVitr\u00e9 was a Protestant city, rich and prosperous. But during the religious wars, attacks by the Catholic leagues destroyed a part of the towers and ramparts east of the ancient city. At the end of the 16th century, a bastion was built in 1591.\nThe fortifications were destroyed in the south in the 19th century to connect the old town with the modern neighborhood. The Gare de Vitr\u00e9 arrived in 1857.\nIn 1987, the Tour des Claviers was discovered during the construction of a residential building. The old town is classified as a \"remarkable heritage site\" and the town borough engages in the renovation of this ramparts (Tour de la Bridole). All fortifications have been classified \"historical monuments\" on January 15, 2014.The remains of walls and towers are the most outstanding to the north and east of the intramuros of Vitr\u00e9, along the Promenade du Val with exceptional point of view.\n\n\n== Plan of fortifications ==\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==\n\nDaniel Pichot, Val\u00e9rie Lagier et Gwenol\u00e9 Allain, Vitr\u00e9 : Histoire et Patrimoine d'une Ville, Vitr\u00e9, Somogy, \u00c9ditions d'Art, avril 2009, 295 p.

The corporate head office is located in Boca Raton, Florida. In February 2016, the company was acquired by Apollo Global Management for $6.9 billion in a leveraged buyout.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn 1863, Edward A. Calahan invented a stock ticker and formed the Gold and Stock Telegraph Company in 1867 to exploit the technology.  Gold and Stock also developed a messenger system that sent instructions to and from the stock exchange floor.   Three years later, the president of Gold and Stock Telegraph Company woke up to a burglar in his home, which inspired him to create a telegraph-based alert system.  This system eventually connected 50 of his neighbors to a central station where all the alert boxes were monitored. There were many small telegraph delivery companies in the United States in the 19th century.\nIn 1874, 57 district telegraph delivery companies affiliated and became American District Telegraph (ADT).  With the increase in telephone usage in the late 19th century, ADT's messenger business slowly declined in popularity.  ADT tried branching out and developing their signaling business, while still maintaining their telegraph business as primary income source.\nADT incorporated into Western Union in 1901 and separated its messenger business from its main signaling business at that time.  In 1909, Western Union and ADT came under the control of American Telephone & Telegraph Company (AT&T). ADT began to expand into new areas, such as fire alarms and security alarms between 1910 and 1930, but was kept separate from AT&T's Holmes alarm business. ADT became a publicly traded company in the 1960s.In 1964, ADT was found to be a monopoly in restraint of trade.  It was shown to provide almost 80% of the central station alarm service in the United States.  In some cities, such as New York City and Memphis, Tennessee, they were the sole provider. They were also found to have forced competitors out of business by lowering prices below cost. They would charge national accounts very low prices in cities with competitors and much higher prices where no competition was available.  ADT was forced to adopt a national price list, which could not be varied, to help establish central station competitors in cities without competition, and to pay fines and triple damages to the federal government, customers, and local competitors.In early 1987, the firm Hawley Goodall, owned by Lord Ashcroft, bought the Indianapolis-based Crime Control Inc., the fourth-largest company in the U.S. security market, for $50 million.  Later in the year, it bought ADT and moved to Bermuda. This purchase transformed Hawley into the leading security services business in the United States, and resulted in the majority of its revenues coming from the North American market. As a result of the acquisition, Hawley changed its name to ADT Limited and decided to refocus its business around security services. At the end of 1987, the company sold its North American\u2013based facility services business to Denmark's ISS A/S.\nIn 1997, ADT was purchased by Tyco International in a reverse takeover.\n\n\n=== Broadview Security acquisition ===\n\nIn January 2010, Tyco announced that it was acquiring Broadview Security (formerly Brinks Home Security) and was merging the company with its ADT division in a transaction valued at $2.0 billion.  In 2008, Brink's had spun out its home security business, which accounted for 15% of Brink's revenue that year, into a separate publicly traded company. Brinks Home Security had rebranded as Broadview Security in 2009 with a massive advertising campaign.  The ads were widely criticized as unscrupulous, fear-mongering, and  exaggerating what home security systems were capable of doing. Unflattering parodies of Broadview's TV commercials, mocking the company's attempts to manipulate consumers, were posted online, along with a filmed Saturday Night Live sketch featuring Andy Samberg and Bill Hader. The acquisition of Broadview closed in mid-2010, and combined the #1 and #2 security companies in North America, adding Broadview's 1.3 million customer accounts and $565 million in annual recurring revenue to ADT's existing customer base of 7.4 million accounts and $3 billion in annual revenue.\n\n\n=== Other acquisitions ===\n\nIn September 2011, Tyco announced that it would split into three companies, ADT being one of the three. On October 1, 2012, ADT debuted as an independent public company and began trading on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE: ADT). In 2014, it acquired the Canadian company Reliance Protectron Security Services from Reliance Home Comfort.In February 2016, Apollo Global Management acquired ADT for nearly $7 billion and merged it with another home security firm, Protection 1. The purchase price represented a premium of approximately 56 percent over ADT's closing share price on February 12, 2016, and when combined with Protection 1 represented an aggregate transaction value of approximately $15 billion.In October 2019, Telus Corporation purchased all of ADT's Canadian assets for $700 million. By September 2020, Telus had renamed ADT's Canadian assets to Telus SmartHome Security.\n\n\n== Operations ==\nAs of March 2019, ADT had nine monitoring centers and a network of more than 17,000 professionals, serving 6 million customers in over 200 locations throughout the United States.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nBusiness data for ADT Inc.: \nOfficial website", "infobox": {"name": "ADT Inc.", "former_name": "The ADT Corporation", "logo": "ADT Security Services Logo.svg", "type": "[[Public company|Public]]", "traded_as": "{{ubl|NYSE|ADT|s|[[Russell 1000]] component}} {{NYSE|ADT}} s", "industry": "Burglary, Fire and Carbon Monoxide detection, Health safety, Cybersecurity, [[Fire suppression]], [[Security systems]], [[Communication systems]], [[Video surveillance]], [[Access control]], [[Radio frequency identification]], [[Electronic article surveillance]]", "founded": "{{start date and age|1874}} (as American District Telegraph)", "location": "[[Boca Raton, Florida]], U.S.", "key_people": "'''Jim DeVries''' <br />(Chief Executive Officer)<br />\n'''Jeff Likosar''' <br />(Chief Financial Officer)<br />\n'''Dan Bresingham''' <br />(Chief Administrative Officer)<br />\n'''P.

Through joint ventures with BBC Studios, the company manages BBC America and BBC World News cable channels in the US. Due to this relationship, AMC Networks additionally maintains a minority share in the US operations of the British-TV streaming service BritBox, a joint venture between the BBC and ITV plc.\nThe company was originally launched in 1980 and formerly known as Rainbow Media Holdings, LLC (or alternately Rainbow Programming Holdings), a subsidiary of Cablevision, but was spun off as a publicly traded company in July 2011. The company is majority-owned and controlled by the Dolan family.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== As \"Rainbow Media\" ===\nWhen Rainbow Programing Services was formed in mid-1980, it originally was a joint-venture of four cable television companies: Cablevision, Comcast, Cox Communications, and Daniels & Associates. The first service to come out of the partnership was launched on December 8, 1980. The hybrid service, which broadcast nightly on satellite time subleased from the National Christian Network featured culture events network Bravo on Sunday and Monday nights and adult-oriented B movie network Escapade the rest of the week. Due to the involvement of the four cable companies, the new service quickly gained subscribers. By July 1981, both channels expanded their offerings to seven nights a week. In August 1981, Playboy Enterprises became half-owner of Escapade which introduced a new programming block to the channel in early 1982. By the end of that year the network would relaunch as The Playboy Channel.In the years that followed, the three other cable companies would exit the partnership, leaving Cablevision as the sole owner of Rainbow by 1983. Cablevision transferred control of its previously launched regional sports network SportsChannel New York to Rainbow. In 1983, three other regional sports networks were acquired: PRISM New England (soon to be relaunched as SportsChannel New England), Philadelphia-based PRISM, and Chicago-based SportsVision. Playboy also bought out Rainbow's share in The Playboy Channel, although it would continue to market the channel for the next few years.\nIn 1984, Rainbow added another new network to its portfolio, American Movie Classics (AMC) which initially featured \"classic\" pre-1970 movies. Cablevision began packaging AMC and Bravo together as the Rainbow Service. Near the end of 1984, CBS and Cablevision announced a deal to have CBS take 50% ownership in the Rainbow Service and Rainbow's marketing. The agreement also gave CBS partial ownership in the regional sports properties which had already become a joint venture with The Washington Post (the Post did not have ownership in Bravo or AMC). In 1986, Tele-Communications Inc. purchased a stake in AMC. Through this deal, the network which had 300,000 subscribers was able to greatly expand carriage to most of TCI's 3.9 million subscribers. Long Island cable news service News 12 was also launched in 1986.\nCBS and Cablevision parted ways in 1987. In 1988, Rainbow's SportsChannel would make its largest programing deal, gaining national television rights for the National Hockey League. Cablevision gained a new partner that year, NBC, which obtained 50% ownership in Rainbow.  Through this partnership, five additional regional sports networks were created in the Bay Area, Cincinnati, Cleveland, Philadelphia, and Los Angeles. The partnership also produced the Olympics Triplecast, a pay-per-view service providing additional coverage of the 1992 Summer Olympics.\n1994 saw the launch of an American feed of the Canadian music channel MuchMusic USA, in partnership with CHUM Limited (who would launch a Canadian version of Bravo the year after), and the Independent Film Channel.\n. Years later would CHUM sell their stake to Rainbow in 2000 and revoked their license for the MuchMusic name, which culminated into a rebrand as Fuse in 2003. Fuse became a part of MSG Media in 2010, and has since been spun off as Fuse Media.\nIn 1997, Romance Classics (later WE), a channel that had been in planning for over five year and had its launch date pushed back multiple times was finally launched. But Rainbow's largest venture that year was the merger of SportsChannel into Fox Sports Net. Rainbow retained varying ownership interests in all of the former SportsChannel networks except PRISM and SportsChannel Philadelphia, which were both shut down to make way for the first Comcast SportsNet. Over the next decade, all of these networks except SportsChannel NY (then Fox Sports New York) were gradually sold off. Fox Sports New York was then transferred to the MSG Media division and rebranded MSG+.Rainbow ran the local-minded MSG Metro Channels which launched in 1998, before folding them in late 2005.Through a series of transactions, beginning in 1997, NBC's stake was eventually reduced. In 2002, Cablevision sold its share of Bravo to NBC and as part of the deal, NBC gave up its then 20% share in Rainbow.\n2003 saw Rainbow DBS Company launch a DBS satellite service, the HDTV-oriented Voom. The service ceased operations on April 30, 2005, and instead several of Voom's HD channels were launched on Dish Network and Cablevision, now bannered as Voom HD Networks. The networks were discontinued in 2009.\nIn 2005, Cablevision considered spinning off its content subsidiary Rainbow Media as a publicly traded company, and making their core cable business private, but withdrew the plan. In 2006, a new plan emerged to privatize all of Cablevision, including Rainbow Media. In January 2007, with no word on if the privatization would go through, Liberty Media expressed interest in acquiring Rainbow Media from Cablevision.\nIn June 2008, Rainbow acquired the Sundance Channel from NBCUniversal, CBS, and Robert Redford. Rainbow Media also owned Wedding Central which was shut down the same day AMC Networks went public.\n\n\n=== As \"AMC Networks\" ===\n\n\n==== 2011\u20132020 ====\nOn March 10, 2011, Cablevision, as approved by its board on December 16, 2010, announced that Rainbow Media would be spun off as a publicly traded company, AMC Networks, later in 2011, and, as said in 2005, making their core cable business private. Rainbow Media's former President Josh Sapan serves as the president and chief executive of AMC Networks which went public on July 1, 2011.On May 4, 2012, Dish Network announced that it would no longer carry the AMC Networks family of cable channels upon the expiration of the satellite provider's distribution agreement with the company at the end of June 2012, citing that AMC Networks charged an excessive amount in retransmission consent payments from the service for their carriage and low audience viewership for the channels.AMC Networks responded to Dish Network's announcement of its pending removal of the channels as being related to a 2008 breach of contract lawsuit against Dish Network by the company's former Voom HD Networks subsidiary (under the company's previous Rainbow Media Holdings brand) (which is pending trial in the New York State Supreme Court), in which it is seeking more than $2.5 billion in damages against Dish Network for improperly terminating its carriage contract; Voom's high-definition channels were carried on the provider from May 1, 2005 until May 12, 2008 when Dish removed ten of Voom's fifteen channels from its lineup and the five remaining channels the following day. Dish Network stated that the lawsuit is unrelated to the decision to remove the AMC Networks channels and that it ended the carriage agreement on its own terms.On May 20, 2012, Dish Network removed Sundance Channel from its channel lineup. Two weeks later on June 4, 2012, Dish relocated AMC, WEtv, and IFC to higher channel positions with AMC being split into two separate standard definition and high definition channel feeds (AMC moved from channel 130 to channel 9609 for the SD feed and 9610 for the HD feed, WEtv moved from channel 128 to channel 9608 and IFC was moved from channel 393 to channel 9607); the former channel lineup spaces occupied by the three channels were respectively replaced with HDNet, Style and MoviePlex multiplex channel Indieplex. The move is believed to be in response to an ad run during a June 3 airing of an episode of Mad Men urging Dish Network customers to inform the company to keep the three AMC Networks channels on the satellite provider, with Dish Network stating that the relocated channel positions better reflect the channels' ratings.On July 1, 2012, Dish Network dropped AMC, WEtv, and IFC from the channel line-up altogether.\nOn July 12, 2012, AMC said in an e-mailed statement that it would stream over the Internet the season premiere of Breaking Bad to Dish customers. \"Dish subscribers can register online starting July 13 for the show, which airs on July 15. We want to give Dish customers an extra week to switch providers so they can enjoy the rest of the season.\"On October 21, 2012, AMC Networks announced a settlement was reached between them, Cablevision and Dish in which Dish was forced to pay up to $700 million in damages to Cablevision for damages from removing Voom owned channels off the Dish lineup back in 2008, and in return Dish signed a new agreement to bring the AMC Networks owned channels back on the Dish lineup with AMC returning October 21 and the rest on November 1.From 2013 to 2015, the company acquired or joined a joint venture each year. On October 28, 2013, AMC Networks announced it would acquire most of Chellomedia, sans Chello Benelux, an international operator of cable networks, from Liberty Global for around $1.04 billion. On October 23, 2014, AMC confirmed it had purchased a 49.9% stake in BBC America, with BBC Studios retaining the remaining share of the network. In 2015, AMC Networks, along with Upfront Ventures, Daher Capital, Northgate Ventures, invested a round of funding in the Latin YouTube network MiT\u00fa.In 2016, AMC Networks finalized a partnership agreement with former BET founder Robert L. Johnson's RLJ Company. According to the agreement, AMC will use its programming and distribution clout to benefit Acorn and UMC. Additionally, the RLJ-AMC partnership will allow for greater investment in content from African-American creatives, Johnson emphasized. The agreement called for AMC to provide RLJ with a $60 million loan on a seven-year term and $5 million on a one-year term. AMC has received warrants to purchase at least 20 million shares or the equivalent of 50.1% of the company. The time frame for exercising those warrants is open-ended, AMC said.On November 15, 2016, AMC acquired a minority stake in comedy video website and film and television production company Funny or Die, with plans to integrate it with IFC.On April 27, 2018, the company, as the owner of IFC, acquired a majority stake in comedy venue operator Levity Live.On July 30, 2018, AMC Networks reached a definitive agreement to acquire RLJ Entertainment where AMC would pay $59 million for the remaining RLJE shares not owned by AMC or Robert L. Johnson. The transaction was approved by RLJ Entertainment's stockholders on October 31, and AMC Networks completed the acquisition on November 1. RLJ Entertainment became a privately owned subsidiary of AMC Networks, with Johnson and his affiliates owning a 17% stake.\nIn 2019, AMC Networks and the New Zealand public broadcaster TVNZ entered into an agreement to jointly produce The Dead Lands, a M\u0101ori\u2013theme supernatural series set in pre-contact New Zealand. The series was distributed by AMC's streaming service Shudder in the US, Canada, UK, and Ireland and by TVNZ On Demand in New Zealand.\n\n\n==== 2020\u2013present ====\nIn early 2020, the AMC Networks involved Switzer Group to lead the redesign of its ten floor headquarters at 11 Penn Plaza, New York.In September 2020, executive chairman Charles Dolan retired from his position, moving to a chairman emeritus role. His son, James L. Dolan, was then named chairman of AMC Networks.On February 2, 2021, AMC Networks entered into a strategic partnership with Canadian production company Shaftesbury Films. AMC made an investment in the company, thus giving them access to the latter's slate and expanding their content and development capabilities in Canada.On January 5, 2022, AMC Networks acquired Japanese anime company Sentai Holdings, including distributor Sentai Filmworks, and streaming service HIDIVE.\n\n\n== Units ==\n\n\n=== Television channels ===\nAMC\nIFC\nSundanceTV\nWeTV\nBBC America\n\n\n=== Streaming services ===\nAcorn TV\nAllblk\nAMC+\nBritBox (minority stake)\nHIDIVE\nIFC Films Unlimited\nShudder\nSundance Now\nWE tv+\n\n\n=== Other assets ===\nMiT\u00fa (investment)\nLevity Live (majority stake)\nSentai Filmworks\nAnime Network\n\n\n==== AMC Networks International ====\n\nOn October 28, 2013, AMC Networks announced it would acquire most of Chellomedia, an international operator of cable networks, from Liberty Global for around $1.04 billion.

( MOHN-d\u0259-LEEZ), often stylized as Mondel\u0113z, is an American multinational confectionery, food, holding and beverage and snack food company based in Chicago, Illinois. Mondelez has an annual revenue of about $26 billion and operates in approximately 160 countries. It ranked No. 108 in the 2021 Fortune 500 list of the largest United States corporations by total revenue.The company has its origins as Kraft Foods Inc., which was founded in 1923 in Chicago. The present enterprise was established in 2012 when Kraft Foods was renamed Mondelez and retained its snack food business, while its grocery business was spun off to a new company called Kraft Foods Group. The name is derived from the Latin word mundus (\"world\") and delez, a fanciful modification of the word \"delicious.\"The Mondelez International company manufactures chocolate, cookies, biscuits, gum, confectionery, and powdered beverages. Mondelez International's portfolio includes several billion-dollar components. These components includes cookie and cracker brands Belvita, Chips Ahoy!, Oreo, Ritz, TUC, Triscuit, LU, Club Social, Sour Patch Kids, Barny, and Peek Freans; chocolate brands Milka, C\u00f4te d'Or, Toblerone, Cadbury, Green & Black's, Freia, Marabou, Fry's, and Lacta; gum and cough drop brands Trident, Dentyne, Chiclets, Halls, and Stride; as well as Tate's Bake Shop cookies and powdered beverage brand Tang.Mondelez Canada holds the rights to Christie Brown and Company, which consists of brands such as Mr. Christie, Triscuits and Dad's Cookies. Its head office is in Mississauga, Ontario, with operations in Toronto, Hamilton, Ontario and Montreal, Quebec.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Before Mondelez International ===\n\nMondelez International is rooted in the National Dairy Products Corporation (National Dairy), which was founded on December 10, 1923, by Thomas H. McInnerney and Edward E. Rieck. The firm was initially set up to execute on a rollup strategy in the fragmented United States ice cream industry.In 1924, Kraft Cheese Company was founded and was listed on the Chicago Stock Exchange. Two years later, it was listed on the New York Stock Exchange. In 1928, it acquired Phenix Cheese Company, the maker of a cream cheese branded as Philadelphia Cream Cheese, founded by Jason F. Whitney Sr. and the company changed its name to Kraft-Phenix Cheese Company.In 1930, National Dairy acquired Kraft Phenix. After the acquisition, the combined company retained the National Dairy name and management, though the Kraft Phenix side of the company continued to operate largely independently.On September 7, 2009, Kraft made a hostile \u00a310.2 billion takeover bid for the British confectionery group Cadbury, makers of Dairy Milk and Bournville chocolate. On November 9 the company's bid (then \u00a39.8 billion) was rejected by Cadbury, which called it a \"derisory\" offer. Kraft renewed the offer on December 4. It had significant political and public opposition in the United Kingdom and abroad, leading to a call for the government to implement economic protectionism in large-company takeovers. On January 19, 2010, Cadbury approved a revised offer from Kraft which valued the company at \u00a311.5 billion ($19.5 billion). Some funds for the takeover were provided by the Royal Bank of Scotland, the partially state-owned British bank.Cadbury sales were flat after Kraft's acquisition. Despite the Cadbury takeover helping to boost overall sales by 30 percent, Kraft's net profit for the fourth quarter fell 24 percent (to $540 million) due to costs associated with integrating the UK business after the acquisition. Kraft spent $1.3 billion on integration to achieve an estimated $675 million in annual savings by the end of 2012. Kraft increased prices to offset rising commodity costs for corn, sugar, and cocoa in North America and Europe. According to Rosenfeld, \"We expect it will remain weak for the foreseeable future.\" Taking into account integration costs, the acquisition reduced Kraft's earnings per share by about 33% immediately after the Cadbury purchase.In August 2011, Kraft Foods announced plans to split into two publicly traded companies, an international snack-food company and a North American grocery company.The snack-food company, called Mondelez International, would be the legal successor of the old Kraft Foods, while the grocery company would be a new company, Kraft Foods Group. The split was completed in October 2012. It was structured so that Kraft Foods changed its name to Mondelez International and spun off Kraft Foods Group as a new publicly traded company. Kraft Foods Group later merged with Heinz to become Kraft Heinz.\n\n\n=== Mondel\u0113z International ===\nIn 2014, the company announced a merger of its coffee business with the Dutch firm Douwe Egberts. The name of the newly merged company would be Jacobs Douwe Egberts. The merger was confirmed on May 6, 2014, and completed on July 2, 2015.On June 30, 2016, Mondelez made a $23 billion offer to buy its smaller rival, Hershey. The half-cash, half-stock deal valued Hershey stock at $107 a share. Hershey's board, however, unanimously rejected the offer.In August 2017, it was announced that Dirk Van de Put, Belgian CEO of McCain Foods, would succeed Irene Rosenfeld as CEO in November 2017.On May 6, 2018, Mondelez agreed to buy cookie maker Tate's Bake Shop for approximately $500 million. The acquisition was completed on June 7, 2018.On June 19, 2019, Mondelez agreed to acquire a majority interest in Perfect Snacks, owner of refrigerated protein bar Perfect Bar. The acquisition was completed on July 16.On February 25, 2020, Mondelez announced that it was acquiring a majority stake in Toronto-based Give & Go, a maker of two-bite brownies. The acquisition was completed on April 3, 2020.In January 2021, Mondelez announced that it had bought Hu Master Holdings for more than $250 million.On May 26, 2021, Mondelez announced an agreement to acquire Greek snack company Chipita S.A., a high-growth key player in the Central and Eastern European croissants and baked snacks category.  On January 3, 2022, Mondelez announced that the acquisition is complete. \n\n\n== Finances ==\nFor the fiscal year 2017, Mondel\u0113z International reported earnings of US$2.922 billion, with an annual revenue of US$25.896 billion, a decline of 0.1% over the previous fiscal cycle. Mondel\u0113z International's shares traded at over $42 per share, and its market capitalization was valued at over US$58.8 billion in October 2018. In the first quarter of 2020, due to COVID-19 lockdowns and people stocking up with sweets, the company's sales grew by 15% in North America, increasing its overall revenue by almost 3%.\n\n\n== Controversies ==\n\n\n=== Deforestation ===\nIn September 2017, an investigation conducted by NGO Mighty Earth found that a large amount of the cocoa used in chocolate produced by Mondelez and other major chocolate companies was grown illegally in national parks and other protected areas in Ivory Coast and Ghana. The countries are the world's two largest cocoa producers.The report documents how in several national parks and other protected areas, 90% or more of the land mass has been converted to cocoa. Less than four percent of Ivory Coast remains densely forested, and the chocolate companies' laissez-faire approach to sourcing has driven extensive deforestation in Ghana as well. In Ivory Coast, deforestation has pushed chimpanzees into just a few small pockets, and reduced the country's elephant population from several hundred thousand to about 200\u2013400.In November 2018, an investigation by Greenpeace International found that 22 palm oil suppliers to Mondelez International cleared over 70,000 hectares (170,000 acres; 270 sq mi) of rainforest from 2015 to 2017.\n\n\n=== Wheat futures price-fixing allegation ===\nIn April 2015, the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) alleged that Mondelez International and its former subsidiary, Mondelez Global, bought $90 million (\u00a361 million) of wheat futures with no intention of taking delivery. According to the CTFC, the purchase raised the price of the commodity and earned the company $5.4 million.\n\n\n=== Child slavery ===\nIn 2021, Mondelez International was named in a class action lawsuit filed by eight former child slaves from Mali who allege that the company aided and abetted their enslavement on cocoa plantations in Ivory Coast. The suit accused Mondelez (along with Nestl\u00e9, Cargill, Mars, Olam International, The Hershey Company, and Barry Callebaut) of knowingly engaging in forced labor, and the plaintiffs sought damages for unjust enrichment, negligent supervision, and intentional infliction of emotional distress.\n\n\n=== Business in Russia ===\nAfter the Russian invasion of Ukraine on February 24, 2022, many international companies felt compelled to reduce or end business in the Russian Federation. As of March 12, 2022, Mondelez International was listed in an online spreadsheet by Yale professor Jeffrey Sonnenfeld as being among a minority of companies continuing to do business in Russia, where it generates 3.5% of annual revenue (approximately $1 billion).\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Mondel\u0113z International at Wikimedia Commons\nOfficial website \nBusiness data for Mondelez International: \nNew York Times article about Mondelez name and rebranding", "infobox": {"name": "Mondel\u0113z International, Inc.", "logo": "Mondelez international 2012 logo.svg", "image": "ThreeParkwayNorth3.jpeg", "image_size": "250px", "image_caption": "Mondelez headquarters in Chicago, Illinois", "type": "[[Public company|Public]]", "traded_as": "{{ubl|Nasdaq|MDLZ| (Class A)|[[Nasdaq-100]] component|[[S&P 100]] component|[[S&P 500]] component}} {{Nasdaq|MDLZ}} (Class A)", "predecessor": "[[Kraft Foods Inc.]]", "founder": "Thomas H.

Monsanto's best known product is Roundup, a glyphosate-based herbicide, developed in the 1970s. Later the company became a major producer of genetically engineered crops. In 2018, the company ranked 199th on the Fortune 500 of the largest United States corporations by revenue.Monsanto was one of four groups to introduce genes into plants in 1983, and was among the first to conduct field trials of genetically modified crops in 1987. It was one of the top 10 US chemical companies until it divested most of its chemical businesses between 1997 and 2002, through a process of mergers and spin-offs that focused the company on biotechnology. Monsanto was one of the first companies to apply the biotechnology industry business model to agriculture, using techniques developed by biotech drug companies.:\u200a2\u20136\u200a In this business model, companies recoup R&D expenses by exploiting biological patents.Monsanto's roles in agricultural changes, biotechnology products, lobbying of government agencies, and roots as a chemical company have resulted in controversies. The company once manufactured controversial products such as the insecticide DDT, PCBs, Agent Orange, and recombinant bovine growth hormone. Its seed patenting model was criticized as biopiracy and a threat to biodiversity as invasive species.In September 2016, German chemical company Bayer announced its intent to acquire Monsanto for US$66 billion in an all-cash deal. After gaining US and EU regulatory approval, the sale was completed on June 7, 2018. The name Monsanto was no longer used, but Monsanto's previous product brand names were maintained. In June 2020, Bayer agreed to pay numerous settlements in lawsuits involving Monsanto products Roundup, PCBs and Dicamba.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== \"Pre-Pharmacia\" Monsanto ===\n\n\n==== 1901 to WWII ====\nIn 1901 Monsanto was founded in St. Louis, Missouri, as a chemical company. The founder was John Francis Queeny, who at age 42 was a 30\u2011year veteran of the nascent pharmaceutical industry. He funded the firm with his own money and capital from a soft drink distributor. He used for the company name, the maiden name of his wife, Olga M\u00e9ndez Monsanto, who was a scioness of the Sephardic Jewish Monsanto family. The company's first products were commodity food additives, such as the artificial sweetener saccharin, caffeine and vanillin.:\u200a6\u200aMonsanto expanded to Europe in 1919 in a partnership with Graesser's Chemical Works at Cefn Mawr, Wales. The venture produced vanillin, aspirin and its raw ingredient salicylic acid, and later rubber processing chemicals. In the 1920s, Monsanto expanded into basic industrial chemicals such as sulfuric acid and PCBs. Queeny's son Edgar Monsanto Queeny took over the company in 1928. In 1926 the company founded and incorporated a town called Monsanto in Illinois (now known as Sauget). It was formed to provide minimal regulation and low taxes for Monsanto plants at a time when local jurisdictions had most of the responsibility for environmental rules. It was renamed in honor of Leo Sauget, its first village president.In 1935, Monsanto bought the Swann Chemical Company in Anniston, Alabama, and thereby entered the business of producing PCBs.In 1936, Monsanto acquired Thomas & Hochwalt Laboratories in Dayton, Ohio, to acquire the expertise of Charles Allen Thomas and Carroll A. Hochwalt. The acquisition became Monsanto's Central Research Department.:\u200a340\u2013341\u200a Thomas spent the rest of his career at Monsanto, serving as President (1951\u20131960) and Board Chair (1960\u20131965). He retired in 1970. In 1943, Thomas was called to a meeting in Washington, D.C., with Leslie Groves, commander of the Manhattan Project, and James Conant, president of Harvard University and chairman of the National Defense Research Committee (NDRC). They urged Thomas to become co-director of the Manhattan Project at Los Alamos with Robert Oppenheimer, but Thomas was reluctant to leave Dayton and Monsanto. He joined the NDRC, and Monsanto's Central Research Department began to conduct related research.:\u200avii\u200a To that end, Monsanto operated the Dayton Project, and later Mound Laboratories, and assisted in the development of the first nuclear weapons.\n\n\n==== Post-WWII ====\nIn 1946, Monsanto developed and marketed \"All\" laundry detergent, which they sold to Lever Brothers in 1957. In 1947, its styrene factory was destroyed in the Texas City Disaster. In 1949, Monsanto acquired American Viscose Corporation from Courtaulds. In 1954, Monsanto partnered with German chemical giant Bayer to form Mobay and market polyurethanes in the United States.Monsanto began manufacturing DDT in 1944, along with some 15 other companies. This insecticide was critical to the fight against malaria-transmitting mosquitoes. Due to DDT's toxicity, it was banned in the United States in 1972.\nIn 1977, Monsanto stopped producing PCBs; Congress banned PCB production two years later.\n\n\n==== 1960s and 1970s ====\nIn the mid\u20111960s, William Standish Knowles and his team invented a way to selectively synthesize enantiomers via asymmetric hydrogenation. This was the first method for the catalytic production of pure chiral compounds. Knowles' team designed the \"first industrial process to chirally synthesize an important compound\"\u2014L\u2011dopa, which is used to treat Parkinson's disease. In 2001, Knowles and Ry\u014dji Noyori won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry. In the mid-1960s, chemists at Monsanto developed the Monsanto process for making acetic acid, which until 2000 was the most widely used production method. In 1964, Monsanto chemists invented AstroTurf (initially ChemGrass).In the 1960s and 1970s, Monsanto was a producer of Agent Orange for United States Armed Forces operations in Vietnam, and settled out of court in a lawsuit brought by veterans in 1984.:\u200a6\u200a In 1968, it became the first company to start mass production of (visible) light-emitting diodes (LEDs), using gallium arsenide phosphide. From 1968 to 1970, sales doubled every few months. Their products (discrete LEDs and seven-segment numeric displays) became industry standards. The primary markets then were electronic calculators, digital watches and digital clocks. Monsanto became a pioneer of optoelectronics in the 1970s.\nBetween 1968 and 1974, the company sponsored the PGA Tour event in Pensacola, Florida, which was renamed the Monsanto Open.\nIn 1974, Harvard University and Monsanto signed a 10-year research grant to support the cancer research of Judah Folkman, which became the largest such arrangement ever made; medical inventions arising from that research were the first for which Harvard allowed its faculty to submit patent application.\n\n\n==== 1980 to 1989: Becoming an agribiotech ====\nMonsanto scientists were among the first to genetically modify a plant cell, publishing their results in 1983. Five years later the company conducted the first field tests of genetically modified crops. Increasing involvement in agricultural biotechnology dates from the installment of Richard Mahoney as Monsanto's CEO in 1983. This involvement increased under the leadership of Robert Shapiro, appointed CEO in 1995, leading ultimately to the disposition of product lines unrelated to agriculture.In 1985, Monsanto acquired G.D. Searle & Company, a life sciences company that focused on pharmaceuticals, agriculture and animal health. In 1993, its Searle division filed a patent application for Celebrex, which in 1998 became the first selective COX\u20112 inhibitor to be approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Celebrex became a blockbuster drug and was often mentioned as a key reason for Pfizer's acquisition of Monsanto's pharmaceutical business in 2002.\n\n\n==== 1990 to 1999: Moving into the seed market & industry consolidation ====\nIn 1994, Monsanto introduced a recombinant version of bovine somatotropin, brand-named Posilac. Monsanto later sold this business to Eli Lilly and Company.\nIn 1996, Monsanto purchased Agracetus, the biotechnology company that had generated the first transgenic cotton, soybeans, peanuts and other crops, and from which Monsanto had been licensing technology since 1991.In 1997, Monsanto divested Solutia, a company created to carry off the responsibility for Monsanto's PCB business and associated liabilities, along with some related organic chemical production.\nMonsanto first entered the maize seed business when it purchased 40% of Dekalb in 1996; it purchased the remainder of the corporation in 1998. In 1997, the company first published an annual report citing Monsanto's Law, a biotechnological take on Moore's Law, indicating its future directions and exponential growth in the use of biotechnology. In the same year, Californian GMO company Calgene was acquired. In 1998, Monsanto purchased Cargill's international seed business, which gave it access to sales and distribution facilities in 51 countries. In 2005, it finalized the purchase of Seminis Inc, a leading global vegetable and fruit seed company, for $1.4 billion. This made it the world's largest conventional seed company.\nIn 1999, Monsanto sold off NutraSweet Co. In December of the same year, Monsanto agreed to merge with Pharmacia & Upjohn, in a deal valuing the transaction at $27 billion. The agricultural division became a wholly owned subsidiary of the \"new\" Pharmacia; Monsanto's medical research division, which included products such as Celebrex.\n\n\n==== \"Pre-Pharmacia\" Monsanto overview ====\n\n\n=== \"Post-Pharmacia\" Monsanto ===\n\n\n==== 2000 to 2009: Birth of the \"new\" Monsanto ====\nIn 2000: Pharmacia spun off its agro-biotech subsidiary into a new company, the \"new Monsanto\", focused on four key agricultural crops\u2014soybeans, maize, wheat and cotton. Monsanto agreed to indemnify Pharmacia against potential liabilities from judgments against Solutia. As a result, the new Monsanto continued to be a party to numerous lawsuits over the prior Monsanto. Pharmacia was bought by Pfizer in 2003.)\nIn 2005, Monsanto acquired Emergent Genetics and its Stoneville and NexGen cotton brands. Emergent was the third-largest U.S. cotton seed company, with about 12% of the U.S. market. Monsanto's goal was to obtain \"a strategic cotton germplasm and traits platform\".Also in 2005, Monsanto purchased Seminis, the California-based world leader in vegetable seed production, for $1.4 billion. Seminis developed new vegetable varieties using advanced cross-pollination methods. Monsanto indicated that Seminis would continue with non-GM development, while not ruling out GM in the longer term.In June 2007, Monsanto purchased Delta and Pine Land Company, a major cotton seed breeder, for $1.5 billion. As a condition for approval from the Department of Justice, Monsanto was obligated to divest its Stoneville cotton business, which it sold to Bayer, and to divest its NexGen cotton business, which it sold to Americot. Monsanto also exited the pig-breeding business by selling Monsanto Choice Genetics to Newsham Genetics LC in November, divesting itself of \"any and all swine-related patents, patent applications, and all other intellectual property\".:\u200a108\u200a In 2007, Monsanto and BASF announced a long-term agreement to cooperate in the research, development, and marketing of new plant biotechnology products.In 2008, Monsanto purchased Dutch seed company De Ruiter Seeds for \u20ac546 million, and sold its POSILAC bovine somatotropin brand and related business to Elanco Animal Health, a division of Eli Lilly & Co, in August for $300 million plus \"additional contingent consideration\".\n\n\n==== 2010 to 2017: Further growth, Syngenta ====\nIn 2012, Monsanto purchased for $210 million Precision Planting Inc., a company that produced computer hardware and software designed to enable farmers to increase yield and productivity through more precise planting.Monsanto purchased San Francisco-based Climate Corp for $930 million in 2013. Climate Corp makes local weather forecasts for farmers based on data modelling and historical data; if the forecasts were wrong, the farmer was compensated.In May 2013, a worldwide protest against Monsanto corporation, called March Against Monsanto, was held in over 400 cities. A second protest took place in May 2014.\nMonsanto tried to acquire Swiss agro-biotechnology rival Syngenta for US$46.5 billion in 2015, but failed. In that year Monsanto was the world's biggest supplier of seeds, controlling 26% of the global seed market (Du Pont was second with 21%). Monsanto was the only manufacturer of white phosphorus for military use in the US.\n\n\n==== \"Post-Pharmacia\" Monsanto overview ====\n\n\n=== Sale to Bayer ===\nIn September 2016, Monsanto (current owner of MiracleGro) agreed to be acquired by Bayer for US$66 billion. In an effort to receive regulatory clearance for the deal, Bayer announced the sale of significant portions of its current agriculture businesses, including its seed and herbicide businesses, to BASF.The deal was approved by the European Union on March 21, 2018, and approved in the United States on May 29, 2018. The sale closed on June 7, 2018; Bayer announced its intent to discontinue the Monsanto name, with the combined company operating solely under the Bayer brand.Under the terms of merger, Bayer promised to maintain Monsanto\u2019s more than 9,000 U.S. jobs and add 3,000 new U.S. high-tech positions.The prospective merger parties said at the time the combined agriculture business planned to spend $16 billion on research and development over the next six years and at least $8 billion on research and development in United States .Bayer would also establish their new global Seeds & Traits and North American commercial headquarters in St. Louis, Missouri.\n\n\n== Products and associated issues ==\n\n\n=== Current products ===\n\n\n==== Glyphosate herbicides ====\n\nFollowing its 1970 introduction, Monsanto's last commercially relevant United States patent on the herbicide glyphosate (brand name RoundUp) expired in 2000. Glyphosate has since been marketed by many agrochemical companies, in various solution strengths and with various adjuvants, under dozens of tradenames. As of 2009, glyphosate represented about 10% of Monsanto's revenue. Roundup-related products (which include genetically modified seeds) represented about half of Monsanto's gross margin.\n\n\n==== Crop seed ====\n\nAs of 2015, Monsanto's line of seed products included corn, cotton, soy and vegetable seeds.\n\n\n==== Row crops ====\nMany of Monsanto's agricultural seed products are genetically modified, such as for resistance to herbicides, including glyphosate and dicamba. Monsanto calls glyphosate-tolerant seeds Roundup Ready. Monsanto's introduction of this system (planting a glyphosate-resistant seed and then applying glyphosate once plants emerged) allowed farmers to increase yield by planting rows closer together. Without it, farmers had to plant rows far enough apart to allow the control of post-emergent weeds with mechanical tillage. Farmers widely adopted the technology\u2014for example over 80% of maize (Mon 832), soybean (MON-\u00d84\u00d832-6), cotton, sugar beet and canola planted in the United States are glyphosate-tolerant. Monsanto developed a Roundup Ready genetically modified wheat (MON 71800) but ended development in 2004 due to concerns from wheat exporters about the rejection of genetically modified (GM) wheat by foreign markets.Two patents were critical to Monsanto's GM soybean business; one expired in 2011 and the other in 2014. The second expiration meant that glyphosate resistant soybeans became \"generic\". The first harvest of generic glyphosate-tolerant soybeans came in 2015. Monsanto broadly licensed the patent to other seed companies that include glyphosate resistance trait in their seed products. About 150 companies have licensed the technology, including competitors Syngenta and DuPont Pioneer.Monsanto invented and sells genetically modified seeds that make a crystalline insecticidal protein from Bacillus thuringiensis, known as Bt. In 1995 Monsanto's potato plants producing Bt toxin were approved by the Environmental Protection Agency, following approval by the FDA, making it the first pesticide-producing crop to be approved in the United States. Monsanto subsequently developed Bt maize (MON 802, MON 809, MON 863, MON 810), Bt soybean and Bt cotton.\nMonsanto produces seed that has multiple genetic modifications, also known as \"stacked traits\"\u2014for instance, cotton that make one or more Bt proteins and is resistant to glyphosate. One of these, created in collaboration with Dow Chemical Company, is called SmartStax. In 2011 Monsanto launched the Genuity brand for its stacked-trait products.As of 2012, the agricultural seed lineup included Roundup Ready alfalfa, canola and sugarbeet; Bt and/or Roundup Ready cotton; sorghum hybrids; soybeans with various oil profiles, most with the Roundup Ready trait; and a wide range of wheat products, many of which incorporate the nontransgenic \"clearfield\" imazamox-tolerant trait from BASF.In 2013 Monsanto launched the first transgenic drought tolerance trait in a line of corn hybrids branded DroughtGard. The MON 87460 trait is provided by the insertion of the cspB gene from the soil microbe Bacillus subtilis; it was approved by the USDA in 2011 and by China in 2013.The \"Xtend Crop System\" includes seed genetically modified to be resistant to both glyphosate and dicamba, and a herbicide product including those two active ingredients. In December 2014, the system was approved for use in the US. In February 2016, China approved the Roundup Ready 2 Xtend system. The lack of European Union approval led many American traders to reject the use of Xtend soybeans over concerns that the new seeds would become mixed with EU-approved seeds, leading Europe to reject American soybean exports.\n\n\n==== India-specific issues ====\nIn 2009, Monsanto scientists discovered insects that had developed resistance to the Bt Cotton planted in Gujarat. Monsanto communicated this to the Indian government and its customers, stating that \"Resistance is natural and expected, so measures to delay resistance are important. Among the factors that may have contributed to pink bollworm resistance to the Cry1Ac protein in Bollgard I in Gujarat are limited refuge planting and early use of unapproved Bt cotton seed, planted prior to GEAC approval of Bollgard I cotton, which may have had lower protein expression levels.\" The company advised farmers to switch to its second generation of Bt cotton \u2013 Bolgard II \u2013 which had two resistance genes instead of one, the widely recognised best practice to forestall, prevent, and cope with any kind of pesticide resistance. However, this advice was criticized: \"an internal analysis of the statement of the Ministry of Environment and Forests says it 'appears that this could be a business strategy to phase out single gene events [that is, the first-generation Bollgard I product] and promote double genes [the second generation Bollgard II] which would fetch higher price.'\"Monsanto's GM cotton seed was the subject of NGO agitation because of its higher cost. Indian farmers crossed GM varieties with local varieties, using plant breeding, violating their agreements with Monsanto. In 2009, high prices of Bt Cotton were blamed for forcing farmers of Jhabua district into debt when the crops died due to lack of rain.\n\n\n==== Vegetables ====\nIn 2012 Monsanto was the world's largest supplier of non-GE vegetable seeds by value, with sales of $800M. 95% of the research and development for vegetable seed is in conventional breeding. The company concentrates on improving flavor. According to their website they sell \"4,000 distinct seed varieties representing more than 20 species\". Broccoli, with the brand name Benefort\u00e9, with increased amounts of glucoraphanin was introduced in 2010 following development by its Seminis subsidiary.\n\n\n=== Former products ===\n\n\n==== Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) ====\nUntil it ended production in 1977, Monsanto was the source of 99% of the polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) used by U.S. industry. They were sold under brand names including Aroclor and Santotherm; the name Santotherm is still used for non-chlorinated products. PCBs are a persistent organic pollutant, and cause cancer in both animals and humans, among other health effects. PCBs were initially welcomed due to the electrical industry's need for durable, safer (than flammable mineral oil) cooling and insulating fluid for industrial transformers and capacitors. PCBs were also commonly used as stabilizing additives in the manufacture of flexible PVC coatings for electrical wiring and in electronic components to enhance PVC heat and fire resistance. As transformer leaks occurred and toxicity problems arose near factories, their durability and toxicity became recognized as serious problems. PCB production was banned by the U.S. Congress in 1979 and by the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants in 2001.\n\n\n==== Agent Orange ====\n\nMonsanto, Dow Chemical, and eight other chemical companies made Agent Orange for the U.S. Department of Defense.:\u200a6\u200a It was given its name from the color of the orange-striped barrels in which it was shipped, and was by far the most widely used of the so-called \"Rainbow Herbicides\".\n\n\n==== Bovine somatotropin ====\n\nMonsanto developed and sold recombinant bovine somatotropin (also known as rBST and rBGH), a synthetic hormone that increases milk production by 11\u201316% when injected into cows. In October 2008, Monsanto sold this business to Eli Lilly for $300 million plus additional considerations.The use of rBST remains controversial with respect to its effects on cows and their milk.In some markets, milk from cows that are not treated with rBST is sold with labels indicating that it is rBST-free: this milk has proved popular with consumers. In reaction to this, in early 2008 a pro-rBST advocacy group called \"American Farmers for the Advancement and Conservation of Technology\" (AFACT), made up of dairies and originally affiliated with Monsanto, formed and began lobbying to ban such labels. AFACT stated that \"absence\" labels can be misleading and imply that milk from cows treated with rBST is inferior.\n\n\n=== Uncommercialized products ===\nMonsanto also developed notable technologies that were not ultimately commercialized.\n\n\n==== \"Terminator\" seeds ====\n\nGenetic use restriction technology, colloquially known as \"terminator technology\", produces plants with sterile seeds. This trait would prevent the spread of those seeds into the wild. It also would prevent farmers from planting seeds they harvest, requiring them to purchase seed for every planting, allowing the company to enforce its licensing terms via technology. Farmers have been buying hybrid seeds for generations, instead of replanting their harvest, because second-generation hybrid seeds are inferior. Nevertheless, most seed companies contract only with farmers who agree not to plant harvested seeds.\nTerminator technology has been developed by governmental labs, university researchers and companies. The technology has not been used commercially. Rumors that Monsanto and other companies intended to introduce terminator technology caused protests, for example in India.In 1999, Monsanto pledged not to commercialize terminator technology. The Delta & Pine Land Company of Mississippi intended to commercialize the technology, but D&PL was acquired by Monsanto in 2007.Monsanto \"Terminator seeds\" were never commercialized nor used in any farmer's field anywhere in the world. The patent expired in 2015.\n\n\n==== GM wheat ====\n\nMonsanto developed several strains of genetically modified wheat, including glyphosate-resistant strains, in the 1990s. Field tests were done in the United States between 1998 and 2005. As of 2017, no genetically modified wheat had been released for commercial use.\n\n\n== Legal affairs ==\n\nMonsanto engaged in high-profile lawsuits, as both plaintiff and defendant. It defended lawsuits mostly over its products' health and environmental effects. Monsanto used the courts to enforce its patents, particularly in agricultural biotechnology, an approach similar to that of other companies in the field, such as Dupont Pioneer and Syngenta. Monsanto also became one of the most vilified large corporations in the world, over a range of issues involving its industrial and agricultural chemical products, and GM seed. In April 2018, just prior to Bayer's acquisition, Bayer indicated that improving Monsanto's reputation represented a major challenge. That June, Bayer announced it would drop the Monsanto name as part of a campaign to regain consumer trust.\n\n\n=== Argentina ===\nArgentina approved Roundup Ready soy in 1996. Between 1996 and 2008 soy production grew from 14 million acres to 42 million acres. The growth was driven by Argentine investors' interest in export markets. The consolidation led to a decrease in production of many staples such as milk, rice, maize, potatoes and lentils. As of 2004, about 150,000 small farmers had left the countryside; as of 2009, 50% in the Chaco region.The Guardian reported that a Monsanto representative had said, \"any problems with GM soya were to do with use of the crop as a monoculture, not because it was GM. If you grow any crop to the exclusion of any other you are bound to get problems.\"In 2005 and 2006, Monsanto attempted to enforce its patents on soymeal originating in Argentina and shipped to Spain by having Spanish customs officials seize the soymeal shipments. The seizures were part of a larger attempt by Monsanto to put pressure on the Argentinian government to enforce Monsanto's seed patents.In 2013 environmentalist groups objected to a Monsanto corn seed conditioning facility in Malvinas Argentinas, C\u00f3rdoba. Neighbours objected to the risk of environmental impact. Court rulings supported the project, but environmentalist groups organised demonstrations and opened an online petition for the subject to be decided in a popular referendum. The court rulings stipulated that while construction could continue, the facility could not begin operating until the environmental impact report required by law had been duly presented.In 2016 Monsanto reached an agreement with Argentina's government on soybean seed royalty payments. Monsanto agreed to give the Argentine Seed Institute (Inase) oversight over crops grown from Monsanto's Intacta genetically modified soybean seeds. Before the agreement, Argentine farmers generally avoided royalties by using seeds from previous harvests or purchased from non-registered suppliers. Inase agreed to delegate testing to grain exchanges. About 6 million sample tests were to be conducted annually. Seeds that appear to be GMOs may be tested again using a polymerase chain reaction test.\n\n\n=== Brazil ===\nBrazil is the second largest producer of GMO soy. In 2003 GM soy was found in fields planted in the state of Rio Grande do Sul. This was a controversial decision, and in response, the Landless Workers' Movement protested by invading and occupying several Monsanto farm plots used for research, training and seed-processing. In 2005 Brazil passed a law creating a regulatory pathway for GM crops.\n\n\n=== China ===\nMonsanto was criticized by Chinese economist Larry Lang for controlling the Chinese soybean market, and for trying to do the same to Chinese corn and cotton.\n\n\n=== India ===\n\nIn the late 1990s and early 2000s, public attention was drawn to suicides by indebted farmers following crop failures. For example, in the early 2000s, farmers in Andhra Pradesh (AP) were in economic crisis due to high-interest rates and crop failures, leading to widespread unrest and farmer suicides. Monsanto was one focus of protests with respect to the price and yields of Bt seed. In 2005, the Genetic Engineering Approval Committee, the Indian regulatory authority, released a study on field tests of certain Bt cotton strains in AP and ruled that Monsanto could not market those strains in AP because of poor yields. At about the same time, the state agriculture minister barred the company from selling Bt cotton seed, because Monsanto refused a request by the state government to provide pay about Rs 4.5 crore (about one million US$) to indebted farmers in some districts, and because the government blamed Monsanto's seeds for crop failures. The order was later lifted.\nIn 2006, AP tried to convince Monsanto to reduce the price of Bt seeds. Unsatisfied, the state filed several cases against Monsanto and its Mumbai-based licensee, Maharashtra Hybrid Seeds. Research by International Food Policy Research Institute found no evidence supporting an increased suicide rate following the introduction of Bt cotton and that Bt cotton. The report stated that farmer suicides predated commercial introduction in 2002 (and unofficial introduction in 2001) and that such suicides had made up a fairly constant portion of the overall national suicide rate since 1997. The report concluded that while Bt cotton may have been a factor in specific suicides, the contribution was likely marginal compared to socio-economic factors. As of 2009, Bt cotton was planted in 87% of Indian cotton-growing land.Critics including Vandana Shiva said that the crop failures could \"often be traced to\" Monsanto's Bt cotton, that the seeds increased farmer indebtedness and argued that Monsanto misrepresented the profitability of their Bt Cotton, causing losses leading to debt. In 2009, Shiva wrote that Indian farmers who had previously spent as little as \u20b97 (rupees) per kilogram were now paying up to \u20b917,000 per kilo per year for Bt cotton. In 2012 the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) and the Central Cotton Research Institute (CCRI) stated that for the first time farmer suicides could be linked to a decline in the performance of Bt cotton, and advised, \"cotton farmers are in a deep crisis since shifting to Bt cotton. The spate of farmer suicides in 2011\u201312 has been particularly severe among Bt cotton farmers.\"In 2004, in response to an order from the Bombay High Court the Tata Institute produced a report on farmer suicides in Maharashtra in 2005. The survey cited \"government apathy, the absence of a safety net for farmers, and lack of access to information related to agriculture as the chief causes for the desperate condition of farmers in the state.\"Various studies identified the important factors as insufficient or risky credit systems, the difficulty of farming semi-arid regions, poor agricultural income, absence of alternative income opportunities, a downturn in the urban economy which forced non-farmers into farming and the absence of suitable counseling services. ICAR and CCRI stated that the cost of cotton cultivation had jumped as a consequence of rising pesticide costs, while total Bt cotton production in the five years from 2007 to 2012 had declined.\n\n\n=== United Kingdom ===\n\nBrofiscin Quarry was used as a waste site from about 1965 to 1972 and accepted waste from BP, Veolia and Monsanto. A 2005 report by Environment Agency Wales (EAW) found that the quarry contained up to 75 toxic substances, including heavy metals, Agent Orange and PCBs.In February 2011, Monsanto agreed to help with the costs of remediation, but did not accept responsibility for the pollution. In 2011, EAW and the Rhondda Cynon Taf council announced that they had decided to place an engineered cap over the waste mass, and stated that the cost would be \u00a31.5 million; previous estimates had been as high as \u00a3100 million.\n\n\n=== United States ===\n\n\n==== PCBs ====\nIn the late 1960s, the Monsanto plant in Sauget, Illinois, was the nation's largest producer of polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) compounds, which remained in the water along Dead Creek there. An EPA official referred to Sauget as \"one of the most polluted communities in the region\" and \"a soup of different chemicals\".In Anniston, Alabama, plaintiffs in a 2002 lawsuit provided documentation showing that the local Monsanto factory knowingly discharged both mercury and PCB-laden waste into local creeks for over 40 years. In 1969 Monsanto dumped 45 tons of PCBs into Snow Creek, a feeder for Choccolocco Creek, which supplies much of the area's drinking water, and buried millions of pounds of PCB in open-pit landfills located on hillsides above the plant and surrounding neighborhoods. In August 2003, Solutia and Monsanto agreed to pay plaintiffs $700 million to settle claims by over 20,000 Anniston residents.In June 2020, Bayer proposed paying $650 million to settle local PCB lawsuits, and $170 million to the attorneys-general of New Mexico, Washington and the District of Columbia. Monsanto was acknowledged at the time of the settlement to have ceased making PCBs in 1977, though State Impact of Pennsylvania reported that this did not stop PCBs from contaminating people many years later. State Impact of Pennsylvania stated \"In 1979, the EPA banned the use of PCBs, but they still exist in some products produced before 1979. They persist in the environment because they bind to sediments and soils. High exposure to PCBs can cause birth defects, developmental delays, and liver changes.\" On November 25, 2020, however U.S. District Judge Fernando M. Olguin rejected the proposed $650 million settlement from Bayer and allowed Monsanto-related lawsuits involving PCB to proceed.\n\n\n==== Polluted sites ====\nAs of November 2013, Monsanto was associated with nine \"active\" Superfund sites and 32 \"archived\" sites in the US, in the EPA's Superfund database. Monsanto was sued and settled multiple times for damaging the health of its employees or residents near its Superfund sites through pollution and poisoning.\n\n\n==== GM wheat ====\nIn 2013 a Monsanto-developed transgenic cultivar of glyphosate-resistant wheat was discovered on a farm in Oregon, growing as a weed or \"volunteer plant\". The final Oregon field test had occurred in 2001. As of May 2013, the GMO seed source was unknown. Volunteer wheat from a former test field two miles away was tested and was not found to be glyphosate-tolerant. Monsanto faced penalties up to $1 million over potential violations of the Plant Protection Act. The discovery threatened world-leading US wheat exports, which totaled $8.1 billion in 2012. This wheat variety was rarely exported to Europe and was more likely destined for Asia. Monsanto said it had destroyed all the material it held after completing trials in 2004 and it was \"mystified\" by its appearance. On June 14, 2013, the USDA announced: \"As of today, USDA has neither found nor been informed of anything that would indicate that this incident amounts to more than a single isolated incident in a single field on a single farm. All information collected so far shows no indication of the presence of GE wheat in commerce.\" As of August 30, 2013, while the source of the GM wheat remained unknown, Japan, South Korea and Taiwan had all resumed placing orders.\n\n\n==== Cancer risks of Roundup ====\nMonsanto has faced controversy in the United States over claims that its herbicide products might be carcinogens. There is limited evidence that human cancer risk might increase as a result of occupational exposure to large amounts of glyphosate, as in agricultural work, but no good evidence of such a risk from home use, such as in domestic gardening. The consensus among national pesticide regulatory agencies and scientific organizations is that labeled uses of glyphosate have demonstrated no evidence of human carcinogenicity. Organizations such as the World Health Organization (WHO), the Food and Agriculture Organization, European Commission, Canadian Pest Management Regulatory Agency, and the German Federal Institute for Risk Assessment have concluded that there is no evidence that glyphosate poses a carcinogenic or genotoxic risk to humans. However, one international scientific organization, the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), affiliated with the WHO, has made claims of carcinogenicity in research reviews; in 2015 the IARC declared glyphosate \"probably carcinogenic\".As of October 30, 2019, there were 42,700 plaintiffs who said that glyphosate herbicides caused their cancer after the IARC report in 2015 linking glyphosate to cancer in humans. Monsanto denies that Roundup is carcinogenic.In March 2017, 40 plaintiffs filed a lawsuit at the Alameda County Superior Court, a branch of the California Superior Court, asking for damages caused by the company's glyphosate-based weed-killers, including Roundup, and demanding a jury trial. On August 10, 2018, Monsanto lost the first decided case. Dewayne Johnson, who has non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, was initially awarded $289 million in damages after a jury in San Francisco said that Monsanto had failed to adequately warn consumers of cancer risks posed by the herbicide. Pending appeal, the award was later reduced to $78.5 million. In November 2018, Monsanto appealed the judgement, asking an appellate court to consider a motion for a new trial. A verdict on the appeal was delivered in June 2020 upholding the verdict but further reducing the award to $21.5 million.On March 27, 2019, Monsanto was found liable in a federal court for Edwin Hardeman's non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and ordered to pay $80 million in damages. A spokesperson for Bayer, by this time the parent company of Monsanto, said the company would appeal the verdict.On May 13, 2019, a jury in California ordered Bayer to pay $2 billion in damages after finding that the company had failed to adequately inform consumers of the possible carcinogenicity of Roundup. On July 26, 2019, an Alameda County judge cut the settlement to $86.7 million, stating that the judgement by the jury exceeded legal precedent.In June 2020, Monsanto acquisitor Bayer agreed to settle over a hundred thousand Roundup cancer lawsuits, agreeing to pay $8.8 to $9.6 billion to settle those claims, and $1.5 billion for any future claims. The settlement does not include three cases that have already gone to jury trials and are being appealed.\n\n\n==== Dicamba lawsuits ====\nFollowing a lawsuit by a peach farmer alleging that Dicamba used as a weed killer drifted in the wind from adjacent crops to destroy his peach orchards, a Missouri trial jury found in February 2020 that Monsanto and codefendant BASF were negligent in design of Dicamba and failed to warn farmers about the product, awarding $15 million for losses and $250 million in punitive damages. On February 14, 2020, the jury involved in a Missouri lawsuit involving tree damage caused by dicamba drift ruled against Bayer and its co-defendant BASF and found in favor of Bader Farms owner Bill Bader. In June 2020, Bayer agreed to a settlement of up to $400 million for all 2015-2020 crop year dicamba claims, not including the $250 million judgement which was issued to Bader. On November 25, 2020, U.S. District Judge Stephen Limbaugh Jr. reduced the punitive damage amount in the Bader Farms case to $60 million.\n\n\n=== Improper accounting for incentive rebates ===\nFrom 2009 to 2011, Monsanto improperly accounted for incentive rebates. The actions inflated Monsanto's reported profit by $31 million over the two years. Monsanto paid $80 million in penalties pursuant to a subsequent settlement with the US Securities and Exchange Commission. Monsanto materially misstated its consolidated earnings in response to losing market share of Roundup to generic producers. Monsanto overhauled its internal controls. Two of their top CPAs were suspended and Monsanto was required to hire, at their expense, an independent ethics/compliance consultant for two years.\n\n\n=== Alleged ghostwriting ===\nA review of glyphosate's carcinogenic potential by four independent expert panels, with a comparison to the IARC assessment, was published in September 2016. Using emails released in August 2017 by plaintiffs' lawyers who are suing Monsanto, Bloomberg Business Week reported that \"Monsanto scientists were heavily involved in organizing, reviewing, and editing drafts submitted by the outside experts.\" A Monsanto spokesperson responded that Monsanto had provided only non-substantive cosmetic copyediting.In 2017, The New York Times reported that a 2015 article attributed to researcher and columnist Henry I. Miller had been drafted by Monsanto. According to the report, Monsanto asked Miller to write an article rebutting the findings of the International Agency for Research on Cancer, and he indicated willingness to do it if he \"could start from a high-quality draft\". Forbes later removed Miller's blog from Forbes.com and ended their relationship.\n\n\n== Government relations ==\n\n\n=== United States ===\nMonsanto regularly lobbied the US government with expenses reaching $8.8 million in 2008  and $6.3 million in 2011. $2 million was spent on matters concerning \"Foreign Agriculture Biotechnology Laws, Regulations, and Trade\". Some US diplomats in Europe at other times worked directly for Monsanto.California's 2012 Proposition 37 would have mandated the disclosure of genetically modified crops used in the production of California food products. Monsanto spent $8.1 million opposing passage, making it the largest contributor against the initiative. The proposition was rejected by a 53.7% majority. Labeling is not required in the US.In 2009 Michael R. Taylor, food safety expert and former Monsanto VP for Public Policy, became a senior advisor to the FDA Commissioner.Monsanto is a member of the Washington D.C based Biotechnology Industry Organization (BIO), the world's largest biotechnology trade association, which provides \"advocacy, business development, and communications services.\" Between 2010 and 2011 BIO spent a total of $16.43 million on lobbying.The Monsanto Company Citizenship Fund aka Monsanto Citizenship Fund is a political action committee that donated over $10 million to various candidates from 2003 to 2013.As of October 2013, Monsanto and DuPont Co. continued backing an anti-labeling campaign, spending roughly $18 million. The state of Washington, along with 26 other states, made proposals in November to require GMO labeling.\n\n\n==== Revolving door ====\nIn the US regulatory environment, many individuals move back and forth between positions in the public and private sectors, including at Monsanto. Critics argued that the connections between the company and the government allowed Monsanto to obtain favorable regulations at the expense of consumer safety. Supporters of the practice point to the benefits of competent and experienced individuals in both sectors and to the importance of appropriately managing potential conflicts of interest.:\u200a16\u201323\u200a The list of such people includes:\n\nLinda J.

He was cleared of conflict of interest accusations. Then he became Monsanto's VP for Public Policy, becoming Senior Advisor to the FDA Commissioner for the Obama administration.\nClarence Thomas\u2014Supreme Court Justice who worked as an attorney for Monsanto in the 1970s, then wrote the majority opinion in J. E. M. Ag Supply, Inc. v. Pioneer Hi-Bred International, Inc. finding that \"newly developed plant breeds are patentable under the general utility patent laws of the United States.\"\nAnn Veneman\u2014Secretary of the Department of Agriculture, and member of the board of directors of Calgene\n\n\n=== United Kingdom ===\nDuring the late 1990s, Monsanto lobbied to raise permitted glyphosate levels in soybeans and was successful in convincing Codex Alimentarius and both the UK and US governments to lift levels 200 times to 20 milligrams per kilogram of soya.:\u200a265\u200a When asked how negotiations with Monsanto were conducted, Lord Donoughue, then the Labour Party Agriculture minister in the House of Lords, stated that all information relating to the matter would be \"kept secret\".:\u200a265\u200a During the 24 months prior to the 1997 British election Monsanto representatives had 22 meetings at the departments of Agriculture and the Environment.:\u200a266\u200a Stanley Greenberg, an election advisor to Tony Blair, later worked as a Monsanto consultant.:\u200a266\u200a Former Labour spokesperson David Hill, became Monsanto's media adviser at the lobbying firm Bell Pottinger.:\u200a266\u200a The Labour government was challenged in Parliament about \"trips, facilities, gifts and other offerings of financial value provided by Monsanto to civil servants\", but only acknowledged that Department of Trade and Industry had two working lunches with Monsanto.:\u200a267\u200a Peter Luff, then a Conservative Party MP and Chairman of the Agriculture Select Committee, received up to \u00a310,000 a year from Bell Pottinger on behalf of Monsanto.:\u200a266\u200a\n\n\n=== European Union ===\nIn January 2011, WikiLeaks documents suggested that US diplomats in Europe responded to a request for help from the Spanish government. One report stated, \"In addition, the cables show US diplomats working directly for GM companies such as Monsanto. 'In response to recent urgent requests by [Spanish rural affairs ministry] state secretary Josep Puxeu and Monsanto, post requests renewed US government support of Spain's science-based agricultural biotechnology position through high-level US government intervention.'\" The leaked documents showed that in 2009, when the Spanish government's policy approving MON810 was under pressure from EU interests, Monsanto's Director for Biotechnology for Spain and Portugal requested that the US government support Spain on the matter. The leaks indicated that Spain and the US had worked closely together to \"persuade the EU not to strengthen biotechnology laws\". Spain was viewed as a key GMO supporter and a leading indicator of support across the continent. The leaks also revealed that in response to an attempt by France to ban MON810 in late 2007, then-US ambassador to France, Craig Roberts Stapleton, asked Washington to \"calibrate a targeted retaliation list that [would cause] some pain across the EU\", targeting countries that did not support the use of GM crops. This activity transpired after the US, Australia, Argentina, Brazil, Canada, India, Mexico and New Zealand had brought an action against Europe via the World Trade Organization with respect to the EU's banning of GMOs; in 2006, the WTO had ruled against the EU.Monsanto was a member of EuropaBio, the leading biotechnology trade group in Europe. One of EuropaBio's initiatives is \"Transforming Europe's position on GM food\". It found \"an urgent need to reshape the terms of the debate about GM in Europe\". EuropaBio proposed the recruitment of high-profile \"ambassadors\" to lobby EU officials.In September 2017 Monsanto lobbyists were banned from the European parliament after the Monsanto refused to attend a parliamentary hearing into allegations of regulatory interference.\n\n\n=== Haiti ===\nAfter the 2010 Haiti earthquake, Monsanto donated $255,000 for disaster relief and 60,000 seed sacks (475 tons) of hybrid (non-GM) corn and vegetable seeds worth $4 million. However, a Catholic Relief Services (CRS) rapid assessment of seed supply and demand for the five most common food security crops found that the Haitians had enough seed and recommended that imported seeds be introduced only on a small scale. Emmanuel Prophete, head of Haiti's Ministry of Agriculture's Service National Semencier (SNS), stated that SNS was not opposed to the hybrid maize seeds because they at least double yields. Louise Sperling, Principal Researcher at the International Center for Tropical Agriculture (CIAT) told HGW that she was not opposed to hybrids, but noted that most hybrids required extra water and better soils and that most of Haiti was not appropriate for hybrids.\nActivists objected that some of the seeds were coated with the fungicides Maxim or thiram. In the United States, pesticides containing thiram are banned in home garden products because most home gardeners do not have adequate protection. Activists wrote that the coated seeds were handled in a dangerous manner by the recipients.The donated seeds were sold at a reduced price in local markets. However, farmers feared that they were being given seeds that would \"threaten local varieties\" and an estimated 8,000\u201312,000 farmers attended a protest of the donation on June 4, 2010, organized by a Haitian farmers' association, the Peasant Movement of Papay, where a small pile of seeds was symbolically burned.\n\n\n== Public relations ==\nMonsanto has engaged in various public relations campaigns to improve its image and public perception of some of its products. These include developing a relationship with scientist Richard Doll with respect to Agent Orange. Other campaigns include the joint funding with other biotech companies for the website GMO Answers.\n\n\n=== Sponsorships ===\nDisneyland attractions, namely:\nHall of Chemistry (1955 to 1966)\nMonsanto House of the Future (from 1957 to 1967)\nFashions and Fabrics through the Years (from 1965 to 1966)\nAdventure Thru Inner Space (from 1967 to 1986)\nMonsanto has donated $10 million to the Missouri Botanical Garden in St. Louis since the 1970s, which named its 1998 plant science facility the 'Monsanto Center'.\nField Museum\nGregor Mendel exhibit and \"Underground Adventures\" since 2011 \"about the importance and fragility of the ecosystem within soil\".\n\"Monsanto Environmental Education Initiative\", led by Gregory M. Mueller\nChair of the Department of Botany and Associate Curator of Mycology\nStaff of the Field Museum, such as Curator Mark W. Westneat, attended Monsanto meetings\nMonsanto Insectarium at the St. Louis Zoo, in St. Louis, Missouri\n\n\n== University relationships ==\nMonsanto was a major funder of science research at Washington University in St. Louis for many years. This research was highlighted by the Washington University/Monsanto Biomedical Research Agreement, which brought more than $100 million of research funding to the university. Washington University built the Monsanto Laboratory of the Life Sciences in 1965. In 2015, Monsanto gave Washington University's Institute for School Partnership a $1.94 million grant to help better teach students in STEM fields.\n\n\n== Awards ==\nIn 2009 Monsanto was chosen as Forbes magazine's company of the year. In 2010 Swiss research firm Covalence rated Monsanto least ethical of 581 multinational corporations based on their EthicalQuote reputation tracking index which \"aggregates thousands of positive and negative news items published by the media, companies, and stakeholders\". without attempt to validate sources. The journal Science ranked Monsanto in its Top 20 Employers list between 2011 and 2014. In 2012, it described the company as \"innovative leader in the industry\", \"makes changes needed\" and \"does important quality research\". Monsanto executive Robert Fraley won the World Food Prize for \"breakthrough achievements in founding, developing, and applying modern agricultural biotechnology\".\n\n\n== Documentaries ==\nBitter Seeds\nFood, Inc.\nThe Future of Food\nThe World According to Monsanto\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nBiological patents in the United States\nDuPont Pioneer\nGenetically modified food controversies\nIndustrial Bio-Test Laboratories\nMonsanto legal cases\nTemporal analysis of products\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nEhrlich, Walter (1997).

Monsanto's best known product is Roundup, a glyphosate-based herbicide, developed in the 1970s. Later the company became a major producer of genetically engineered crops. In 2018, the company ranked 199th on the Fortune 500 of the largest United States corporations by revenue.Monsanto was one of four groups to introduce genes into plants in 1983, and was among the first to conduct field trials of genetically modified crops in 1987. It was one of the top 10 US chemical companies until it divested most of its chemical businesses between 1997 and 2002, through a process of mergers and spin-offs that focused the company on biotechnology. Monsanto was one of the first companies to apply the biotechnology industry business model to agriculture, using techniques developed by biotech drug companies.:\u200a2\u20136\u200a In this business model, companies recoup R&D expenses by exploiting biological patents.Monsanto's roles in agricultural changes, biotechnology products, lobbying of government agencies, and roots as a chemical company have resulted in controversies. The company once manufactured controversial products such as the insecticide DDT, PCBs, Agent Orange, and recombinant bovine growth hormone. Its seed patenting model was criticized as biopiracy and a threat to biodiversity as invasive species.In September 2016, German chemical company Bayer announced its intent to acquire Monsanto for US$66 billion in an all-cash deal. After gaining US and EU regulatory approval, the sale was completed on June 7, 2018. The name Monsanto was no longer used, but Monsanto's previous product brand names were maintained. In June 2020, Bayer agreed to pay numerous settlements in lawsuits involving Monsanto products Roundup, PCBs and Dicamba.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== \"Pre-Pharmacia\" Monsanto ===\n\n\n==== 1901 to WWII ====\nIn 1901 Monsanto was founded in St. Louis, Missouri, as a chemical company. The founder was John Francis Queeny, who at age 42 was a 30\u2011year veteran of the nascent pharmaceutical industry. He funded the firm with his own money and capital from a soft drink distributor. He used for the company name, the maiden name of his wife, Olga M\u00e9ndez Monsanto, who was a scioness of the Sephardic Jewish Monsanto family. The company's first products were commodity food additives, such as the artificial sweetener saccharin, caffeine and vanillin.:\u200a6\u200aMonsanto expanded to Europe in 1919 in a partnership with Graesser's Chemical Works at Cefn Mawr, Wales. The venture produced vanillin, aspirin and its raw ingredient salicylic acid, and later rubber processing chemicals. In the 1920s, Monsanto expanded into basic industrial chemicals such as sulfuric acid and PCBs. Queeny's son Edgar Monsanto Queeny took over the company in 1928. In 1926 the company founded and incorporated a town called Monsanto in Illinois (now known as Sauget). It was formed to provide minimal regulation and low taxes for Monsanto plants at a time when local jurisdictions had most of the responsibility for environmental rules. It was renamed in honor of Leo Sauget, its first village president.In 1935, Monsanto bought the Swann Chemical Company in Anniston, Alabama, and thereby entered the business of producing PCBs.In 1936, Monsanto acquired Thomas & Hochwalt Laboratories in Dayton, Ohio, to acquire the expertise of Charles Allen Thomas and Carroll A. Hochwalt. The acquisition became Monsanto's Central Research Department.:\u200a340\u2013341\u200a Thomas spent the rest of his career at Monsanto, serving as President (1951\u20131960) and Board Chair (1960\u20131965). He retired in 1970. In 1943, Thomas was called to a meeting in Washington, D.C., with Leslie Groves, commander of the Manhattan Project, and James Conant, president of Harvard University and chairman of the National Defense Research Committee (NDRC). They urged Thomas to become co-director of the Manhattan Project at Los Alamos with Robert Oppenheimer, but Thomas was reluctant to leave Dayton and Monsanto. He joined the NDRC, and Monsanto's Central Research Department began to conduct related research.:\u200avii\u200a To that end, Monsanto operated the Dayton Project, and later Mound Laboratories, and assisted in the development of the first nuclear weapons.\n\n\n==== Post-WWII ====\nIn 1946, Monsanto developed and marketed \"All\" laundry detergent, which they sold to Lever Brothers in 1957. In 1947, its styrene factory was destroyed in the Texas City Disaster. In 1949, Monsanto acquired American Viscose Corporation from Courtaulds. In 1954, Monsanto partnered with German chemical giant Bayer to form Mobay and market polyurethanes in the United States.Monsanto began manufacturing DDT in 1944, along with some 15 other companies. This insecticide was critical to the fight against malaria-transmitting mosquitoes. Due to DDT's toxicity, it was banned in the United States in 1972.\nIn 1977, Monsanto stopped producing PCBs; Congress banned PCB production two years later.\n\n\n==== 1960s and 1970s ====\nIn the mid\u20111960s, William Standish Knowles and his team invented a way to selectively synthesize enantiomers via asymmetric hydrogenation. This was the first method for the catalytic production of pure chiral compounds. Knowles' team designed the \"first industrial process to chirally synthesize an important compound\"\u2014L\u2011dopa, which is used to treat Parkinson's disease. In 2001, Knowles and Ry\u014dji Noyori won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry. In the mid-1960s, chemists at Monsanto developed the Monsanto process for making acetic acid, which until 2000 was the most widely used production method. In 1964, Monsanto chemists invented AstroTurf (initially ChemGrass).In the 1960s and 1970s, Monsanto was a producer of Agent Orange for United States Armed Forces operations in Vietnam, and settled out of court in a lawsuit brought by veterans in 1984.:\u200a6\u200a In 1968, it became the first company to start mass production of (visible) light-emitting diodes (LEDs), using gallium arsenide phosphide. From 1968 to 1970, sales doubled every few months. Their products (discrete LEDs and seven-segment numeric displays) became industry standards. The primary markets then were electronic calculators, digital watches and digital clocks. Monsanto became a pioneer of optoelectronics in the 1970s.\nBetween 1968 and 1974, the company sponsored the PGA Tour event in Pensacola, Florida, which was renamed the Monsanto Open.\nIn 1974, Harvard University and Monsanto signed a 10-year research grant to support the cancer research of Judah Folkman, which became the largest such arrangement ever made; medical inventions arising from that research were the first for which Harvard allowed its faculty to submit patent application.\n\n\n==== 1980 to 1989: Becoming an agribiotech ====\nMonsanto scientists were among the first to genetically modify a plant cell, publishing their results in 1983. Five years later the company conducted the first field tests of genetically modified crops. Increasing involvement in agricultural biotechnology dates from the installment of Richard Mahoney as Monsanto's CEO in 1983. This involvement increased under the leadership of Robert Shapiro, appointed CEO in 1995, leading ultimately to the disposition of product lines unrelated to agriculture.In 1985, Monsanto acquired G.D. Searle & Company, a life sciences company that focused on pharmaceuticals, agriculture and animal health. In 1993, its Searle division filed a patent application for Celebrex, which in 1998 became the first selective COX\u20112 inhibitor to be approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Celebrex became a blockbuster drug and was often mentioned as a key reason for Pfizer's acquisition of Monsanto's pharmaceutical business in 2002.\n\n\n==== 1990 to 1999: Moving into the seed market & industry consolidation ====\nIn 1994, Monsanto introduced a recombinant version of bovine somatotropin, brand-named Posilac. Monsanto later sold this business to Eli Lilly and Company.\nIn 1996, Monsanto purchased Agracetus, the biotechnology company that had generated the first transgenic cotton, soybeans, peanuts and other crops, and from which Monsanto had been licensing technology since 1991.In 1997, Monsanto divested Solutia, a company created to carry off the responsibility for Monsanto's PCB business and associated liabilities, along with some related organic chemical production.\nMonsanto first entered the maize seed business when it purchased 40% of Dekalb in 1996; it purchased the remainder of the corporation in 1998. In 1997, the company first published an annual report citing Monsanto's Law, a biotechnological take on Moore's Law, indicating its future directions and exponential growth in the use of biotechnology. In the same year, Californian GMO company Calgene was acquired. In 1998, Monsanto purchased Cargill's international seed business, which gave it access to sales and distribution facilities in 51 countries. In 2005, it finalized the purchase of Seminis Inc, a leading global vegetable and fruit seed company, for $1.4 billion. This made it the world's largest conventional seed company.\nIn 1999, Monsanto sold off NutraSweet Co. In December of the same year, Monsanto agreed to merge with Pharmacia & Upjohn, in a deal valuing the transaction at $27 billion. The agricultural division became a wholly owned subsidiary of the \"new\" Pharmacia; Monsanto's medical research division, which included products such as Celebrex.\n\n\n==== \"Pre-Pharmacia\" Monsanto overview ====\n\n\n=== \"Post-Pharmacia\" Monsanto ===\n\n\n==== 2000 to 2009: Birth of the \"new\" Monsanto ====\nIn 2000: Pharmacia spun off its agro-biotech subsidiary into a new company, the \"new Monsanto\", focused on four key agricultural crops\u2014soybeans, maize, wheat and cotton. Monsanto agreed to indemnify Pharmacia against potential liabilities from judgments against Solutia. As a result, the new Monsanto continued to be a party to numerous lawsuits over the prior Monsanto. Pharmacia was bought by Pfizer in 2003.)\nIn 2005, Monsanto acquired Emergent Genetics and its Stoneville and NexGen cotton brands. Emergent was the third-largest U.S. cotton seed company, with about 12% of the U.S. market. Monsanto's goal was to obtain \"a strategic cotton germplasm and traits platform\".Also in 2005, Monsanto purchased Seminis, the California-based world leader in vegetable seed production, for $1.4 billion. Seminis developed new vegetable varieties using advanced cross-pollination methods. Monsanto indicated that Seminis would continue with non-GM development, while not ruling out GM in the longer term.In June 2007, Monsanto purchased Delta and Pine Land Company, a major cotton seed breeder, for $1.5 billion. As a condition for approval from the Department of Justice, Monsanto was obligated to divest its Stoneville cotton business, which it sold to Bayer, and to divest its NexGen cotton business, which it sold to Americot. Monsanto also exited the pig-breeding business by selling Monsanto Choice Genetics to Newsham Genetics LC in November, divesting itself of \"any and all swine-related patents, patent applications, and all other intellectual property\".:\u200a108\u200a In 2007, Monsanto and BASF announced a long-term agreement to cooperate in the research, development, and marketing of new plant biotechnology products.In 2008, Monsanto purchased Dutch seed company De Ruiter Seeds for \u20ac546 million, and sold its POSILAC bovine somatotropin brand and related business to Elanco Animal Health, a division of Eli Lilly & Co, in August for $300 million plus \"additional contingent consideration\".\n\n\n==== 2010 to 2017: Further growth, Syngenta ====\nIn 2012, Monsanto purchased for $210 million Precision Planting Inc., a company that produced computer hardware and software designed to enable farmers to increase yield and productivity through more precise planting.Monsanto purchased San Francisco-based Climate Corp for $930 million in 2013. Climate Corp makes local weather forecasts for farmers based on data modelling and historical data; if the forecasts were wrong, the farmer was compensated.In May 2013, a worldwide protest against Monsanto corporation, called March Against Monsanto, was held in over 400 cities. A second protest took place in May 2014.\nMonsanto tried to acquire Swiss agro-biotechnology rival Syngenta for US$46.5 billion in 2015, but failed. In that year Monsanto was the world's biggest supplier of seeds, controlling 26% of the global seed market (Du Pont was second with 21%). Monsanto was the only manufacturer of white phosphorus for military use in the US.\n\n\n==== \"Post-Pharmacia\" Monsanto overview ====\n\n\n=== Sale to Bayer ===\nIn September 2016, Monsanto (current owner of MiracleGro) agreed to be acquired by Bayer for US$66 billion. In an effort to receive regulatory clearance for the deal, Bayer announced the sale of significant portions of its current agriculture businesses, including its seed and herbicide businesses, to BASF.The deal was approved by the European Union on March 21, 2018, and approved in the United States on May 29, 2018. The sale closed on June 7, 2018; Bayer announced its intent to discontinue the Monsanto name, with the combined company operating solely under the Bayer brand.Under the terms of merger, Bayer promised to maintain Monsanto\u2019s more than 9,000 U.S. jobs and add 3,000 new U.S. high-tech positions.The prospective merger parties said at the time the combined agriculture business planned to spend $16 billion on research and development over the next six years and at least $8 billion on research and development in United States .Bayer would also establish their new global Seeds & Traits and North American commercial headquarters in St. Louis, Missouri.\n\n\n== Products and associated issues ==\n\n\n=== Current products ===\n\n\n==== Glyphosate herbicides ====\n\nFollowing its 1970 introduction, Monsanto's last commercially relevant United States patent on the herbicide glyphosate (brand name RoundUp) expired in 2000. Glyphosate has since been marketed by many agrochemical companies, in various solution strengths and with various adjuvants, under dozens of tradenames. As of 2009, glyphosate represented about 10% of Monsanto's revenue. Roundup-related products (which include genetically modified seeds) represented about half of Monsanto's gross margin.\n\n\n==== Crop seed ====\n\nAs of 2015, Monsanto's line of seed products included corn, cotton, soy and vegetable seeds.\n\n\n==== Row crops ====\nMany of Monsanto's agricultural seed products are genetically modified, such as for resistance to herbicides, including glyphosate and dicamba. Monsanto calls glyphosate-tolerant seeds Roundup Ready. Monsanto's introduction of this system (planting a glyphosate-resistant seed and then applying glyphosate once plants emerged) allowed farmers to increase yield by planting rows closer together. Without it, farmers had to plant rows far enough apart to allow the control of post-emergent weeds with mechanical tillage. Farmers widely adopted the technology\u2014for example over 80% of maize (Mon 832), soybean (MON-\u00d84\u00d832-6), cotton, sugar beet and canola planted in the United States are glyphosate-tolerant. Monsanto developed a Roundup Ready genetically modified wheat (MON 71800) but ended development in 2004 due to concerns from wheat exporters about the rejection of genetically modified (GM) wheat by foreign markets.Two patents were critical to Monsanto's GM soybean business; one expired in 2011 and the other in 2014. The second expiration meant that glyphosate resistant soybeans became \"generic\". The first harvest of generic glyphosate-tolerant soybeans came in 2015. Monsanto broadly licensed the patent to other seed companies that include glyphosate resistance trait in their seed products. About 150 companies have licensed the technology, including competitors Syngenta and DuPont Pioneer.Monsanto invented and sells genetically modified seeds that make a crystalline insecticidal protein from Bacillus thuringiensis, known as Bt. In 1995 Monsanto's potato plants producing Bt toxin were approved by the Environmental Protection Agency, following approval by the FDA, making it the first pesticide-producing crop to be approved in the United States. Monsanto subsequently developed Bt maize (MON 802, MON 809, MON 863, MON 810), Bt soybean and Bt cotton.\nMonsanto produces seed that has multiple genetic modifications, also known as \"stacked traits\"\u2014for instance, cotton that make one or more Bt proteins and is resistant to glyphosate. One of these, created in collaboration with Dow Chemical Company, is called SmartStax. In 2011 Monsanto launched the Genuity brand for its stacked-trait products.As of 2012, the agricultural seed lineup included Roundup Ready alfalfa, canola and sugarbeet; Bt and/or Roundup Ready cotton; sorghum hybrids; soybeans with various oil profiles, most with the Roundup Ready trait; and a wide range of wheat products, many of which incorporate the nontransgenic \"clearfield\" imazamox-tolerant trait from BASF.In 2013 Monsanto launched the first transgenic drought tolerance trait in a line of corn hybrids branded DroughtGard. The MON 87460 trait is provided by the insertion of the cspB gene from the soil microbe Bacillus subtilis; it was approved by the USDA in 2011 and by China in 2013.The \"Xtend Crop System\" includes seed genetically modified to be resistant to both glyphosate and dicamba, and a herbicide product including those two active ingredients. In December 2014, the system was approved for use in the US. In February 2016, China approved the Roundup Ready 2 Xtend system. The lack of European Union approval led many American traders to reject the use of Xtend soybeans over concerns that the new seeds would become mixed with EU-approved seeds, leading Europe to reject American soybean exports.\n\n\n==== India-specific issues ====\nIn 2009, Monsanto scientists discovered insects that had developed resistance to the Bt Cotton planted in Gujarat. Monsanto communicated this to the Indian government and its customers, stating that \"Resistance is natural and expected, so measures to delay resistance are important. Among the factors that may have contributed to pink bollworm resistance to the Cry1Ac protein in Bollgard I in Gujarat are limited refuge planting and early use of unapproved Bt cotton seed, planted prior to GEAC approval of Bollgard I cotton, which may have had lower protein expression levels.\" The company advised farmers to switch to its second generation of Bt cotton \u2013 Bolgard II \u2013 which had two resistance genes instead of one, the widely recognised best practice to forestall, prevent, and cope with any kind of pesticide resistance. However, this advice was criticized: \"an internal analysis of the statement of the Ministry of Environment and Forests says it 'appears that this could be a business strategy to phase out single gene events [that is, the first-generation Bollgard I product] and promote double genes [the second generation Bollgard II] which would fetch higher price.'\"Monsanto's GM cotton seed was the subject of NGO agitation because of its higher cost. Indian farmers crossed GM varieties with local varieties, using plant breeding, violating their agreements with Monsanto. In 2009, high prices of Bt Cotton were blamed for forcing farmers of Jhabua district into debt when the crops died due to lack of rain.\n\n\n==== Vegetables ====\nIn 2012 Monsanto was the world's largest supplier of non-GE vegetable seeds by value, with sales of $800M. 95% of the research and development for vegetable seed is in conventional breeding. The company concentrates on improving flavor. According to their website they sell \"4,000 distinct seed varieties representing more than 20 species\". Broccoli, with the brand name Benefort\u00e9, with increased amounts of glucoraphanin was introduced in 2010 following development by its Seminis subsidiary.\n\n\n=== Former products ===\n\n\n==== Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) ====\nUntil it ended production in 1977, Monsanto was the source of 99% of the polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) used by U.S. industry. They were sold under brand names including Aroclor and Santotherm; the name Santotherm is still used for non-chlorinated products. PCBs are a persistent organic pollutant, and cause cancer in both animals and humans, among other health effects. PCBs were initially welcomed due to the electrical industry's need for durable, safer (than flammable mineral oil) cooling and insulating fluid for industrial transformers and capacitors. PCBs were also commonly used as stabilizing additives in the manufacture of flexible PVC coatings for electrical wiring and in electronic components to enhance PVC heat and fire resistance. As transformer leaks occurred and toxicity problems arose near factories, their durability and toxicity became recognized as serious problems. PCB production was banned by the U.S. Congress in 1979 and by the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants in 2001.\n\n\n==== Agent Orange ====\n\nMonsanto, Dow Chemical, and eight other chemical companies made Agent Orange for the U.S. Department of Defense.:\u200a6\u200a It was given its name from the color of the orange-striped barrels in which it was shipped, and was by far the most widely used of the so-called \"Rainbow Herbicides\".\n\n\n==== Bovine somatotropin ====\n\nMonsanto developed and sold recombinant bovine somatotropin (also known as rBST and rBGH), a synthetic hormone that increases milk production by 11\u201316% when injected into cows. In October 2008, Monsanto sold this business to Eli Lilly for $300 million plus additional considerations.The use of rBST remains controversial with respect to its effects on cows and their milk.In some markets, milk from cows that are not treated with rBST is sold with labels indicating that it is rBST-free: this milk has proved popular with consumers. In reaction to this, in early 2008 a pro-rBST advocacy group called \"American Farmers for the Advancement and Conservation of Technology\" (AFACT), made up of dairies and originally affiliated with Monsanto, formed and began lobbying to ban such labels. AFACT stated that \"absence\" labels can be misleading and imply that milk from cows treated with rBST is inferior.\n\n\n=== Uncommercialized products ===\nMonsanto also developed notable technologies that were not ultimately commercialized.\n\n\n==== \"Terminator\" seeds ====\n\nGenetic use restriction technology, colloquially known as \"terminator technology\", produces plants with sterile seeds. This trait would prevent the spread of those seeds into the wild. It also would prevent farmers from planting seeds they harvest, requiring them to purchase seed for every planting, allowing the company to enforce its licensing terms via technology. Farmers have been buying hybrid seeds for generations, instead of replanting their harvest, because second-generation hybrid seeds are inferior. Nevertheless, most seed companies contract only with farmers who agree not to plant harvested seeds.\nTerminator technology has been developed by governmental labs, university researchers and companies. The technology has not been used commercially. Rumors that Monsanto and other companies intended to introduce terminator technology caused protests, for example in India.In 1999, Monsanto pledged not to commercialize terminator technology. The Delta & Pine Land Company of Mississippi intended to commercialize the technology, but D&PL was acquired by Monsanto in 2007.Monsanto \"Terminator seeds\" were never commercialized nor used in any farmer's field anywhere in the world. The patent expired in 2015.\n\n\n==== GM wheat ====\n\nMonsanto developed several strains of genetically modified wheat, including glyphosate-resistant strains, in the 1990s. Field tests were done in the United States between 1998 and 2005. As of 2017, no genetically modified wheat had been released for commercial use.\n\n\n== Legal affairs ==\n\nMonsanto engaged in high-profile lawsuits, as both plaintiff and defendant. It defended lawsuits mostly over its products' health and environmental effects. Monsanto used the courts to enforce its patents, particularly in agricultural biotechnology, an approach similar to that of other companies in the field, such as Dupont Pioneer and Syngenta. Monsanto also became one of the most vilified large corporations in the world, over a range of issues involving its industrial and agricultural chemical products, and GM seed. In April 2018, just prior to Bayer's acquisition, Bayer indicated that improving Monsanto's reputation represented a major challenge. That June, Bayer announced it would drop the Monsanto name as part of a campaign to regain consumer trust.\n\n\n=== Argentina ===\nArgentina approved Roundup Ready soy in 1996. Between 1996 and 2008 soy production grew from 14 million acres to 42 million acres. The growth was driven by Argentine investors' interest in export markets. The consolidation led to a decrease in production of many staples such as milk, rice, maize, potatoes and lentils. As of 2004, about 150,000 small farmers had left the countryside; as of 2009, 50% in the Chaco region.The Guardian reported that a Monsanto representative had said, \"any problems with GM soya were to do with use of the crop as a monoculture, not because it was GM. If you grow any crop to the exclusion of any other you are bound to get problems.\"In 2005 and 2006, Monsanto attempted to enforce its patents on soymeal originating in Argentina and shipped to Spain by having Spanish customs officials seize the soymeal shipments. The seizures were part of a larger attempt by Monsanto to put pressure on the Argentinian government to enforce Monsanto's seed patents.In 2013 environmentalist groups objected to a Monsanto corn seed conditioning facility in Malvinas Argentinas, C\u00f3rdoba. Neighbours objected to the risk of environmental impact. Court rulings supported the project, but environmentalist groups organised demonstrations and opened an online petition for the subject to be decided in a popular referendum. The court rulings stipulated that while construction could continue, the facility could not begin operating until the environmental impact report required by law had been duly presented.In 2016 Monsanto reached an agreement with Argentina's government on soybean seed royalty payments. Monsanto agreed to give the Argentine Seed Institute (Inase) oversight over crops grown from Monsanto's Intacta genetically modified soybean seeds. Before the agreement, Argentine farmers generally avoided royalties by using seeds from previous harvests or purchased from non-registered suppliers. Inase agreed to delegate testing to grain exchanges. About 6 million sample tests were to be conducted annually. Seeds that appear to be GMOs may be tested again using a polymerase chain reaction test.\n\n\n=== Brazil ===\nBrazil is the second largest producer of GMO soy. In 2003 GM soy was found in fields planted in the state of Rio Grande do Sul. This was a controversial decision, and in response, the Landless Workers' Movement protested by invading and occupying several Monsanto farm plots used for research, training and seed-processing. In 2005 Brazil passed a law creating a regulatory pathway for GM crops.\n\n\n=== China ===\nMonsanto was criticized by Chinese economist Larry Lang for controlling the Chinese soybean market, and for trying to do the same to Chinese corn and cotton.\n\n\n=== India ===\n\nIn the late 1990s and early 2000s, public attention was drawn to suicides by indebted farmers following crop failures. For example, in the early 2000s, farmers in Andhra Pradesh (AP) were in economic crisis due to high-interest rates and crop failures, leading to widespread unrest and farmer suicides. Monsanto was one focus of protests with respect to the price and yields of Bt seed. In 2005, the Genetic Engineering Approval Committee, the Indian regulatory authority, released a study on field tests of certain Bt cotton strains in AP and ruled that Monsanto could not market those strains in AP because of poor yields. At about the same time, the state agriculture minister barred the company from selling Bt cotton seed, because Monsanto refused a request by the state government to provide pay about Rs 4.5 crore (about one million US$) to indebted farmers in some districts, and because the government blamed Monsanto's seeds for crop failures. The order was later lifted.\nIn 2006, AP tried to convince Monsanto to reduce the price of Bt seeds. Unsatisfied, the state filed several cases against Monsanto and its Mumbai-based licensee, Maharashtra Hybrid Seeds. Research by International Food Policy Research Institute found no evidence supporting an increased suicide rate following the introduction of Bt cotton and that Bt cotton. The report stated that farmer suicides predated commercial introduction in 2002 (and unofficial introduction in 2001) and that such suicides had made up a fairly constant portion of the overall national suicide rate since 1997. The report concluded that while Bt cotton may have been a factor in specific suicides, the contribution was likely marginal compared to socio-economic factors. As of 2009, Bt cotton was planted in 87% of Indian cotton-growing land.Critics including Vandana Shiva said that the crop failures could \"often be traced to\" Monsanto's Bt cotton, that the seeds increased farmer indebtedness and argued that Monsanto misrepresented the profitability of their Bt Cotton, causing losses leading to debt. In 2009, Shiva wrote that Indian farmers who had previously spent as little as \u20b97 (rupees) per kilogram were now paying up to \u20b917,000 per kilo per year for Bt cotton. In 2012 the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) and the Central Cotton Research Institute (CCRI) stated that for the first time farmer suicides could be linked to a decline in the performance of Bt cotton, and advised, \"cotton farmers are in a deep crisis since shifting to Bt cotton. The spate of farmer suicides in 2011\u201312 has been particularly severe among Bt cotton farmers.\"In 2004, in response to an order from the Bombay High Court the Tata Institute produced a report on farmer suicides in Maharashtra in 2005. The survey cited \"government apathy, the absence of a safety net for farmers, and lack of access to information related to agriculture as the chief causes for the desperate condition of farmers in the state.\"Various studies identified the important factors as insufficient or risky credit systems, the difficulty of farming semi-arid regions, poor agricultural income, absence of alternative income opportunities, a downturn in the urban economy which forced non-farmers into farming and the absence of suitable counseling services. ICAR and CCRI stated that the cost of cotton cultivation had jumped as a consequence of rising pesticide costs, while total Bt cotton production in the five years from 2007 to 2012 had declined.\n\n\n=== United Kingdom ===\n\nBrofiscin Quarry was used as a waste site from about 1965 to 1972 and accepted waste from BP, Veolia and Monsanto. A 2005 report by Environment Agency Wales (EAW) found that the quarry contained up to 75 toxic substances, including heavy metals, Agent Orange and PCBs.In February 2011, Monsanto agreed to help with the costs of remediation, but did not accept responsibility for the pollution. In 2011, EAW and the Rhondda Cynon Taf council announced that they had decided to place an engineered cap over the waste mass, and stated that the cost would be \u00a31.5 million; previous estimates had been as high as \u00a3100 million.\n\n\n=== United States ===\n\n\n==== PCBs ====\nIn the late 1960s, the Monsanto plant in Sauget, Illinois, was the nation's largest producer of polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) compounds, which remained in the water along Dead Creek there. An EPA official referred to Sauget as \"one of the most polluted communities in the region\" and \"a soup of different chemicals\".In Anniston, Alabama, plaintiffs in a 2002 lawsuit provided documentation showing that the local Monsanto factory knowingly discharged both mercury and PCB-laden waste into local creeks for over 40 years. In 1969 Monsanto dumped 45 tons of PCBs into Snow Creek, a feeder for Choccolocco Creek, which supplies much of the area's drinking water, and buried millions of pounds of PCB in open-pit landfills located on hillsides above the plant and surrounding neighborhoods. In August 2003, Solutia and Monsanto agreed to pay plaintiffs $700 million to settle claims by over 20,000 Anniston residents.In June 2020, Bayer proposed paying $650 million to settle local PCB lawsuits, and $170 million to the attorneys-general of New Mexico, Washington and the District of Columbia. Monsanto was acknowledged at the time of the settlement to have ceased making PCBs in 1977, though State Impact of Pennsylvania reported that this did not stop PCBs from contaminating people many years later. State Impact of Pennsylvania stated \"In 1979, the EPA banned the use of PCBs, but they still exist in some products produced before 1979. They persist in the environment because they bind to sediments and soils. High exposure to PCBs can cause birth defects, developmental delays, and liver changes.\" On November 25, 2020, however U.S. District Judge Fernando M. Olguin rejected the proposed $650 million settlement from Bayer and allowed Monsanto-related lawsuits involving PCB to proceed.\n\n\n==== Polluted sites ====\nAs of November 2013, Monsanto was associated with nine \"active\" Superfund sites and 32 \"archived\" sites in the US, in the EPA's Superfund database. Monsanto was sued and settled multiple times for damaging the health of its employees or residents near its Superfund sites through pollution and poisoning.\n\n\n==== GM wheat ====\nIn 2013 a Monsanto-developed transgenic cultivar of glyphosate-resistant wheat was discovered on a farm in Oregon, growing as a weed or \"volunteer plant\". The final Oregon field test had occurred in 2001. As of May 2013, the GMO seed source was unknown. Volunteer wheat from a former test field two miles away was tested and was not found to be glyphosate-tolerant. Monsanto faced penalties up to $1 million over potential violations of the Plant Protection Act. The discovery threatened world-leading US wheat exports, which totaled $8.1 billion in 2012. This wheat variety was rarely exported to Europe and was more likely destined for Asia. Monsanto said it had destroyed all the material it held after completing trials in 2004 and it was \"mystified\" by its appearance. On June 14, 2013, the USDA announced: \"As of today, USDA has neither found nor been informed of anything that would indicate that this incident amounts to more than a single isolated incident in a single field on a single farm. All information collected so far shows no indication of the presence of GE wheat in commerce.\" As of August 30, 2013, while the source of the GM wheat remained unknown, Japan, South Korea and Taiwan had all resumed placing orders.\n\n\n==== Cancer risks of Roundup ====\nMonsanto has faced controversy in the United States over claims that its herbicide products might be carcinogens. There is limited evidence that human cancer risk might increase as a result of occupational exposure to large amounts of glyphosate, as in agricultural work, but no good evidence of such a risk from home use, such as in domestic gardening. The consensus among national pesticide regulatory agencies and scientific organizations is that labeled uses of glyphosate have demonstrated no evidence of human carcinogenicity. Organizations such as the World Health Organization (WHO), the Food and Agriculture Organization, European Commission, Canadian Pest Management Regulatory Agency, and the German Federal Institute for Risk Assessment have concluded that there is no evidence that glyphosate poses a carcinogenic or genotoxic risk to humans. However, one international scientific organization, the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), affiliated with the WHO, has made claims of carcinogenicity in research reviews; in 2015 the IARC declared glyphosate \"probably carcinogenic\".As of October 30, 2019, there were 42,700 plaintiffs who said that glyphosate herbicides caused their cancer after the IARC report in 2015 linking glyphosate to cancer in humans. Monsanto denies that Roundup is carcinogenic.In March 2017, 40 plaintiffs filed a lawsuit at the Alameda County Superior Court, a branch of the California Superior Court, asking for damages caused by the company's glyphosate-based weed-killers, including Roundup, and demanding a jury trial. On August 10, 2018, Monsanto lost the first decided case. Dewayne Johnson, who has non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, was initially awarded $289 million in damages after a jury in San Francisco said that Monsanto had failed to adequately warn consumers of cancer risks posed by the herbicide. Pending appeal, the award was later reduced to $78.5 million. In November 2018, Monsanto appealed the judgement, asking an appellate court to consider a motion for a new trial. A verdict on the appeal was delivered in June 2020 upholding the verdict but further reducing the award to $21.5 million.On March 27, 2019, Monsanto was found liable in a federal court for Edwin Hardeman's non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and ordered to pay $80 million in damages. A spokesperson for Bayer, by this time the parent company of Monsanto, said the company would appeal the verdict.On May 13, 2019, a jury in California ordered Bayer to pay $2 billion in damages after finding that the company had failed to adequately inform consumers of the possible carcinogenicity of Roundup. On July 26, 2019, an Alameda County judge cut the settlement to $86.7 million, stating that the judgement by the jury exceeded legal precedent.In June 2020, Monsanto acquisitor Bayer agreed to settle over a hundred thousand Roundup cancer lawsuits, agreeing to pay $8.8 to $9.6 billion to settle those claims, and $1.5 billion for any future claims. The settlement does not include three cases that have already gone to jury trials and are being appealed.\n\n\n==== Dicamba lawsuits ====\nFollowing a lawsuit by a peach farmer alleging that Dicamba used as a weed killer drifted in the wind from adjacent crops to destroy his peach orchards, a Missouri trial jury found in February 2020 that Monsanto and codefendant BASF were negligent in design of Dicamba and failed to warn farmers about the product, awarding $15 million for losses and $250 million in punitive damages. On February 14, 2020, the jury involved in a Missouri lawsuit involving tree damage caused by dicamba drift ruled against Bayer and its co-defendant BASF and found in favor of Bader Farms owner Bill Bader. In June 2020, Bayer agreed to a settlement of up to $400 million for all 2015-2020 crop year dicamba claims, not including the $250 million judgement which was issued to Bader. On November 25, 2020, U.S. District Judge Stephen Limbaugh Jr. reduced the punitive damage amount in the Bader Farms case to $60 million.\n\n\n=== Improper accounting for incentive rebates ===\nFrom 2009 to 2011, Monsanto improperly accounted for incentive rebates. The actions inflated Monsanto's reported profit by $31 million over the two years. Monsanto paid $80 million in penalties pursuant to a subsequent settlement with the US Securities and Exchange Commission. Monsanto materially misstated its consolidated earnings in response to losing market share of Roundup to generic producers. Monsanto overhauled its internal controls. Two of their top CPAs were suspended and Monsanto was required to hire, at their expense, an independent ethics/compliance consultant for two years.\n\n\n=== Alleged ghostwriting ===\nA review of glyphosate's carcinogenic potential by four independent expert panels, with a comparison to the IARC assessment, was published in September 2016. Using emails released in August 2017 by plaintiffs' lawyers who are suing Monsanto, Bloomberg Business Week reported that \"Monsanto scientists were heavily involved in organizing, reviewing, and editing drafts submitted by the outside experts.\" A Monsanto spokesperson responded that Monsanto had provided only non-substantive cosmetic copyediting.In 2017, The New York Times reported that a 2015 article attributed to researcher and columnist Henry I. Miller had been drafted by Monsanto. According to the report, Monsanto asked Miller to write an article rebutting the findings of the International Agency for Research on Cancer, and he indicated willingness to do it if he \"could start from a high-quality draft\". Forbes later removed Miller's blog from Forbes.com and ended their relationship.\n\n\n== Government relations ==\n\n\n=== United States ===\nMonsanto regularly lobbied the US government with expenses reaching $8.8 million in 2008  and $6.3 million in 2011. $2 million was spent on matters concerning \"Foreign Agriculture Biotechnology Laws, Regulations, and Trade\". Some US diplomats in Europe at other times worked directly for Monsanto.California's 2012 Proposition 37 would have mandated the disclosure of genetically modified crops used in the production of California food products. Monsanto spent $8.1 million opposing passage, making it the largest contributor against the initiative. The proposition was rejected by a 53.7% majority. Labeling is not required in the US.In 2009 Michael R. Taylor, food safety expert and former Monsanto VP for Public Policy, became a senior advisor to the FDA Commissioner.Monsanto is a member of the Washington D.C based Biotechnology Industry Organization (BIO), the world's largest biotechnology trade association, which provides \"advocacy, business development, and communications services.\" Between 2010 and 2011 BIO spent a total of $16.43 million on lobbying.The Monsanto Company Citizenship Fund aka Monsanto Citizenship Fund is a political action committee that donated over $10 million to various candidates from 2003 to 2013.As of October 2013, Monsanto and DuPont Co. continued backing an anti-labeling campaign, spending roughly $18 million. The state of Washington, along with 26 other states, made proposals in November to require GMO labeling.\n\n\n==== Revolving door ====\nIn the US regulatory environment, many individuals move back and forth between positions in the public and private sectors, including at Monsanto. Critics argued that the connections between the company and the government allowed Monsanto to obtain favorable regulations at the expense of consumer safety. Supporters of the practice point to the benefits of competent and experienced individuals in both sectors and to the importance of appropriately managing potential conflicts of interest.:\u200a16\u201323\u200a The list of such people includes:\n\nLinda J. Fisher\u2014EPA assistant administrator, then Monsanto VP from 1995 to 2000. then EPA deputy administrator.\nMichael A. Friedman, MD\u2014FDA deputy commissioner.\nEarle H. Harbison Jr., Central Intelligence Agency Deputy Director, then President, Chief Operating Officer, and Director, from 1986 to 1993.\nRobert Holifield\u2014chief of staff of Senate Agriculture Committee, then partner in Lincoln Policy Group.\nMickey Kantor\u2014US trade representative, then Monsanto board member.\nBlanche Lincoln\u2014US Senator and chair of Agriculture Committee, then founder of lobbying firm Lincoln Policy Group\nWilliam D. Ruckelshaus\u2014EPA Administrator, then acting Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and then Deputy Attorney General of the United States, then EPA administrator, then Monsanto Board member.\nDonald Rumsfeld\u2014Secretary of Defense and previous secretary of Searle, a Monsanto subsidiary, for eight years\nMichael R. Taylor\u2014assistant to the FDA commissioner, then attorney for King & Spalding, then FDA deputy commissioner for policy on food safety between 1991 and 1994. He was cleared of conflict of interest accusations. Then he became Monsanto's VP for Public Policy, becoming Senior Advisor to the FDA Commissioner for the Obama administration.\nClarence Thomas\u2014Supreme Court Justice who worked as an attorney for Monsanto in the 1970s, then wrote the majority opinion in J. E. M. Ag Supply, Inc. v. Pioneer Hi-Bred International, Inc. finding that \"newly developed plant breeds are patentable under the general utility patent laws of the United States.\"\nAnn Veneman\u2014Secretary of the Department of Agriculture, and member of the board of directors of Calgene\n\n\n=== United Kingdom ===\nDuring the late 1990s, Monsanto lobbied to raise permitted glyphosate levels in soybeans and was successful in convincing Codex Alimentarius and both the UK and US governments to lift levels 200 times to 20 milligrams per kilogram of soya.:\u200a265\u200a When asked how negotiations with Monsanto were conducted, Lord Donoughue, then the Labour Party Agriculture minister in the House of Lords, stated that all information relating to the matter would be \"kept secret\".:\u200a265\u200a During the 24 months prior to the 1997 British election Monsanto representatives had 22 meetings at the departments of Agriculture and the Environment.:\u200a266\u200a Stanley Greenberg, an election advisor to Tony Blair, later worked as a Monsanto consultant.:\u200a266\u200a Former Labour spokesperson David Hill, became Monsanto's media adviser at the lobbying firm Bell Pottinger.:\u200a266\u200a The Labour government was challenged in Parliament about \"trips, facilities, gifts and other offerings of financial value provided by Monsanto to civil servants\", but only acknowledged that Department of Trade and Industry had two working lunches with Monsanto.:\u200a267\u200a Peter Luff, then a Conservative Party MP and Chairman of the Agriculture Select Committee, received up to \u00a310,000 a year from Bell Pottinger on behalf of Monsanto.:\u200a266\u200a\n\n\n=== European Union ===\nIn January 2011, WikiLeaks documents suggested that US diplomats in Europe responded to a request for help from the Spanish government. One report stated, \"In addition, the cables show US diplomats working directly for GM companies such as Monsanto. 'In response to recent urgent requests by [Spanish rural affairs ministry] state secretary Josep Puxeu and Monsanto, post requests renewed US government support of Spain's science-based agricultural biotechnology position through high-level US government intervention.'\" The leaked documents showed that in 2009, when the Spanish government's policy approving MON810 was under pressure from EU interests, Monsanto's Director for Biotechnology for Spain and Portugal requested that the US government support Spain on the matter. The leaks indicated that Spain and the US had worked closely together to \"persuade the EU not to strengthen biotechnology laws\". Spain was viewed as a key GMO supporter and a leading indicator of support across the continent. The leaks also revealed that in response to an attempt by France to ban MON810 in late 2007, then-US ambassador to France, Craig Roberts Stapleton, asked Washington to \"calibrate a targeted retaliation list that [would cause] some pain across the EU\", targeting countries that did not support the use of GM crops. This activity transpired after the US, Australia, Argentina, Brazil, Canada, India, Mexico and New Zealand had brought an action against Europe via the World Trade Organization with respect to the EU's banning of GMOs; in 2006, the WTO had ruled against the EU.Monsanto was a member of EuropaBio, the leading biotechnology trade group in Europe. One of EuropaBio's initiatives is \"Transforming Europe's position on GM food\". It found \"an urgent need to reshape the terms of the debate about GM in Europe\". EuropaBio proposed the recruitment of high-profile \"ambassadors\" to lobby EU officials.In September 2017 Monsanto lobbyists were banned from the European parliament after the Monsanto refused to attend a parliamentary hearing into allegations of regulatory interference.\n\n\n=== Haiti ===\nAfter the 2010 Haiti earthquake, Monsanto donated $255,000 for disaster relief and 60,000 seed sacks (475 tons) of hybrid (non-GM) corn and vegetable seeds worth $4 million. However, a Catholic Relief Services (CRS) rapid assessment of seed supply and demand for the five most common food security crops found that the Haitians had enough seed and recommended that imported seeds be introduced only on a small scale. Emmanuel Prophete, head of Haiti's Ministry of Agriculture's Service National Semencier (SNS), stated that SNS was not opposed to the hybrid maize seeds because they at least double yields. Louise Sperling, Principal Researcher at the International Center for Tropical Agriculture (CIAT) told HGW that she was not opposed to hybrids, but noted that most hybrids required extra water and better soils and that most of Haiti was not appropriate for hybrids.\nActivists objected that some of the seeds were coated with the fungicides Maxim or thiram. In the United States, pesticides containing thiram are banned in home garden products because most home gardeners do not have adequate protection. Activists wrote that the coated seeds were handled in a dangerous manner by the recipients.The donated seeds were sold at a reduced price in local markets. However, farmers feared that they were being given seeds that would \"threaten local varieties\" and an estimated 8,000\u201312,000 farmers attended a protest of the donation on June 4, 2010, organized by a Haitian farmers' association, the Peasant Movement of Papay, where a small pile of seeds was symbolically burned.\n\n\n== Public relations ==\nMonsanto has engaged in various public relations campaigns to improve its image and public perception of some of its products. These include developing a relationship with scientist Richard Doll with respect to Agent Orange. Other campaigns include the joint funding with other biotech companies for the website GMO Answers.\n\n\n=== Sponsorships ===\nDisneyland attractions, namely:\nHall of Chemistry (1955 to 1966)\nMonsanto House of the Future (from 1957 to 1967)\nFashions and Fabrics through the Years (from 1965 to 1966)\nAdventure Thru Inner Space (from 1967 to 1986)\nMonsanto has donated $10 million to the Missouri Botanical Garden in St. Louis since the 1970s, which named its 1998 plant science facility the 'Monsanto Center'.\nField Museum\nGregor Mendel exhibit and \"Underground Adventures\" since 2011 \"about the importance and fragility of the ecosystem within soil\".\n\"Monsanto Environmental Education Initiative\", led by Gregory M. Mueller\nChair of the Department of Botany and Associate Curator of Mycology\nStaff of the Field Museum, such as Curator Mark W. Westneat, attended Monsanto meetings\nMonsanto Insectarium at the St. Louis Zoo, in St. Louis, Missouri\n\n\n== University relationships ==\nMonsanto was a major funder of science research at Washington University in St. Louis for many years. This research was highlighted by the Washington University/Monsanto Biomedical Research Agreement, which brought more than $100 million of research funding to the university. Washington University built the Monsanto Laboratory of the Life Sciences in 1965. In 2015, Monsanto gave Washington University's Institute for School Partnership a $1.94 million grant to help better teach students in STEM fields.\n\n\n== Awards ==\nIn 2009 Monsanto was chosen as Forbes magazine's company of the year. In 2010 Swiss research firm Covalence rated Monsanto least ethical of 581 multinational corporations based on their EthicalQuote reputation tracking index which \"aggregates thousands of positive and negative news items published by the media, companies, and stakeholders\". without attempt to validate sources. The journal Science ranked Monsanto in its Top 20 Employers list between 2011 and 2014. In 2012, it described the company as \"innovative leader in the industry\", \"makes changes needed\" and \"does important quality research\". Monsanto executive Robert Fraley won the World Food Prize for \"breakthrough achievements in founding, developing, and applying modern agricultural biotechnology\".\n\n\n== Documentaries ==\nBitter Seeds\nFood, Inc.\nThe Future of Food\nThe World According to Monsanto\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nBiological patents in the United States\nDuPont Pioneer\nGenetically modified food controversies\nIndustrial Bio-Test Laboratories\nMonsanto legal cases\nTemporal analysis of products\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nEhrlich, Walter (1997).

It is the holding company for Moody's Investors Service (MIS), an American credit rating agency, and Moody's Analytics (MA), an American provider of financial analysis software and services.\nMoody's was founded by John Moody in 1909 to produce manuals of statistics related to stocks and bonds and bond ratings. Moody's was acquired by Dun & Bradstreet in 1962. In 2000, Dun & Bradstreet spun off Moody's Corporation as a separate company that was listed on the NYSE under MCO. In 2007, Moody's Corporation was split into two operating divisions, Moody's Investors Service, the rating agency, and Moody's Analytics, with all of its other products. It was included in the Fortune 500 list for the first time in 2021.\n\n\n== History of Moody's ==\nMoody's Corporation traces its history back to two publishing companies established by John Moody, the inventor of modern bond credit ratings. It was first published in 1900 by John Moody, nine years before he founded Moody's Corporation. Initially called Moody's Manual of Industrial and Miscellaneous Securities, it was later superseded by Moody's Manual of Railroads and Corporation Securities, then by Moody's Analyses of Investments.In 1900, Moody published his first market assessment, called Moody's Manual of Industrial and Miscellaneous Securities, and established John Moody & Company. The publication provided detailed statistics relating to stocks and bonds of financial institutions, government agencies, manufacturing, mining, utilities, and food companies. It experienced early success, selling out its first print run in its first two months.\nBy 1903, Moody's Manual was a nationally recognized publication. The 1907 financial crisis fueled several changes in the markets, including the creation of the Federal Reserve System. Meanwhile, Moody was forced to sell his business, due to a shortage of capital. Moody returned in 1909 with a new publication focused solely on railroad bonds, Analysis of Railroad Investments, and a new company, Moody's Analyses Publishing Company.In 1962, Moody's Investors Service was bought by Dun & Bradstreet, a firm engaged in the related field of credit reporting, although they continued to operate largely as independent companies. By the late 1990s, Moody's superior performance compared to its parent company brought investor pressure to separate the businesses. In 1998, Dun & Bradstreet sold the Moody's publishing business to Financial Communications (later renamed Mergent). In December 1999, Dun & Bradstreet announced it would spin off Moody's Investors Service into a separate publicly traded company. The spin-off was completed on September 30, 2000.\n\n\n== Moody's Investors Service ==\n\nMoody's Investors Service is the bond credit rating business of Moody's Corporation, representing the company's traditional line of business and its historical name. Moody's Investors Service rates debt securities in several market segments related to public and commercial securities in the bond market. These include government, municipal and corporate bonds; managed investments such as money market funds, fixed-income funds and hedge funds; financial institutions including banks and non-bank finance companies; and asset classes in structured finance.Moody's Investors Service's closest competitors are Standard & Poor's (S&P) and Fitch Group. Together, they are sometimes referred to as the Big Three credit rating agencies. Moody's Investors Service and its close competitors play a key role in global capital markets as a supplementary credit analysis provider for banks and other financial institutions in assessing the credit risk of particular securities.According to Moody's, the purpose of its ratings is to \"provide investors with a simple system of gradation by which future relative creditworthiness of securities may be gauged\". To each of its ratings from Aaa through Caa, Moody's appends numerical modifiers 1, 2 and 3; the lower the number, the higher-end the rating. Aaa, Ca and C are not modified this way.\n\n\n== Moody's Analytics ==\n\nMoody's Analytics is a subsidiary of Moody's Corporation established in 2007 to focus on non-rating activities. It performs economic research related to credit analysis, performance management, financial modeling, structured analysis and financial risk management. Moody's Analytics also offers software and consulting services, including proprietary economic models and software tools, as well as professional training for the financial services sector, particularly risk management accreditation.\nMoody's Analytics started in 1995 as a business unit providing quantitative analysis services, including credit risk assessment software and services, called Moody's Risk Management Service (MRMS), and grew through partnerships and acquisitions in the late 1990s and 2000s, expanding its client base and capabilities. Acquisitions included KMV, Economy.com, Wall Street Analytics, Fermat International, Enb Consulting Ltd., The Institute of Risk Standards and Qualifications (iRSQ), CSI Global Education Inc., and Bureau van Dijk.\n\n\n== The Moody's Foundation ==\nIn 2002, Moody's Corporation created a corporate philanthropy program, The Moody's Foundation, focused on educational initiatives in mathematics, economics and finance. The organization offers grants to 501(c)(3) non-profits and equivalent international organizations, accredited schools and some governmental organizations.Since 2006, its main program is the annual Moody's Mega Math Challenge (M3 Challenge), a student academic challenge co-sponsored with the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics (SIAM), in which several hundred teams of high school students use quantitative analysis and modeling to solve problems related to real-life financial topics such as Social Security and the Economic Stimulus Act of 2008. Since 2010.\n\n\n== Moody's Research Labs ==\nMoody's Research Labs, Inc. was a business incubator focused on research and development specializing in financial risk modeling and analysis, focused on developing such products for use by other divisions of Moody's Corporation. Its president was Roger Stein. In March 2011 Moody's Analytics announced the release of a software program developed by Moody's Research Labs, the Mortgage Portfolio Analyzer, to assist portfolio managers in managing credit risk.\nMoody's Research Labs was dissolved in February 2012.\n\n\n== Lawsuit settlements ==\nOctober 2011: Moody\u2019s reached a settlement resolving claims by the state of Connecticut that the credit rating company unfairly gave lower ratings to public bonds.July 2012: Moody\u2019s said it reached a settlement with stockholders in lawsuits filed over structured finance ratings.April 2013: Moody's reached a settlement avoiding what would have been their first jury trial over crisis-era ratings. The fourteen plaintiffs, were led by Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank and King County, Washington. They claimed lawsuits filed in 2008 and 2009 that Moody's misled them by allegedly inflating ratings on two so-called structured investment vehicles they purchased.January 2017: Moody's Corporation, Moody's Analytics, and Moody's Investors Service reached an $863 million settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice and the attorneys general of 21 states and the District of Columbia \"Arising From Conduct in the Lead up to the Financial Crisis.\" \"The settlement resolves allegations arising from Moody\u2019s role in providing credit ratings for Residential Mortgage-Backed Securities (RMBS) and Collateralized Debt Obligations (CDO), contributing to the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression.\" Then California Attorney General Kamala Harris and then Missouri Attorney General Josh Hawley were among the 21 state signatories.March 2021: Moody's reached a settlement with the European Union regarding conflicts of interest.  Moody's was fined \u20ac3.7 million ($4.35 million).\n\n\n== Acquisitions ==\nIn 2019, Moody's Corporation purchased the majority share in the California-based climate risk data firm, Four Twenty Seven (427), that  \"measures the physical risks\" of \"climate change\". This acquisition is the \"latest indication that global warming can threaten the creditworthiness of governments and companies\" globally, according to a July 25, 2019 article in The New York Times. In 2021, Moody's acquired Risk Management Solutions (RMS) from Daily Mail and General Trust for $2 billion.  RMS generates risk models for the insurance and reinsurance industries. \n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Moody's at Wikimedia Commons\nOfficial website\nBusiness data for Moody's Corporation: \nMoody's Research Labs\nThe Moody's Foundation", "infobox": {"name": "Moody's Corporation", "logo": "[[File:Moody\u2019s logo.svg|frameless|upright=1.1|Logo]]", "image": "7 World Trade Center.jpg", "image_size": "250px", "image_caption": "Headquarters at [[7 World Trade Center]]", "type": "[[Public company|Public]]", "traded_as": "{{ubl|nyse|MCO|[[S&P 500|S&P 500 Component]]}} {{nyse|MCO}}", "predecessor": "John Moody & Company", "foundation": "{{Start date and age|1909}}", "founder": "[[John Moody (financial analyst)|John Moody]]", "location_city": "[[7 World Trade Center]]<br>[[New York City]]", "location_country": "[[United States]]", "area_served": "Worldwide", "key_people": "{{ubl|class|=|nowrap|[[Rob Fauber]]<br />(CEO)|[[Raymond W.

The company was present in over 100 countries, serviced through 15 marketing offices and representatives, and had tie-ups with other optical media storage manufacturers. Its products were manufactured at its three plants in New Delhi, which employed over 8,000 people. The company has subsidiaries that manufacture photovoltaic cells and modules using crystalline silicon and thin film technologies.\n\n\n== History ==\nMoser Baer India was founded in New Delhi in 1983 as a Time Recorder unit in technical collaboration with Maruzen Corporation (ja), Japan and Moser Baer Sumiswald (de), Switzerland. In 1988, it moved into the data storage industry, manufacturing 5.25-inch floppy diskettes. 1993, it started manufacturing 3.5-inch floppy diskettes (MFD).\nIn 1999, it set up a high-capacity plant to manufacture recordable Compact Disks (CD-Rs) and recordable Digital Versatile Disks (DVD-Rs). At the time, the company was the only large Indian manufacturer of magnetic and optical media data storage products, exporting around 85 percent of its production.\nIn 2006, the company expanded into the Photovoltaic cells and Home entertainment industries.\nIn 2016, NAND flash device controller supplier Phison Electronics is partnering with Moser Baer and Sahasra Electronics, India's two largest electronics manufacturers, to expand its business in India, according to Phison chairman Khein Seng Pua.The company was ordered liquidated due to its bankruptcy on 20 September 2018.A forensic audit of the company's finances found several irregularities in Moser Baer's accounts on 26 September 2018.The Central Bank of India declared Moser Baer's accounts as fraudulent on 20 April 2019.The Central Bank of India filed a first information report against Moser Baer on 16 August 2019.The Enforcement Directorate arrested Ratul Puri, a former executive director of Moser Baer and son of Deepak Puri, for a \u20b9354 crore bank fraud case on 20 August 2019. Ratul Puri, Deepak Puri, and several other directors have been charged with criminal conspiracy, cheating, forgery, and corruption.Seeing a void in the tangible digital storage market, Vinpower, Inc. (dba Vinpower Digital), assumed the role by acquiring the rights to Moser Baer and introducing a new line of digital storage products under the Moser Baer brand. These products are focused on optical discs and flash media, continuing the Moser Baer MID and mix of professional and consumer grade storage products.\n\n\n== Timeline ==\n1983-Year of

"url_name": "3144730", "txt": "Motorola Mobility LLC, marketed as Motorola, is an American consumer electronics and telecommunications company, and a subsidiary of Chinese multinational technology company Lenovo. Motorola primarily manufactures smartphones and other mobile devices running the Android operating system developed by Google.\nMotorola Mobility was formed on January 4, 2011, after a split of Motorola into two separate companies, with Motorola Mobility assuming the company's consumer-oriented product lines (including its mobile phone business, as well as its cable modems and pay television set-top boxes), while Motorola Solutions assumed the company's enterprise-oriented product lines.\nIn May 2012 Google acquired Motorola Mobility for US$12.5 billion; the main intent of the purchase was to gain Motorola's patent portfolio, in order to protect other Android vendors from litigation. Under Google, Motorola increased its focus on the entry-level smartphone market, and under the Google ATAP division, began development on Project Ara\u2014a platform for modular smartphones with interchangeable components. Shortly after the purchase, Google sold Motorola Mobility's cable modem and set-top box business to Arris Group.\nGoogle's ownership of the company was short lived. In January 2014, Google announced that it would sell Motorola Mobility to Lenovo for $2.91 billion. The sale, which excluded ATAP and all but 2,000 of Motorola's patents, was completed on October 30, 2014. Lenovo disclosed an intent to use Motorola Mobility as a way to expand into the United States smartphone market. In August 2015, Lenovo's existing smartphone division was subsumed by Motorola Mobility.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nOn January 4, 2011, Motorola Inc. was split into two publicly traded companies; Motorola Solutions took on the company's enterprise-oriented business units, while the remaining consumer division was taken on by Motorola Mobility. Motorola Mobility originally consisted of the mobile devices business, which produced smartphones, mobile accessories including Bluetooth headphones, and the home business, which produced set-top boxes, end-to-end video solutions, cordless phones, and cable modems.  Legally, the split was structured so that Motorola Inc. changed its name to Motorola Solutions and spun off Motorola Mobility as a new publicly traded company.\n\n\n=== 2012\u20132014: Under Google ownership ===\nOn August 15, 2011, American technology company Google announced that it would acquire Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion, pending regulatory approval. Critics viewed Google as being a white knight, since Motorola had recently had a fifth straight quarter of losses. Google planned to operate Motorola as an independent company. In a post on the company's blog, Google CEO and co-founder Larry Page revealed that Google's acquisition of Motorola Mobility was a strategic move to strengthen Google's patent portfolio. At the time, the company had 17,000 patents, with 7,500 patents pending. The expanded portfolio was to defend the viability of its Android operating system, which had been the subject of numerous patent infringement lawsuits between device vendors and other companies such as Apple, Microsoft and Oracle.\n\nOn November 17, 2011, Motorola announced that its shareholders voted in favor of the company's acquisition by Google for $12.5 billion. The deal received regulatory approval from the United States Department of Justice and the European Union on February 13, 2012. The deal received subsequent approval from Chinese authorities and was completed on May 22, 2012. Alongside the completion of the acquisition, Motorola Mobility's CEO Sanjay Jha was replaced by Dennis Woodside, a former Senior Vice President at Google.On August 13, 2012, Google announced that it would cut 4,000 employees and close one third of the company's locations, mostly outside the US.On December 19, 2012, it was announced that Arris Group would purchase Motorola Mobility's cable modem and set-top box business for $2.35 billion in a cash-and-stock transaction.In May 2013, Motorola opened a factory in Fort Worth, Texas, with the intent to assemble customized smartphones in the US. At its peak, the factory employed 3,800 workers. On April 9, 2014, following the departure of Woodside, lead product developer Rick Osterloh was named the new president of Motorola.Under Google ownership, Motorola's market share would be boosted by a focus on high-quality entry-level smartphones, aimed primarily at emerging markets; in the first quarter of 2014, Motorola sold 6.5 million phones\u2014led by strong sales of its low-end Moto G, especially in markets such as India, and in the United Kingdom\u2014where the company accounted for 6% of smartphone sales sold in the quarter, up from nearly zero. These goals were compounded further by the May 2014 introduction of the Moto E\u2014a low-end device aimed at first-time smartphone owners in emerging markets. In May 2014, Motorola announced that it would close its Fort Worth factory by the end of the year, citing the high costs of domestic manufacturing in combination with the weak sales of the Moto X (which was customized and assembled at the plant) and the company's increased emphasis on low-end devices and emerging markets.\n\n\n=== 2014\u2013present: Under Lenovo ownership ===\nOn January 29, 2014, Google announced it would, pending regulatory approval, sell Motorola Mobility to the Chinese technology company Lenovo for US$2.91 billion in a cash-and-stock deal, seeing the sale of $750 million in Lenovo shares to Google. Google retained the Advanced Technologies & Projects unit (which was integrated into the main Android team), and all but 2000 of the company's patents. Lenovo had prominently disclosed its intent to enter the U.S. smartphone market, and had previously expressed interest in acquiring BlackBerry, but was reportedly blocked by the Canadian government due to national security concerns. The acquisition was completed on October 30, 2014. The company remained headquartered in Chicago, and continued to use the Motorola brand, while Liu Jun (\u5218\u519b) \u2014 president of Lenovo's mobile device business, became the company's chairman.On January 26, 2015, owing to its new ownership, Motorola Mobility re-launched its product line in China with the local release of the second generation Moto X, and an upcoming release of the Moto G LTE and Moto X Pro (a re-branded Nexus 6) in time for the Chinese New Year.Lenovo maintained a \"hands-off\" approach in regards to Motorola's product development. Head designer Jim Wicks explained that \"Google had very little influence and Lenovo has been the same.\" The company continued to engage in practices it adopted under Google, such as the use of nearly \"stock\" Android, undercutting competitors' pricing while offering superior hardware (as further encouraged by Lenovo), and placing a larger focus on direct-to-consumer selling of unlocked phones in the US market (as opposed to carrier subsidized versions). On July 28, 2015, Motorola unveiled three new devices, and its first under Lenovo ownership\u2014the third-generation Moto G, Moto X Play, and Moto X Style\u2014in three separate events.\n\n\n==== Integration with Lenovo ====\nIn August 2015, Lenovo announced that it would merge its existing smartphone division, including design, development, and manufacturing, into the Motorola Mobility unit. The announcement came in addition to a cut of 3,200 jobs across the entire company. As a result of the change, Motorola Mobility will be responsible for the development and production of its own \"Moto\" product line, as well as Lenovo's own \"Vibe\" range.In January 2016, Lenovo announced that the \"Motorola\" name would be further downplayed in public usage in favor of the \"Moto\" brand. Motorola Mobility later clarified that the \"Motorola\" brand will continue to be used in product packaging and through its brand licensees. The company said that \"the Motorola legacy is near and dear to us as product designers, engineers and Motorola employees, and clearly it's important to many of you who have had long relationships with us. We plan to continue it under our parent company, Lenovo.\"In response to claims by a Lenovo executive that only high-end devices would be produced under the \"Moto\" name, with low-end devices being amalgamated into Lenovo's existing \"Vibe\" brand, Motorola Mobility clarified its plans and explained that it would continue to release low-end products under the Moto brand, including the popular Moto G and Moto E lines. Motorola stated that there would be overlap between the Vibe and Moto lines in some price points and territories, but that both brands would have different \"identities\" and experiences. Moto devices would be positioned as \"innovative\" and \"trendsetting\" products, and Vibe would be a \"mass-market challenger brand\".In November 2016, it was reported that Lenovo would be branding all its future smartphones under the brand \"Moto by Lenovo\". In March 2017, it was reported that Lenovo would continue to use the \"Motorola\" brand and logo, citing its recognition as a heritage cellphone brand. Furthermore, Motorola president Aymar de Lencquesaing stated that Lenovo planned to phase out its self-branded smartphones in favor of Motorola.Under Lenovo, Motorola has faced criticism for having an increasingly poor commitment to maintaining Android software updates for its devices, exemplified by negative responses to a 2019 announcement that  Android 9.0 \"Pie\" updates to the Moto Z2 Force in the United States would only be available to the Verizon Wireless model.\n\n\n== Products ==\n\n\n=== Razr ===\n\nMotorola Mobility's predecessor Motorola Inc released the Razr V3 in the third quarter of 2004. Because of its striking appearance and thin profile, it was initially marketed as an exclusive fashion phone, but within a year, its price was lowered and it was wildly successful, selling over 50 million units by July 2006. Over the Razr four-year run, Motorola sold more than 130 million units, becoming the bestselling clamshell phone in the world.\nMotorola released other phones based on the Razr design as part of the 4LTR line. These include the Pebl U6, Slvr L6, Slvr L7 (more expensive variant of Slvr L6), Razr V3c (CDMA), Razr V3i (with upgraded camera and appearance and iTunes syncing for 100 songs), V3x (supports 3G technology and has a 2-megapixel camera), Razr V3xx (supports 3.5G technology) and Razr maxx V6 (supports 3.5G technology and has a 2-megapixel camera) announced in July 2006.\nThe Razr series was marketed until July 2007, when the succeeding Motorola Razr2 series was released. Marketed as a more sleek and more stable design of the Razr, the Razr2 included more features, improved telephone audio quality, and a touch-sensitive external screen. The new models were the V8, the V9, and the V9m. However, Razr2 sales were only half of the original in the same period.Because Motorola relied so long upon the Razr and its derivatives and was slow to develop new products in the growing market for feature-rich touchscreen and 3G phones, the Razr appeal declined while rival offerings like the LG Chocolate, BlackBerry, and iPhone captured, leading Motorola to eventually drop behind Samsung and LG in market share for mobile phones. Motorola's strategy of grabbing market share by selling tens of millions of low-cost Razrs cut into margins and resulted in heavy losses in the cellular division.Motorola capitalized on the Razr too long and it was also slow adopting 3G. While Nokia managed to retain its lead of the worldwide cellular market, Motorola was surpassed first by Samsung and then LG Electronics. By 2007, without new cellphones that carriers wanted to offer, Motorola sold tens of millions of Razrs and their offshoots by slashing prices, causing margins to collapse in the process. CEO of Motorola Ed Zander departed for Dell, while his successor failed to turn around the struggling mobile handset division.Motorola continued to experience severe problems with its cellphone/handset division in the latter-2000s, recording a record $1.2 billion loss in Q4 2007. Its global competitiveness continued to decline: from 18.4% market share in 2007, to 9.7% by 2008. By 2010 Motorola's global market share had dropped to seventh place, leading to speculation of bankruptcy of the company. While Motorola's other businesses were thriving, the poor results from the Mobile Devices Unit as well as the 2008 financial crisis delayed the company plans to spinoff the mobile division.\n\n\n=== Early Android smartphones ===\n\n\n==== Droid ====\nIn 2008, Sanjay Jha took over as co-chief executive officer of Motorola's mobile device division; under Jha's control, significant changes were made to Motorola's mobile phone business, including most prominently, a shift to the recently introduced Android operating system as its sole smartphone platform, replacing both Symbian and Windows Mobile. In August 2009, Motorola introduced the Cliq, its first Android device, for T-Mobile USA. The device also featured a user interface known as Motoblur, which aimed to aggregate information from various sources, such as e-mail and social networking services, into a consistent interface.A month later, Motorola unveiled the Droid, Verizon Wireless's first Android phone, which was released on November 8, 2009. Backed with a marketing campaign by Verizon, which promoted the device as a direct competitor to the iPhone with the slogan \"iDon't,\" \"Droid Does,\" the Droid was a significant success for Motorola and Verizon. Flurry estimated that at least 250,000 Droid smartphones had been sold in its first week of availability. PC World considered the sales figures to be an indicator of mainstream growth for the Android platform as a whole. The Droid was also named \"Gadget of the Year\" for 2009 by Time. Other Droid-branded devices would be released by Verizon, although not all of them were manufactured by Motorola.In 2010, Motorola released the Droid X along with other devices such as the Charm, Flipout, and i1. In July 2010, Motorola reported that it had sold 2.7 million smartphones during the second quarter of 2010, an increase of 400,000 units over the first quarter. Jha stated that the company was in \"a strong position to continue improving our share in the rapidly growing smartphone market and improve our operating performance.\" In its third quarter earnings report, Jha reaffirmed that the Droid X was selling \"extremely well.\"\n\n\n==== Atrix 4G, Droid Bionic, XOOM, and Droid RAZR ====\nOn January 5, 2011, Motorola Mobility announced that the Atrix 4G and the Droid Bionic were headed to AT&T and Verizon, respectively, with expected release dates in Q1 of 2011. The Atrix was released on February 22 as the world's first phone with both a Dual-Core Processor and 1 GB of RAM. The phone also had optional peripherals such as a Multimedia Dock and a Laptop Dock which launched a Webtop UI. On February 24, two days after the release of Atrix, the company released Motorola Xoom, the world's first Android 3.0 tablet, and followed it up shortly afterwards with an update to make it the world's first Android 3.1 tablet.In the fourth quarter of 2011, Motorola unveiled the Droid RAZR, the world's thinnest 4G LTE smartphone at that time at just 7.1 mm. The Droid Razr featured Kevlar backing, the same used in bulletproof vests, and a Gorilla Glass faceplate. The phone was very successful through Verizon Wireless, and many color variants were released. In addition, a Maxx version of the Droid RAZR with an extended battery was released at CES 2012. The Droid RAZR MAXX won CTIA's \"Best Smartphone\" award. The company also announced new products by late 2011 and early 2012 such as the Xoom 2 tablets, the motoACTV fitness watch with Android, and the Droid 4 with 4G LTE for Verizon Wireless.\nThough Jha managed to restore some of the lost luster to Motorola Mobility, it struggled against Samsung and Apple. Even among Android manufacturers, Motorola had dropped behind Samsung, HTC, and LG in market share by the second quarter of 2011. This may have been due to the delay in releasing 4G LTE-capable devices, as well as setting the prices of its new products too high. Jha was replaced by Dennis Woodside as CEO by May 2012, when the Google acquisition was complete.\nMotorola released the Droid RAZR HD (and Droid RAZR MAXX HD) as its 2012 flagship devices, featuring improvements over 2011's RAZR. A lower end RAZR M was released, along with an Intel powered RAZR i. Through late 2012 until 2013's third quarter, no further devices were released, except for the lower end RAZR D1 and D3 devices for Latin America.\n\n\n=== Google era ===\n\n\n==== Moto X (2013-2015) ====\n\nIn an August 2013 interview, Motorola Corporate VP of product management Lior Ron explained that the company will focus on the production of fewer products to focus on quality rather than quantity. Ron stated, \"Our mandate from Google, from Larry, is really to innovate and take long-term bets. When you have that sort of mentality, it\u2019s about quality and not quantity\".\n\nSpeaking at the D11 conference in Palos Verdes, California, in May 2013, Motorola CEO Dennis Woodside announced that a new mobile device would be built by his company at a 500,000 square-feet facility near Fort Worth, Texas, formerly used by Nokia. The facility will employ 2,000 people by August 2013 and the new phone, to be named \"Moto X\", will be available to the public in October 2013. The Moto X featured Google Now software, and an array of sensors and two microprocessors that will mean that users can \u201cinteract with [the phone] in very different ways than you can with other devices\u201d. Media reports suggested that the phone will be able to activate functions preemptively based on an \"awareness\" of what the user is doing at any given moment.On July 3, 2013, Motorola released a full-page color advertisement in many prominent newspapers across the US. It claimed that Motorola's next flagship phone will be \"the first smartphone designed, engineered, and assembled in the United States\". On the same day that the advertisement was published, ABC News reported that customers will be able to choose the color of the phone, as well as add custom engravings and wallpaper at the time of purchase.In early July 2013, the Wall Street Journal reported that Motorola will spend nearly US$500 million on global advertising and marketing for the device. The amount is equivalent to half of Apple's total advertising budget for 2012.On August 1, 2013, Motorola Mobility unveiled the Moto X smartphone. It was released on August 23, 2013, in the US and Canada.On September 5, 2014, Motorola Mobility released the Moto X (2nd generation) smartphone. This continued the trend of the company letting consumers customize their devices through their Moto Maker website, and added new customization options like additional real wood choices and new leather options. The device also got many increases in specs. With a new 5.2 inch (13 cm) 1080p super AMOLED pentile display, a faster 2.5 GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon 801 processor, and an improved 13-megapixel rear camera capable of recording 4k resolution video with a dual LED flash. The device also came with new software features along with new infrared proximity sensors.\n\nThe Moto X Play and Moto X Style smartphones were announced in July 2015, and were released in September 2015.  Many customers who have ordered customized Moto X Pure Editions via Motorola's website have experienced delays receiving their devices.  These delays have been attributed to issues including manufacturing issues, lack of parts needed to complete assembly of custom phones (black fronts, Verizon SIM cards and 64 GB versions), a possible redesign due to initial phones having a defect that causes one of the front facing speakers to rattle at high volume and multiple day delays clearing US Customs at FedEx's Memphis, TN hub due to issues related to the import paperwork. .\nThe Moto X Force was launched on October 27, 2015. in the US, it was branded as the Droid Turbo 2, and was the flagship Motorola device of the year, offering Snapdragon 810 processor and 3 GB of memory. Like other Moto X devices, it was customizable through Moto Maker. This is the first Motorola smartphone that features Motorola's \"ShatterShield\" technology, which consists of two touchscreen elements, reinforced by an internal aluminum frame to make it resistant to bending and cracking, although this does not protect against scratches or other superficial screen damage. The top layer of the display is designed to be user-replaceable. The screen and case also have a water repellent nanocoating to protect the device from liquids that could damage internal components. This was also one of the last Motorola phones to be released under Google's ownership.\n\n\n==== Droid Mini, Ultra and Maxx ====\n\nDroid Mini, Droid Ultra and Droid Maxx were announced in a Verizon press conference on July 23, 2013. These phones share similar design with the predecessing Droid Razr HD lines in different screen and battery sizes, while all featuring the same Motorola X8 Mobile Computing System as the first-generation Moto X, with exclusive features like Motorola Active Notifications and 'OK Google' on device neural-based voice recognition system.\nIn September 2015, Droid Maxx 2 were launched as Verizon exclusives in the US market, which share the same overall design as the Moto X Style, with Verizon software on board. Unlike its Moto X counterpart, Droid Maxx 2 does not support Moto Maker for further customization. Instead, Moto Shell with 7 different colors was introduced specifically for the device.\n\n\n==== Moto G ====\n\nOn November 13, 2013, Motorola Mobility unveiled the Moto G (1st generation), a relatively low-cost smartphone. The Moto G has been launched in several markets, including the UK, United States, France, Germany, India and parts of Latin America and Asia. The Moto G is available in the United States, unlocked, for a starting price of US$179. The device is geared toward global markets and some US models support 4G LTE. Unlike the Moto X, the Moto G is not manufactured in the United States.\n\nOn September 5, 2014, Motorola Mobility released its successor to the 2013 version of the Moto G, called the Moto G (2nd generation). It came with a larger screen, higher resolution camera, along with dual front-facing stereo speakers.\nOn July 28, 2015, Motorola Mobility released the third generation of the Moto G series, called the Moto G (3rd generation), in a worldwide press conference in New Delhi, India. It retained the same screen as before but upgraded the processor and RAM. Furthermore, it has an IPx7 water-resistance certification and comes into two variants - 1GB RAM / 8GB ROM and 2GB RAM / 16GB ROM. The device also has the latest (at the time) Android Lollipop OS v5.1.1.\n\nIn May 2016, Motorola released three fourth generation Moto G smartphones: Moto G\u2074, Moto G\u2074 Plus, and Moto G\u2074 Play.\nOn February 26, 2017, Motorola Mobility released two fifth generation Moto G smartphones during Mobile World Congress: Moto G5 and Moto G5 Plus.On August 1, 2017, Motorola added two 'special edition' models to the Moto G lineup, the Moto G5S and Moto G5S Plus.In May 2018, Motorola released the sixth generation of the Moto G line up in three variants, the G6, G6 Plus and the G6 Play. The G6 and G6 Plus have two rear cameras, capable of taking 4k video (Plus model only), and a larger screen with an aspect ratio of 18:9. The specification ranges from 3/32GB to 6/128GB.\n\nIn February 2019, Motorola launched the Moto G7 with 3 extra variants, (The Moto G7 Play, Moto G7 Power and the Moto G7 Plus). It has a 6.2 Inch screen, 0.5 inches bigger than The 5.7 inch screen of its predecessor, the Moto G6. The G7 also has two rear cameras, the same as its predecessor. It's said to have a brighter and clearer display than the G6, but with most of the same features. The G7 also has a heavily upgraded mid-range Snapdragon 632 processor compared with the G6 which has a budget Snapdragon 450 Processor. Additionally, the Moto G7 features a hefty 4GB of RAM packed into the budget-friendly device. This is a 1GB upgrade from the G6 which featured 3GB of RAM . Since its Market entry in 2013, the Moto G Series has continued to provide powerful mid-range smartphones for a budget-friendly price.\n\n\n==== Moto E ====\n\nThe Moto E (1st generation) was announced and launched on May 13, 2014. It was an entry-level device intended to compete against feature phones by providing a durable, low-cost device for first-time smartphone owners or budget-minded consumers, with a particular emphasis on emerging markets. The Moto E shipped with a stock version of Android \"4.4 \"KitKat\".\"\nThe Moto E (2nd generation) was announced and launched on March 10, 2015, in India. Released in the wake of its successful first generation, the second generation of the Moto E series still aims to provide a smooth experience to budget-oriented consumers. It increased the screen size to 4.5\" but kept the resolution at 540 x 960px. It came in two versions, a 3G-only one powered by a Snapdragon 200 chipset and a 4G LTE version powered by a Snapdragon 410 chipset. As before, it shipped with a stock version of the latest (at the time) Android 5.0 \"Lollipop\".\nIn 2015 Motorola Mobility marketed the 2nd generation Moto E with the promise of continual updates and support, \"And while other smartphones in this category don't always support upgrades, we won't forget about you, and we'll make sure your Moto E stays up to date after you buy it.\" However, 219 days after launch Motorola announced that the device would not receive an upgrade from Lollipop to 6.0 \"Marshmallow\". It was later announced that the LTE variant of the device would receive an upgrade to Marshmallow in Canada, Europe, Latin America, and Asia (excluding China). China and the US carrier-branded versions of the device remained on Lollipop, with a minor upgrade to version 5.1. However, the 2nd generation Moto E in the USA did continue to receive support via Android Security Patch updates until at least the October 1, 2016 patch for the LTE variant and the November 1, 2016 patch for the non-LTE variant.\n\n\n==== Google Nexus 6 / Moto X Pro ====\n\nThe Nexus 6 was announced October 15, 2014 by Motorola Mobility in partnership with Google. It was the first 6-inch smartphone in the mainstream market, and came with many high-end specs. It was the successor to the Nexus 5, Google's previous flagship phone from their Google Nexus series of devices. Its design was similar to the Moto X (2nd generation) but with a larger display and dual, front-facing speakers rather than the single front-facing speaker on the Moto X.

Veal or pork cordon bleu is made of veal or pork pounded thin and wrapped around a slice of ham and a slice of cheese, breaded, and then pan fried or baked. For chicken cordon bleu chicken breast is used instead of veal. Ham cordon bleu is ham stuffed with mushrooms and cheese.\n\n\n== Name ==\nThe French term cordon bleu is translated as \"blue ribbon\". According to Larousse Gastronomique cordon bleu \"was originally a wide blue ribbon worn by members of the highest order of knighthood, L'Ordre des chevaliers du Saint-Esprit, instituted by Henri III of France in 1578. By extension, the term has since been applied to food preparation to a very high standard and by outstanding cooks. The analogy no doubt arose from the similarity between the sash worn by the knights and the ribbons (generally blue) of a cook's apron.\"\n\n\n== History ==\nThe origins of cordon bleu as a schnitzel filled with cheese are in Brig, Switzerland, probably about the 1940s, first mentioned in a cookbook from 1949. The earliest reference to \"chicken cordon bleu\" in The New York Times is dated to 1967, while similar veal recipes are found from at least 1955.\n\n\n== Variants ==\n\nThere are many variations of the recipe involving cutlet, cheese, and meat. A popular way to prepare chicken cordon bleu is to butterfly cut a chicken breast, place a thin slice of ham inside, along with a thin slice of a soft, easily melted cheese. The chicken breast is then rolled into a roulade, coated in bread crumbs, and then deep-fried. Other variations exist with the chicken baked rather than fried.\nOther common variations include omitting the bread crumbs, wrapping the ham around the chicken, or using bacon in place of ham.A variant popular in the Asturias province of Spain is cachopo, a deep-fried cutlet of veal, beef or chicken wrapped around a filling of Serrano ham and cheese. In Spain, the version made with chicken is often called san jacobo.\nA common variant in Uruguay and Argentina is the Milanesa Rellena. It consists of two beef or chicken fillets passed through beaten egg, later, stuffed with cooked ham and mozzarella cheese and superimposed like a sandwich. Once this is done, they are again passed through beaten eggs and breadcrumbs, to be fried or baked. It is usually served with papas fritas (French fries) as a garnish.\nIn largely Muslim-populated countries, the halal versions of chicken cordon bleu are also popular, such that the chicken is rolled around beef or mutton instead of pork product.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n\n== References ==", "infobox": {"name": "Cordon bleu", "image": "Cordon-bleu-2.jpg", "image_size": "250px", "caption": "A schnitzel cordon bleu, as served in Switzerland", "country": "[[Swiss cuisine|Switzerland]]", "main ingredient": "[[Veal]] or [[Chicken (food)|chicken]] breast, [[cheese]], [[ham]], [[bread crumbs]]"}, "wikidata": {"Commons category (P373)": "Cordon bleu", "Freebase ID (P646)": "/m/0gj9rzv", "has part or parts (P527)": ["veal (Q957434)", "cheese (Q10943)"], "image (P18)": "Cordon-bleu-2.jpg", "country of origin (P495)": "Switzerland (Q39)", "subclass of (P279)": "veal dish (Q28100665)", "TasteAtlas ID (P5456)": "cordon-bleu", "part of (P361)": "Swiss cuisine (Q13497)", "Marmiton ID (P9769)": "cordon-bleu"}, "cat": "Foods", "url": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cordon_bleu_(dish)"}, {"name": "Fruit curd", "url_name": "3741471", "txt": "Fruit curd is a dessert spread and topping usually made with citrus fruit, such as lemon, lime, orange, grapefruit or tangerine. Other flavor variations include passion fruit, mango, and berries such as raspberries, cranberries or blackberries. The basic ingredients are beaten egg yolks, sugar, fruit juice, and zest, which are gently cooked together until thick and then allowed to cool, forming a soft, smooth, flavorful spread. The egg yolks are usually tempered in the cooking process to prevent their coagulation. Some recipes also include egg whites or butter.In late 19th- and early 20th-century England, homemade lemon curd was traditionally served with bread or scones at afternoon tea as an alternative to jam, and as a filling for cakes, small pastries, and tarts. Homemade lemon curd was usually made in relatively small amounts as it did not keep as well as jam. In more modern times, larger quantities became possible because of the use of refrigeration. Commercially manufactured curds often contain additional preservatives and thickening agents.Contemporary commercially made curds remain a popular spread for bread, scones, toast, waffles, crumpets, pancakes, cheesecake, or muffins. They can also be used as a flavoring for desserts or yoghurt. Lemon-meringue pie, made with lemon curd and topped with meringue, has been a popular dessert in Britain, Canada, Australia and the United States since the nineteenth century. Lemon curd can also have whipped cream folded into it for such uses as filling cream puffs.Curds differ from pie fillings or custards in that they contain a higher proportion of juice and zest, which gives them a bolder, fruitier taste. Also, curds containing butter have a smoother and creamier texture than both pie fillings and custards, which contain little or no butter and use cornstarch or flour for thickening. Additionally, unlike custards, curds are not usually eaten on their own.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nList of dessert sauces\nList of lemon dishes and drinks\nList of spreads\n\n\n== References ==", "infobox": {"name": "Fruit curd", "image": "Lemoncurd.jpg", "caption": "Homemade lemon curd", "country": "England", "course": "[[Dessert]]", "type": "[[Spread (food)|Spread]]", "main_ingredient": "Egg [[yolk]]s, [[sugar]], fruit juice and [[Zest (ingredient)|zest]] ([[lemon]]s, [[Lime (fruit)|limes]], [[Orange (fruit)|oranges]], or [[raspberry|raspberries]])"}, "wikidata": {"Freebase ID (P646)": "/m/09yh8g", "subclass of (P279)": ["spread (Q1472481)", "dessert sauce (Q25327021)", "fruit preserves (Q74048276)"], "image (P18)": "Lemoncurd.jpg", "has part or parts (P527)": ["egg yolk (Q181409)", "sugar (Q11002)"], "country of origin (P495)": "England (Q21)", "BabelNet ID (P2581)": "00050633n", "Commons category (P373)": "Fruit curds"}, "cat": "Foods", "url": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fruit_curd"}, {"name": "Zarangollo", "url_name": "3730506", "txt": "Zarangollo is a common dish in the Murcian countryside in Spain.

It is a typical food of Salvador, Bahia and it is also common to the North and Northeast regions of Brazil. In the northeastern state of Bahia it is commonly eaten with acaraj\u00e9, and as a ritual offering in Candombl\u00e9, with aca\u00e7\u00e1 or acaraj\u00e9. Vatap\u00e1 is often eaten with white rice in other regions of Brazil. The shrimp can be replaced with ground tuna, chicken or cod among other options.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\n\"Vatap\u00e1\" is probably derived from the term Yoruba vata'pa. In Hausa, as well as Yoruba, the collocantion wa ta ba can be found, which means in both languages for her.\n\n\n== Origin ==\nVatap\u00e1 is of African origin, and arrived in Brazil through the Yoruba people with the name of  ehba-t\u00e1pa.\nIt is a typical dish of the northeastern cuisine and very traditional in the state of Bahia, where palm oil is an ingredient and the dish is frequently served with caruru. It is also popular in Amazonas, in Amap\u00e1 and Par\u00e1, where the recipe suffers variations such as the absence of peanuts and other common ingredients in the traditional version. Vatap\u00e1 shows the influence of African cuisine brought by the Africans enslaved in slave ships starting in the 16th century.

When completed in 2000, it was the largest wooden ship to be built in the UK for over 100 years.\nThe ship was built by the Jubilee Sailing Trust (JST) and, along with the STS Lord Nelson, the pair are the only tall ships in the world that were built so that both disabled and non-disabled people can sail as crew, not passengers. Features that cannot be found on other ships include wheelchair lifts throughout, unique ascender systems that allow wheelchair users to go aloft (either assisted or by their own efforts), a speaking compass for those with visual impairments, hearing loops, adjustable furniture for those with mobility difficulties, and a joystick to help individuals with dexterity limitations to steer the ship. Everyone plays a full and active role in the voyage. The JST are a UN accredited charity offering sailing adventures to people of all abilities and backgrounds.\n\n\n== History ==\nLaunched in 2000, Sailing Vessel Tenacious is the largest wooden tall ship built in the United Kingdom in the last 100 years. It is 65 metres (213.25 feet) long including bowsprit, and it is rigged as a (three-masted) barque with two mizzen gaffs. Its deck is 49.85 metres long, its hull is 54.02 metres long, and it has a beam of 10.6 metres at its widest point. A press release from the Belfast Maritime Festival on 22 June 2006 announced that the Tenacious was \"the largest wooden ship still afloat\".Tenacious displaces about 714 tons (summer draft). Its maiden voyage was on 1 September 2000 from Southampton to Southampton calling at Sark, St Helier and Weymouth. The ship is owned by a UK-based charity, the Jubilee Sailing Trust, which also owns the 42-metre-long tall ship STS Lord Nelson (length including bowsprit is 55 metres and waterline length is 37 metres).Tenacious featured in the first series of Channel 5's Sea Patrol UK, when one of the crew members had fallen ill and needed to be winched into an RAF Westland Sea King and taken to hospital. Due to the height of the masts and rigging, this posed a challenge to the helicopter's pilot and winch crew but the rescue attempt was successful and the crew member survived a potentially fatal condition.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website", "infobox": {"Ship image": "Sv tenacious.jpg", "Ship caption": "SV ''Tenacious'' at the starting line for the last leg of the STI Historical Seas Festival 2010 from Istanbul to Lavrion."}, "wikidata": {"instance of (P31)": "ship (Q11446)", "Freebase ID (P646)": "/m/028520k", "image (P18)": "Sv tenacious.jpg", "has use (P366)": "training ship (Q660668)", "home port (P504)": "Southampton (Q79848)", "Quora topic ID (P3417)": "Tenacious", "IMO ship number (P458)": "1005679", "MMSI (P587)": "235000230", "draft (P2262)": {"amount": "+4.26", "unit": "http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q11573"}, "length (P2043)": {"amount": "+65.0", "unit": "http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q11573"}, "call sign (P2317)": "ZQHM2", "gross tonnage (P1093)": {"amount": "+586", "unit": "1"}, "beam (P2261)": {"amount": "+16.34", "unit": "http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q11573"}, "category for ship name (P7782)": "Category:Tenacious (ship, 2000) (Q81654743)", "service entry (P729)": "+2000-00-00T00:00:00Z", "country of registry (P8047)": "United Kingdom (Q145)", "port of registry (P532)": "Southampton (Q79848)"}, "cat": "Transport", "url": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SV_Tenacious"}, {"name": "(GCSM, ICS)", "url_name": "50063387", "txt": "The Ganz CSMG (Hungarian: [\u02c8\u0261\u0252nz \u02c8t\u0361\u0283e\u02d0\u025bm\u0261e\u02d0]), known in official FVV/BKV records as GCSM, or sometimes known as ICS, is a series of tramcars which was manufactured by Hungarian companies Ganz-M\u00c1VAG Mozdony-, Vagon- \u00e9s G\u00e9pgy\u00e1r (\"Ganz-M\u00c1VAG Locomotive, Carriage and Machine Factory\") and Ganz Villamoss\u00e1gi Gy\u00e1r (\"Ganz Electric Factory\"). The CSMG tramcars have three main variants, which are all eight axle rail motor coaches with a Bo'2'2'Bo'tr axle arrangement, the last variant being capable of operating as electric multiple units. The cars were manufactured in Budapest between 1964 and 1978, and in overall 152 regular units and two prototypes were made.\nThe official CSMG designation resolves to Csukl\u00f3s Motorkocsi, Ganz (\"Articulated Motor Coach, Ganz\"), this was changed to GCSM in FVV and BKV records, and the semi-official ICS resolves to Ipari Csukl\u00f3s (\"Industrial Articulated\"), because it was the first articulated tram design in Hungary which was produced by a regular manufacturing company instead of an in-house workshop of a transit company. The final production variant of the series is capable of controlling another unit of its type through proprietary 50-wire cables, though traction current isn't shared between units. The trams are also capable of sensing the breakup of the tramset with a proprietary system implemented along the couplers. Two prototypes, sometimes referred to as CSMG-0, were made before mass production started, these cars originally had a single articulated joint instead of two, but later these were extended. The production variants CSMG-1, CSMG-2 and CSMG-3 were unified over the years and now they are referred to as CSMG-E. One damaged car was rebuilt with experimental features, and its type is referred to as KCSV-5. Partly based on the operating experiences of this car, in the 1990s 20 CSMG cars were refurbished, their type is referred to as KCSV-7. The CSMG was intended to replace the lower capacity Ganz UV and obsolete, in-house FVV CSM Beng\u00e1li trams.\nCSMG tramcars are still in active service in Budapest, whereas \u2013 with the exception of the two prototypes \u2013 the first scrapping took place only in 2009, when the only KCSV-5 car was taken out of service owing to maintenance difficulties. The first tramcar entered passenger service in 1965, thus the series is now in continuous service for 56\u201357 years. The series also carries the distinction of having one of the cars take Diana, Princess of Wales on a ride along the city's scenic Line 2 on the Danube's bank. CSMG tramcars are nicknamed as ICS or ipari csukl\u00f3s (\"industrial articulated\"), Ganz csukl\u00f3s (\"Ganz articulated\"), or when running in multiple unit pairs, G\u00f3li\u00e1t (\"Goliath\").\n\n\n== Design and manufacturing ==\nThe CSMG series was Ganz's, and thus the Hungarian machine industry's first foray into articulated rail vehicle production as the obsolete CSM Beng\u00e1li tramcars made by FVV's in-house \u00c1rp\u00e1d F\u00fczesi Workshop, and Ganz's own lower capacity UV series proved to be inadequate for the growing demands of Budapest's tram network. Thus two CSMG prototypes, sometimes referred to as CSMG-0, were manufactured between 1964 and 1965. These had only one articulation, but were expanded with another body section later to resemble the production variants, as they were in passenger service for some years. After the first CSMG production run however, features were scaled back, this resulted in tramcars having less comfort, but after years of repairs and refurbishments, almost all CSMG cars converged to a general set of specifications referred to as CSMG-E (Csukl\u00f3s Motorkocsi, Ganz \u2013 Egys\u00e9ges\u00edtett, \"Articulated Motor Coach, Ganz \u2013 Unified\").\nEventually 3 main variants of CSMG tramcars were produced, these variants are shown in the following table.\n\nBetween 1991 and 1994, a CSMG car damaged in the 1980s was rebuilt and modernized by Ganz and got the designation KCSV-5 (Korszer\u0171s\u00edtett Csukl\u00f3s Villamos, 5-\u00f6s t\u00edpus, \"Modernized Articulated Tram, type 5\"). Based on the experiences with this car, 30 CSMG cars were refurbished between 1996 and 1999, these were designated as KCSV-7 (Korszer\u0171s\u00edtett Csukl\u00f3s Villamos, 7-es t\u00edpus, \"Modernized Articulated Tram, type 7\"). These shouldn't be confused with Ganz's last articulated tram type, the similarly designated KCSV-6.\nCSMG-related prototypes, refurbishments and other related vehicles are shown in the following table.\n\n\n== See also ==\nFVV CSM\nGanz UV\nGanz KCSV-6\nGanz MFAV\nTrams in Budapest\nGanz Works\nArticulated vehicle\n\n\n== References and notes ==", "infobox": {"background": "#F5C71A", "name": "Ganz CSMG<br />(GCSM, ICS)", "image": "14-05-06-Tram-Budapest-Keleti-p\u00e1lyaudvar-RalfR.jpg", "caption": "CSMG-2 motor coach no. 1410 on<br />Budapest's line 24 in 2014", "interiorimage": "Ipari csukl\u00f3s villamos, utast\u00e9r.jpg", "interiorcaption": "Interior of a CSMG motor coach in 2011", "service": "1965\u2013present<br />( {{Age in years|1965}} years)", "manufacturer": "''underframe, bogies and carbody:''<br />[[Ganz Works|Ganz-M\u00c1VAG Mozdony-, Vagon- \u00e9s G\u00e9pgy\u00e1r]]<br />[[Budapest]],&nbsp; {{flag|Hungary}} <br />''traction system:''<br />[[Ganz Works|Ganz Villamoss\u00e1gi Gy\u00e1r]]<br />[[Budapest]],&nbsp; {{flag|Hungary}}", "replaced": "[[FVV CSM]] ''Beng\u00e1li'', [[Ganz UV]]", "yearconstruction": "''CSMG-0:''<br />1964\u20131965<br />''CSMG-1:''<br />1967\u20131970<br />''CSMG-2:''<br />1970\u20131976<br />''CSMG-3:''<br />1977\u20131978", "yearservice": "1965<br />( {{Years or months ago|1965}} )", "refurbishment": "1970\u20131975,<br />1991\u20131994<br />''(1 CSMG into KCSV-5)'',<br />1996\u20131999<br />''(20 CSMG into KCSV-7)''", "yearscrapped": "2009", "numberbuilt": "''CSMG-0:'' 2<br />''CSMG-1:'' 35<br />''CSMG-2:'' 87<br />''CSMG-3:'' 30<br />''total:'' 154", "numberpreserved": "at least 1<br />(KCSV-5)", "numberscrapped": "at least 2<br />(CSMG prototypes)", "formation": "MC, {{efn|name|=|MC|MC stands for [[Motor coach (rail)|motor coach]]}} MC+MC", "fleetnumbers": "''CSMG-0:''<br />3730, 3731<br />''CSMG-1:''<br />1301\u20131335<br />''CSMG-2:''<br />1336\u20131390, 1420\u20131451<br />''(1371\u20131390\u21921400\u20131419)''<br />''CSMG-3:''<br />1452\u20131481", "capacity": "''CSMG cars:''<br />201 passengers, {{efn|name|=|5ppm|assuming 5 passengers/m\u00b2}} <br />30 seats<br />''(13xx cars)''<br />196 passengers,<br />38 seats<br />''(14xx cars)''<br />''KCSV-5:''<br />201 passengers,<br />30 seats<br />''KCSV-7:''<br />192 passengers,<br />36 seats", "operator": "F\u0151v\u00e1rosi Villamosvas\u00fat (FVV),<br />Budapest,&nbsp; {{flag|Hungary}} <br />''(1965\u20131967)''<br />[[BKV Zrt.|Budapesti K\u00f6zleked\u00e9si V\u00e1llalat]] (BKV),<br />Budapest,&nbsp; {{flag|Hungary}} <br />''(1968\u2013present)''", "carbody": "[[Steel]]", "carlength": "''carbody:''<br /> {{convert|26000|mm|ftin|abbr|=|on}} <br />''between couplers:''<br /> {{convert|26900|mm|ftin|abbr|=|on}}", "width": "{{convert|2300|mm|ftin|abbr|=|on}}", "height": "''CSMG cars:''<br /> {{convert|3100|mm|ftin|abbr|=|on}} <br />''KCSV cars:''<br /> {{convert|3500|mm|ftin|abbr|=|on}}", "floorheight": "{{convert|850|mm|ftin|abbr|=|on}}", "entrylevelorstep": "step", "art-sections": "two<br />''CSMG-0 prototypes until 1974:''<br />one", "wheeldiameter": "{{convert|670|mm|ftin|abbr|=|on}}", "wheelbase": "{{convert|1800|mm|ftin|abbr|=|on}}", "doors": "folding doors,<br />5 per side,<br />2+2+2+2+2<br />''CSMG-0 prototypes until 1974:''<br />folding doors,<br />4 per side,<br />2+2+2+2", "maxspeed": "{{convert|50|kph|mph|abbr|=|on}}", "weight": "''CSMG cars:''<br /> {{convert|33600|kg|ST|abbr|=|on}} <br />''KCSV cars:''<br /> {{convert|34000|kg|ST|abbr|=|on}}", "traction": "4&nbsp;\u00d7 [[Ganz Works|Ganz]]&nbsp;TK&nbsp;44", "poweroutput": "''CSMG cars:''<br />4&nbsp;\u00d7 {{convert|66|hp-electrical|kW|abbr|=|on}} <br />(= {{convert|264|hp-electrical|kW|abbr|=|on}} )<br />''KCSV cars:''<br />4&nbsp;\u00d7 {{convert|61|hp-electrical|kW|abbr|=|on}} <br />(= {{convert|244|hp-electrical|kW|abbr|=|on}} )", "aux": "24&nbsp;V&nbsp;DC", "powersupply": "24&nbsp;V&nbsp;DC", "hvac": "electric heating<br />''(originally only on CSMG-1)''", "electricsystem": "600&nbsp;V&nbsp;DC from [[overhead line]]", "collectionmethod": "[[Pantograph (transport)|pantograph]]", "uicclass": "Bo'2'2'Bo'tr {{efn|name|=|UICtr|the UIC axle arrangement classification appendix \"tr\" officially denotes a tram vehicle}} <br />''CSMG-0 prototypes until 1974:''<br />Bo'2'Bo'tr", "bogies": "pivoting", "brakes": "electric", "safety": "proprietary tramset breakage sensing system", "coupling": "''mechanical:''<br />[[Alemann coupler|Alemann-type]] [[Cone coupler|trichterkupplung]]<br />''electrical:''<br />proprietary DC connectors", "multipleworking": "only with same type", "light": "[[incandescent light bulb]]s", "gauge": "{{RailGauge|sg}}"}, "wikidata": {"Commons category (P373)": "Ganz CSMG in Budapest", "instance of (P31)": "tram model (Q76154857)", "manufacturer (P176)": "Ganz Works (Q369524)", "operator (P137)": "Budapesti K\u00f6zleked\u00e9si Zrt.

These shouldn't be confused with Ganz's last articulated tram type, the similarly designated KCSV-6.\nCSMG-related prototypes, refurbishments and other related vehicles are shown in the following table.\n\n\n== See also ==\nFVV CSM\nGanz UV\nGanz KCSV-6\nGanz MFAV\nTrams in Budapest\nGanz Works\nArticulated vehicle\n\n\n== References and notes ==", "infobox": {"background": "#F5C71A", "name": "Ganz CSMG<br />(GCSM, ICS)", "image": "14-05-06-Tram-Budapest-Keleti-p\u00e1lyaudvar-RalfR.jpg", "caption": "CSMG-2 motor coach no. 1410 on<br />Budapest's line 24 in 2014", "interiorimage": "Ipari csukl\u00f3s villamos, utast\u00e9r.jpg", "interiorcaption": "Interior of a CSMG motor coach in 2011", "service": "1965\u2013present<br />( {{Age in years|1965}} years)", "manufacturer": "''underframe, bogies and carbody:''<br />[[Ganz Works|Ganz-M\u00c1VAG Mozdony-, Vagon- \u00e9s G\u00e9pgy\u00e1r]]<br />[[Budapest]],&nbsp; {{flag|Hungary}} <br />''traction system:''<br />[[Ganz Works|Ganz Villamoss\u00e1gi Gy\u00e1r]]<br />[[Budapest]],&nbsp; {{flag|Hungary}}", "replaced": "[[FVV CSM]] ''Beng\u00e1li'', [[Ganz UV]]", "yearconstruction": "''CSMG-0:''<br />1964\u20131965<br />''CSMG-1:''<br />1967\u20131970<br />''CSMG-2:''<br />1970\u20131976<br />''CSMG-3:''<br />1977\u20131978", "yearservice": "1965<br />( {{Years or months ago|1965}} )", "refurbishment": "1970\u20131975,<br />1991\u20131994<br />''(1 CSMG into KCSV-5)'',<br />1996\u20131999<br />''(20 CSMG into KCSV-7)''", "yearscrapped": "2009", "numberbuilt": "''CSMG-0:'' 2<br />''CSMG-1:'' 35<br />''CSMG-2:'' 87<br />''CSMG-3:'' 30<br />''total:'' 154", "numberpreserved": "at least 1<br />(KCSV-5)", "numberscrapped": "at least 2<br />(CSMG prototypes)", "formation": "MC, {{efn|name|=|MC|MC stands for [[Motor coach (rail)|motor coach]]}} MC+MC", "fleetnumbers": "''CSMG-0:''<br />3730, 3731<br />''CSMG-1:''<br />1301\u20131335<br />''CSMG-2:''<br />1336\u20131390, 1420\u20131451<br />''(1371\u20131390\u21921400\u20131419)''<br />''CSMG-3:''<br />1452\u20131481", "capacity": "''CSMG cars:''<br />201 passengers, {{efn|name|=|5ppm|assuming 5 passengers/m\u00b2}} <br />30 seats<br />''(13xx cars)''<br />196 passengers,<br />38 seats<br />''(14xx cars)''<br />''KCSV-5:''<br />201 passengers,<br />30 seats<br />''KCSV-7:''<br />192 passengers,<br />36 seats", "operator": "F\u0151v\u00e1rosi Villamosvas\u00fat (FVV),<br />Budapest,&nbsp; {{flag|Hungary}} <br />''(1965\u20131967)''<br />[[BKV Zrt.|Budapesti K\u00f6zleked\u00e9si V\u00e1llalat]] (BKV),<br />Budapest,&nbsp; {{flag|Hungary}} <br />''(1968\u2013present)''", "carbody": "[[Steel]]", "carlength": "''carbody:''<br /> {{convert|26000|mm|ftin|abbr|=|on}} <br />''between couplers:''<br /> {{convert|26900|mm|ftin|abbr|=|on}}", "width": "{{convert|2300|mm|ftin|abbr|=|on}}", "height": "''CSMG cars:''<br /> {{convert|3100|mm|ftin|abbr|=|on}} <br />''KCSV cars:''<br /> {{convert|3500|mm|ftin|abbr|=|on}}", "floorheight": "{{convert|850|mm|ftin|abbr|=|on}}", "entrylevelorstep": "step", "art-sections": "two<br />''CSMG-0 prototypes until 1974:''<br />one", "wheeldiameter": "{{convert|670|mm|ftin|abbr|=|on}}", "wheelbase": "{{convert|1800|mm|ftin|abbr|=|on}}", "doors": "folding doors,<br />5 per side,<br />2+2+2+2+2<br />''CSMG-0 prototypes until 1974:''<br />folding doors,<br />4 per side,<br />2+2+2+2", "maxspeed": "{{convert|50|kph|mph|abbr|=|on}}", "weight": "''CSMG cars:''<br /> {{convert|33600|kg|ST|abbr|=|on}} <br />''KCSV cars:''<br /> {{convert|34000|kg|ST|abbr|=|on}}", "traction": "4&nbsp;\u00d7 [[Ganz Works|Ganz]]&nbsp;TK&nbsp;44", "poweroutput": "''CSMG cars:''<br />4&nbsp;\u00d7 {{convert|66|hp-electrical|kW|abbr|=|on}} <br />(= {{convert|264|hp-electrical|kW|abbr|=|on}} )<br />''KCSV cars:''<br />4&nbsp;\u00d7 {{convert|61|hp-electrical|kW|abbr|=|on}} <br />(= {{convert|244|hp-electrical|kW|abbr|=|on}} )", "aux": "24&nbsp;V&nbsp;DC", "powersupply": "24&nbsp;V&nbsp;DC", "hvac": "electric heating<br />''(originally only on CSMG-1)''", "electricsystem": "600&nbsp;V&nbsp;DC from [[overhead line]]", "collectionmethod": "[[Pantograph (transport)|pantograph]]", "uicclass": "Bo'2'2'Bo'tr {{efn|name|=|UICtr|the UIC axle arrangement classification appendix \"tr\" officially denotes a tram vehicle}} <br />''CSMG-0 prototypes until 1974:''<br />Bo'2'Bo'tr", "bogies": "pivoting", "brakes": "electric", "safety": "proprietary tramset breakage sensing system", "coupling": "''mechanical:''<br />[[Alemann coupler|Alemann-type]] [[Cone coupler|trichterkupplung]]<br />''electrical:''<br />proprietary DC connectors", "multipleworking": "only with same type", "light": "[[incandescent light bulb]]s", "gauge": "{{RailGauge|sg}}"}, "wikidata": {"Commons category (P373)": "Ganz CSMG in Budapest", "instance of (P31)": "tram model (Q76154857)", "manufacturer (P176)": "Ganz Works (Q369524)", "operator (P137)": "Budapesti K\u00f6zleked\u00e9si Zrt.

The UV tramcars have four main variants, all are four axle rail motor coaches with a Bo'Bo'tr axle arrangement, capable of operating as electric multiple units. The cars were manufactured between 1956 and 1965 in Budapest, and overall 375 regular units and 2 prototypes were made.\nThe UV type designation resolves to U t\u00edpus\u00fa t\u00e1vvez\u00e9relt motorkocsi (\"type U remotely controlled motor coach\"). The units are capable of controlling another unit of their type through proprietary 50-wire cables. The trams are also capable of sensing the breakup of the tramset with the use of a chain hanging between the cars; brakes are automatically applied if a chain is pulled out from its sockets. Two prototypes were made with aluminium carbodies, designated as UZ, these proved to be unsuccessful. In addition, in the 1990s, 20 UV cars were refurbished and they are referred to as MUV (moderniz\u00e1lt UV, \"modernized UV\"). Planned to replace the pre-WWII design TM trams, with 377 units, the UV series became the most numerous type of tramcar produced in Hungary.\nThe first car entered passenger service in 1956, and the type was ultimately decommissioned in 2007, after roughly 51 years of continuous service. UV trams became one of the symbols of Budapest, and had appeared in a number of Hungarian and foreign movies as plot elements. Two preserved, paired UV cars now annually serve as the city's so-called Christmas light trams in the festive season, decorated with white and blue LED lights.\n\n\n== Design and manufacturing ==\nThe UV series was designed with the aid of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences, and was specifically intended to improve on and address the flaws of the then-current TM Stuka tramcars which debuted in 1939. In 1948, Ganz showcased a prototype tram set on the Budapest International Fair (BNV), made up from three modified TM cars damaged in the war. The modified TMs at the ends were referred to as TV, resolving to T t\u00edpus\u00fa t\u00e1vvez\u00e9relt motorkocsi (\"type T remotely controlled motor coach\"), the most significant alteration being that they were capable of operating as multiple units with each other with or without the third TM car acting as a plain trailer car in between. This prototype tram was nicknamed Szellem (\"Ghost\"). While the TV didn't reached mass production, it served as a basis for the UV design.\nEventually four main variants of UV tramcars were produced, with the UV4 variant reaching only the planning stage. These variants are shown in the following table.\n\nThere were no designs for a new trailer car for the UV series, and in practice, Budapest's tram operator (FVV, and its successor, BKV) used earlier EP and FP trailers. These were modified to support the UV control and power connections and to fit the UV aesthetics more closely.\nA prototype design was also manufactured with the designation UZ, with a lighter carbody made from aluminium. Only two tramcars were made in 1958 and 1959 since the design proved to be expensive to produce and fragile. The two cars however saw a few years of passenger service. Another prototype was made in 1962 from a pair of UV1 and UV2 tramcars damaged in a collision, these were joined to form an articulated vehicle (referred to as the iker-UV, \"twin UV\"), but the results were deemed unsuccessful, and the cars were separated and rebuilt as regular single cars.\nBetween 1993 and 1994, 20 of the UV3 tramcars were refurbished, and were designated as MUV (moderniz\u00e1lt UV, \"modernized UV\"). A significant change were the elimination of the power couplings between cars, as a consequence, car sets having MUV cars had to operate with all their pantographs in an active position.\nUV-related prototypes, refurbishments and other related vehicles are shown in the following table.\n\n\n== See also ==\nGanz TM\nFVV CSM\nGanz CSMG\nTrams in Budapest\nGanz Works\nR\u00e1ba (company)\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==", "infobox": {"background": "#F5C71A", "name": "Ganz UV", "image": "Lijn47UVwagn.jpg", "caption": "An UV tramset on Budapest's line 47 in 1992", "service": "1956\u20132007<br />(~51 years)", "manufacturer": "''underframe and bogies:''<br />[[Ganz Works|Ganz Vagon- \u00e9s G\u00e9pgy\u00e1r]]<br />[[Budapest]],&nbsp; {{flag|Hungary}} <br />''carbody:''<br />[[R\u00e1ba (company)|R\u00e1ba Magyar Vagon- \u00e9s G\u00e9pgy\u00e1r]],<br />[[Gy\u0151r]],&nbsp; {{flag|Hungary}} <br />''traction system:''<br />[[Ganz Works|Klement Gottwald Villamoss\u00e1gi Gy\u00e1r]]<br />[[Budapest]],&nbsp; {{flag|Hungary}}", "replaced": "[[Ganz TM]] ''Stuka''", "yearconstruction": "''UV1:'' 1956\u20131957<br />''UV2:'' 1958\u20131959<br />''UV3:'' 1959\u20131961<br />''UV5:'' 1962\u20131965<br />''UZ:'' 1958\u20131959", "yearservice": "1956<br />( {{Years or months ago|1956}} )", "refurbishment": "1993\u20131994<br />''(20 UV into MUV)''", "yearscrapped": "1990s\u20132007<br />( {{Years or months ago|2007}} )", "numberbuilt": "''UV1:'' 50<br />''UV2:'' 100<br />''UV3:'' 125<br />''UV4:'' 0<br />''UV5:'' 100<br />''UZ:'' 2<br />''total:'' 377", "numberservice": "0", "numberpreserved": "at least 11 cars<br />(multiple variants)", "numberscrapped": "n.a.", "formation": "MC, {{efn|name|=|MC|MC stands for [[Motor coach (rail)|motor coach]]}} MC+TR, {{efn|name|=|TR|TR stands for [[Trailer (vehicle)|trailer car]]}} MC+TR+MC, MC+MC", "fleetnumbers": "''UV1:'' 3200\u20133249<br />''UV2:'' 3250\u20133349<br />''UV3:'' 3350\u20133474<br />''UV5:'' 3800\u20133899", "capacity": "94 passengers {{efn|name|=|5ppm|assuming 5 passengers/m\u00b2}}", "operator": "F\u0151v\u00e1rosi Villamosvas\u00fat (FVV),<br />Budapest,&nbsp; {{flag|Hungary}} <br />''(1956\u20131967)''<br />[[BKV Zrt.|Budapesti K\u00f6zleked\u00e9si V\u00e1llalat]] (BKV),<br />Budapest,&nbsp; {{flag|Hungary}} <br />''(1968\u20132007)''", "carbody": "''UV1, UV2, UV3, UV5:''<br />steel,<br />''UZ:''<br />aluminium", "carlength": "''carbody:''<br /> {{convert|12600|mm|ftin|abbr|=|on}} <br />''between couplers:''<br /> {{convert|13500|mm|ftin|abbr|=|on}} <br />''(UV1, UV2, UV3)''<br /> {{convert|13690|mm|ftin|abbr|=|on}} <br />''(UV5)''", "width": "{{convert|2300|mm|ftin|abbr|=|on}}", "height": "{{convert|3100|mm|ftin|abbr|=|on}}", "floorheight": "{{convert|783|mm|ftin|abbr|=|on}} <br />''(midsection)''<br /> {{convert|668|mm|ftin|abbr|=|on}} <br />''(end sections)''", "entrylevelorstep": "step", "wheeldiameter": "{{convert|670|mm|ftin|abbr|=|on}}", "doors": "telescopic sliding doors,<br />3 per side<br />''UV1, UV2, UV3:''<br />2+1+2<br />''UV5:''<br />2+2+2", "maxspeed": "{{convert|50|kph|mph|abbr|=|on}}", "weight": "{{convert|19750|kg|ST|abbr|=|on}}", "traction": "4&nbsp;\u00d7 [[Ganz Works|Ganz]]&nbsp;TA&nbsp;1.18<br />''initially in early cars:''<br />4&nbsp;\u00d7 Ganz&nbsp;TA&nbsp;1.12", "poweroutput": "4&nbsp;\u00d7 {{convert|50|hp-electrical|kW|abbr|=|on}} <br />(= {{convert|200|hp-electrical|kW|abbr|=|on}} )<br />''initially in early cars:''<br />4&nbsp;\u00d7 {{convert|42|hp-electrical|kW|abbr|=|on}} <br />(= {{convert|168|hp-electrical|kW|abbr|=|on}} )", "aux": "24&nbsp;V&nbsp;DC", "powersupply": "600&nbsp;V&nbsp;DC<br />''(except MUV cars)''", "hvac": "electric heating", "electricsystem": "600&nbsp;V&nbsp;DC from [[overhead line]]", "collectionmethod": "[[Pantograph (transport)|pantograph]]", "uicclass": "Bo'Bo'tr {{efn|name|=|UICtr|the UIC axle arrangement classification appendix \"tr\" officially denotes a tram vehicle}}", "bogies": "pivoting", "brakes": "electric, electro-pneumatic", "safety": "proprietary tramset breakage sensing system", "coupling": "''mechanical:''<br />[[Alemann coupler|Alemann-type]] [[Cone coupler|trichterkupplung]]<br />''electrical:''<br />proprietary DC connectors", "multipleworking": "only with same type", "light": "[[incandescent light bulb]]s", "gauge": "{{track gauge|sg}}"}, "wikidata": {"image (P18)": "UV villamos (3888).jpg", "instance of (P31)": "tram model (Q76154857)", "manufacturer (P176)": "Ganz Works (Q369524)", "Commons category (P373)": "UV trams", "has use (P366)": "public transport (Q178512)", "operator (P137)": "Budapesti K\u00f6zleked\u00e9si Zrt.

The one with hot-tube ignition and injection nozzle carburetor equipped engine was the first prototype built yet behind the rear axle and driving the rear wheels through a four-speed belt drive. The car had turntable steering and a manually operated block brake that acted on the iron tires on the rear wheels. There was also a foot-operated shoe brake on the countershaft. The vehicle was 4.5 m long and 1.5 m wide, the payload was given as 1500 kg and the top speed was 12 kmph. Its purchase price was 5,200 marks.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\nOn October 1, 1896, Daimler sold the first truck (\u201cOrder No. 81\u201d) to the British Motor Syndicate in London . In this model, the motor had been enlarged to 1.53 liters  with 6 HP (4.4 kW), was installed under the driver's seat. In the same year, Daimler-Motoren-Gesellschaft was the first vehicle manufacturer in the world to launch a model range of various trucks that were available in four different power levels: 2.9 kW, 4.4 kW, 5.9 kW and 7.4 kW. The payloads ranged from 1.2 ton to 5 tons.According to documents from Daimler were delivered by January 1899 \"ten load and thirteen Bierwagen\". Customers included the Paul von Maur freight forwarder in Stuttgart and the Bohemian brewery in Berlin, which used the Daimler motor truck as a \"beer wear truck\".\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nWerner Oswald: Mercedes-Benz Lastwagen und Omnibusse 1886\u20131986.

Sculptor Gutzon Borglum created the sculpture's design and oversaw the project's execution from 1927 to 1941 with the help of his son, Lincoln Borglum. The sculpture features the 60-foot (18 m) heads of Presidents George Washington (1732\u20131799), Thomas Jefferson (1743\u20131826), Theodore Roosevelt (1858\u20131919) and Abraham Lincoln (1809\u20131865), as recommended by Borglum. The four presidents were chosen to represent the nation's birth, growth, development and preservation, respectively. The memorial park covers 1,278 acres (2.00 sq mi; 5.17 km2) and the actual mountain has an elevation of 5,725 feet (1,745 m) above sea level.The sculptor and tribal representatives settled on Mount Rushmore, which also has the advantage of facing southeast for maximum sun exposure. Doane Robinson wanted it to feature American West heroes, such as Lewis and Clark, their expedition guide Sacagawea, Oglala Lakota chief Red Cloud, Buffalo Bill Cody, and Oglala Lakota chief Crazy Horse. Borglum believed that the sculpture should have broader appeal and chose the four presidents.\nPeter Norbeck, U.S. senator from South Dakota, sponsored the project and secured federal funding. Construction began in 1927; the presidents' faces were completed between 1934 and 1939. After Gutzon Borglum died in March 1941, his son Lincoln took over as leader of the construction project. Each president was originally to be depicted from head to waist, but lack of funding forced construction to end on October 31, 1941.Sometimes referred to as the \"Shrine of Democracy\", Mount Rushmore attracts more than two million visitors annually.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nMount Rushmore was conceived with the intention of creating a site to lure tourists, representing \"not only the wild grandeur of its local geography but also the triumph of western civilization over that geography through its anthropomorphic representation.\" Though for the latest occupants of the land at the time, the Lakota Sioux, as well as other tribes, the monument in their view \"came to epitomize the loss of their sacred lands and the injustices they've suffered under the U.S. government.\" Under the Treaty of 1868, the U.S. government promised the territory, including the entirety of the Black Hills, to the Sioux \"so long as the buffalo may range thereon in such numbers as to justify the chase.\" After the discovery of gold on the land, American settlers migrated to the area in the 1870s. The federal government then forced the Sioux to relinquish the Black Hills portion of their reservation.The four presidential faces were said to be carved into the granite with the intention of symbolizing \"an accomplishment born, planned, and created in the minds and by the hands of Americans for Americans\".\n\n\n=== Naming ===\nMount Rushmore was known to the Lakota Sioux as \"The Six Grandfathers\" (T\u021fu\u014bk\u00e1\u0161ila \u0160\u00e1kpe) or \"Cougar Mountain\" (Igm\u00fat\u021fa\u014bka Pah\u00e1); but American settlers knew it variously as Cougar Mountain, Sugarloaf Mountain, Slaughterhouse Mountain and Keystone Cliffs. As Six Grandfathers, the mountain was on the route that Lakota leader Black Elk took in a spiritual journey that culminated at Black Elk Peak. Following a series of military campaigns from 1876 to 1878, the United States asserted control over the area, a claim that is still disputed on the basis of the 1868 Treaty of Fort Laramie.Beginning with a prospecting expedition in 1885 with David Swanzey (husband of Carrie Ingalls), and Bill Challis, wealthy investor Charles E. Rushmore began visiting the area regularly on prospecting and hunting trips. He repeatedly joked with colleagues about naming the mountain after himself. The United States Board of Geographic Names officially recognized the name \"Mount Rushmore\" in June 1930.\n\n\n=== Concept, design and funding ===\nHistorian Doane Robinson conceived the idea for Mount Rushmore in 1923 to promote tourism in South Dakota. In 1924, Robinson persuaded sculptor Gutzon Borglum to travel to the Black Hills region to ensure the carving could be accomplished. The original plan was to make the carvings in granite pillars known as the Needles. However, Borglum realized that the eroded Needles were too thin to support sculpting. He chose Mount Rushmore, a grander location, partly because it faced southeast and enjoyed maximum exposure to the sun.Borglum said upon seeing Mount Rushmore, \"America will march along that skyline.\"Borglum had been involved in sculpting the Stone Mountain Memorial to Confederate leaders in Georgia, but was in disagreement with the officials there.After long negotiations involving a congressional delegation and President Calvin Coolidge, the project received congressional approval on March 3, 1925. The carving started in 1927 and ended in 1941 with no fatalities.\n\n\n=== Construction ===\nBetween October 4, 1927, and October 31, 1941, Gutzon Borglum and 400 workers sculpted the colossal 60-foot-high (18 m) carvings of United States Presidents George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Theodore Roosevelt, and Abraham Lincoln to represent the first 150 years of American history. These presidents were selected by Borglum because of their role in preserving the Republic and expanding its territory. The carving of Mount Rushmore involved the use of dynamite, followed by the process of \"honeycombing\", a process where workers drill holes close together, allowing small pieces to be removed by hand. In total, about 450,000 short tons (410,000 t) of rock were blasted off the mountainside. The image of Thomas Jefferson was originally intended to appear in the area at Washington's right, but after the work there was begun, the rock was found to be unsuitable, so the work on the Jefferson figure was dynamited, and a new figure was sculpted to Washington's left.\n\nThe chief carver of the mountain was Luigi Del Bianco, an artisan and stonemason in Port Chester, New York. Del Bianco emigrated to the U.S. from Friuli in Italy and was chosen to work on this project because of his understanding of sculptural language and ability to imbue emotion in the carved portraits.In 1933, the National Park Service took Mount Rushmore under its jurisdiction. Julian Spotts helped with the project by improving its infrastructure. For example, he had the tram upgraded so it could reach the top of Mount Rushmore for the ease of workers. By July 4, 1934, Washington's face had been completed and was dedicated. The face of Thomas Jefferson was dedicated in 1936, and the face of Abraham Lincoln was dedicated on September 17, 1937. In 1937, a bill was introduced in Congress to add the head of civil-rights leader Susan B. Anthony, but a rider was passed on an appropriations bill requiring federal funds be used to finish only those heads that had already been started at that time. In 1939, the face of Theodore Roosevelt was dedicated.The Sculptor's Studio \u2013 a display of unique plaster models and tools related to the sculpting \u2013 was built in 1939 under the direction of Borglum. Borglum died from an embolism in March 1941. His son, Lincoln Borglum, continued the project. Originally, it was planned that the figures would be carved from head to waist, but insufficient funding forced the carving to end.  Borglum had also planned a massive panel in the shape of the Louisiana Purchase commemorating in eight-foot-tall gilded letters the Declaration of Independence, U.S. Constitution, Louisiana Purchase, and seven other territorial acquisitions from the Alaska purchase to the Panama Canal Zone. In total, the entire project cost US$989,992.32 (equivalent to $18.2 million in 2021).Nick Clifford, the last remaining carver, died in November 2019 at age 98.\n\n\n=== Visitor center ===\nHarold Spitznagel and Cecil Doty designed the original visitor center, finished in 1957. These structures were part of the Mission 66 effort to improve visitors' facilities at national parks and monuments across the country.Ten years of redevelopment work culminated with the completion of extensive visitor facilities and sidewalks in 1998, such as a Visitor Center, the Lincoln Borglum Museum, and the Presidential Trail. Maintenance of the memorial requires mountain climbers to monitor and seal cracks annually. Due to budget constraints, the memorial is not regularly cleaned to remove lichens. However, on July 8, 2005, Alfred K\u00e4rcher, a German manufacturer of pressure washing and steam cleaning machines, conducted a free cleanup operation which lasted several weeks, using pressurized water at over 200 \u00b0F (93 \u00b0C).On October 15, 1966, Mount Rushmore was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. A 500-word essay giving the history of the United States by Nebraska student William Andrew Burkett was selected as the college-age group winner in a 1934 competition, and that essay was placed on the Entablature on a bronze plate in 1973. In 1991, President George H. W. Bush officially dedicated Mount Rushmore.\n\n\n=== Proposals of adding additional faces ===\nIn 1937, when the sculpture was not yet complete, a bill in Congress supporting the addition of women's rights activist Susan B. Anthony failed. When the sculpture was completed in 1941, the sculptors stated that the remaining rock was not suitable for additional carvings. This stance was shared by RESPEC, an engineering firm charged with monitoring the stability of the rock in 1989. However, proposals of additional sculptures have been made regardless. These include John F. Kennedy after his assassination in 1963, and Ronald Reagan in 1985 and 1999 \u2013 the latter proposal receiving a debate in Congress at the time. Barack Obama was asked about his own potential addition in 2008 and he joked that his ears were too large.According to a survey of political science experts conducted by The New York Times in 2018, Franklin D. Roosevelt is the most popular choice for addition to Mount Rushmore, regardless of party affiliation. In total, 66% of respondents would choose Roosevelt, followed by Barack Obama at 7% and Ronald Reagan at 5%. Among Democrats, Roosevelt was chosen by 75%, followed by Barack Obama at 11%. Among Republicans, Roosevelt was chosen by 43%, followed by Reagan at 19%. Among Independents, Roosevelt was chosen by 57%, followed by both Reagan and Dwight D. Eisenhower at 11%.\n\n\n== Tourism ==\nTourism is South Dakota's second-largest industry, and Mount Rushmore is the state's top tourist attraction. In 2012, 2,185,447 people visited the park.In the 1950s and 1960s, local Lakota Sioux elder Benjamin Black Elk (son of medicine man Black Elk, who had been present at the Battle of the Little Bighorn) was known as the \"Fifth Face of Mount Rushmore\", posing for photographs with thousands of tourists daily in his native attire. The South Dakota State Historical Society notes that he was one of the most photographed people in the world over that twenty-year period.\n\n\n== Hall of Records ==\n\nBorglum originally envisioned a grand Hall of Records where America's greatest historical documents and artifacts could be protected and shown to tourists. He managed to start the project, but cut only 70 feet (21 m) into the rock before work stopped in 1939 to focus on the faces. In 1998, an effort to complete Borglum's vision resulted in a repository being constructed inside the mouth of the cave housing 16 enamel panels that contained biographical and historical information about Mount Rushmore as well as the texts of the documents Borglum wanted to preserve there. The vault consists of a teakwood box (housing the 16 panels) inside of a titanium vault placed in the ground with a granite capstone. The text found on the 16 panels can be found below.\n\n\n== Conservation ==\nThe ongoing conservation of the site is overseen by the National Park Service. Physical efforts to conserve the monument have included replacement of the sealant applied originally to cracks in the stone by Gutzon Borglum, which had proved ineffective at providing water resistance. The components of Borglum's sealant included linseed oil, granite dust, and white lead, but a modern silicone replacement for the cracks is now used, disguised with granite dust.In 1998, electronic monitoring devices were installed to track movement in the topology of the sculpture to an accuracy of three millimeters. The site was digitally recorded in 2009 using a terrestrial laser scanning method as part of the international Scottish Ten project, providing a high-resolution record to aid the conservation of the site. This data was made publicly accessible online.\n\n\n== Ecology ==\n\nThe flora and fauna of Mount Rushmore are similar to those of the rest of the Black Hills region of South Dakota. Birds including the turkey vulture, golden eagle, bald eagle, red-tailed hawk, swallows and white-throated swifts fly around Mount Rushmore, occasionally making nesting spots in the ledges of the mountain. Smaller birds, including songbirds, nuthatches, woodpeckers and flycatchers inhabit the surrounding pine forests. Terrestrial mammals include the mouse, least chipmunk, red squirrel, skunk, porcupine, raccoon, beaver, badger, coyote, bighorn sheep, bobcat, elk, mule deer, yellow-bellied marmot, and American bison. The striped chorus frog, western chorus frog, and northern leopard frog also inhabit the area, along with several species of snake. Grizzly Bear Brook and Starling Basin Brook, the two streams in the memorial, support fish such as the longnose dace and the brook trout. Mountain goats are not indigenous to the region. Those living near Mount Rushmore are descendants of a tribe that Canada gifted to Custer State Park in 1924, which later escaped.At lower elevations, coniferous trees, mainly the ponderosa pine, surround most of the monument, providing shade from the sun. Other trees include the bur oak, the Black Hills spruce, and the cottonwood. Nine species of shrubs grow near Mount Rushmore. There is also a wide variety of wildflowers, including especially the snapdragon, sunflower, and violet. Towards higher elevations, plant life becomes sparser. However, only approximately five percent of the plant species found in the Black Hills are indigenous to the region.The area receives about 18 inches (460 mm) of precipitation on average per year, enough to support abundant animal and plant life. Trees and other plants help to control surface runoff. Dikes, seeps, and springs help to dam up water that is flowing downhill, providing watering spots for animals. In addition, stones like sandstone and limestone help to hold groundwater, creating aquifers.A 2016 investigation by the U.S. Geological Survey found unusually high concentrations of perchlorate in the surface water and groundwater of the area. A sample collected from a stream had a maximum perchlorate concentration of 54 micrograms per liter, roughly 270 times higher than samples taken from locations outside the area. The report concluded the probable cause of the contamination was the aerial fireworks displays that had taken place on Independence Days from 1998 to 2009. The National Park Service also reported that at least 27 forest fires around Mount Rushmore in that same period (1998 to 2009) have been caused by fireworks displays.A study of the fire scars present in tree ring samples indicates that forest fires occur in the ponderosa forests surrounding Mount Rushmore around every 27 years. Large fires are not common. Most events have been ground fires that serve to clear forest debris. The area is a climax community. Recent pine beetle infestations have threatened the forest.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Geology ===\n\nMount Rushmore is largely composed of granite. The memorial is carved on the northwest margin of the Black Elk Peak granite batholith in the Black Hills of South Dakota, so the geologic formations of the heart of the Black Hills region are also evident at Mount Rushmore. The batholith magma intruded into the pre-existing mica schist rocks during the Proterozoic, 1.6 billion years ago. Coarse grained pegmatite dikes are associated with the granite intrusion of Black Elk Peak and are visibly lighter in color, thus explaining the light-colored streaks on the foreheads of the presidents.The Black Hills granites were exposed to erosion during the Neoproterozoic, but were later buried by sandstone and other sediments during the Cambrian. Remaining buried throughout the Paleozoic, they were re-exposed again during the Laramide orogeny around 70 million years ago. The Black Hills area was uplifted as an elongated geologic dome. Subsequent erosion stripped the granite of the overlying sediments and the softer adjacent schist. Some schist does remain and can be seen as the darker material just below the sculpture of Washington.The tallest mountain in the region is Black Elk Peak (7,242 ft or 2,207 m). Borglum selected Mount Rushmore as the site for several reasons. The rock of the mountain is composed of smooth, fine-grained granite. The durable granite erodes only 1 inch (25 mm) every 10,000 years, thus was more than sturdy enough to support the sculpture and its long-term exposure. The mountain's height of 5,725 feet (1,745 m) above sea level made it suitable, and because it faces the southeast, the workers also had the advantage of sunlight for most of the day.\nIt is not possible to add another president to the memorial, because the rock that surrounds the existing faces is not suitable for additional carving, and because if additional sculpting work were done, that might create instabilities in the existing carvings.\n\n\n=== Soils ===\nThe Mount Rushmore area is underlain by well drained alfisol soils of very gravelly loam (Mocmount) to silt loam (Buska) texture, brown to dark grayish brown.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nMount Rushmore has a dry-winter humid continental climate (Dwb in the K\u00f6ppen climate classification). It is inside a USDA Plant Hardiness Zone of 5a, meaning certain plant life in the area can withstand a low temperature of no less than \u221220 \u00b0F (\u221229 \u00b0C).The two wettest months of the year are May and June. Orographic lift causes brief but strong afternoon thunderstorms during the summer.\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\n\nBecause of its fame as a monument, Mount Rushmore has been depicted in multiple places in popular culture.\n\n\n== Controversies ==\n\nThe Treaty of Fort Laramie (1868) had granted the Black Hills to the Lakota people in perpetuity, but the United States took the area from the tribe after the Great Sioux War of 1876. Members of the American Indian Movement led an occupation of the monument in 1971, naming it \"Mount Crazy Horse\", and Lakota holy man John Fire Lame Deer planted a prayer staff on top of the mountain. Lame Deer said that the staff formed a symbolic shroud over the presidents' faces \"which shall remain dirty until the treaties concerning the Black Hills are fulfilled.\"Construction on the Crazy Horse Memorial began in 1940 elsewhere in the Black Hills. Ostensibly to commemorate the Native American leader and as a response to Mount Rushmore, if completed it would be larger than Mount Rushmore. The Crazy Horse Memorial Foundation has rejected offers of federal funds. Its construction has the support of some Lakota chiefs, but it is the subject of controversy, even among Native American tribes.The 1980 United States Supreme Court decision United States v. Sioux Nation of Indians ruled that the Sioux had not received just compensation for their land in the Black Hills, which includes Mount Rushmore. The court proposed $102 million as compensation for the loss of the Black Hills. This compensation was valued at $1.3 billion in 2011, and \u2013 with accumulated interest \u2013 nearly $2 billion in 2021. In 2020, Oglala Lakota Nation citizen and Indigenous activist Nick Tilsen explained that his people would not accept a settlement, \"because we won't settle for anything less than the full return of our lands as stipulated by the treaties our nations signed and agreed upon.\"In 2004, Gerard Baker was appointed superintendent of the park, the first and so far only Native American in that role. Baker stated that he will open up more \"avenues of interpretation\", and that the four presidents are \"only one avenue and only one focus.\"On July 3, 2020, scores of activists demonstrated when President Donald Trump held a campaign rally at Mount Rushmore. The foremost message was that Indigenous people want their land back, pursuant to the ongoing dispute of the Black Hills land claim. Twenty people were arrested.\n\n\n== Legacy and commemoration ==\n\nOn August 11, 1952, the U.S. Post Office issued the Mount Rushmore Memorial 3-cent commemorative stamp on the 25th anniversary of the dedication of the Mount Rushmore National Memorial. On January 2, 1974, a 26-cent airmail stamp depicting the monument was also issued.In 1991 the United States Mint released a commemorative silver dollar celebrating the 50th anniversary of the monument's dedication, and the sculpture was the main subject of the 2006 South Dakota state quarter.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of colossal sculpture in situ\nList of tallest statues\nCrazy Horse Memorial, another large sculpture in the Black Hills\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\n\"Making Mount Rushmore\".

The mountaintop is the site of the Mount Soledad Cross, the subject of a 25-year controversy over the involvement of religion in government which concluded in 2016.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nThe 823-foot (251 m) mountain lies between Interstate 5 to the east and the Pacific Ocean to the west. It is mostly within the community of La Jolla where the northern and eastern slopes form a sharp escarpment along the Rose Canyon fault. The community of Pacific Beach is on the gentler southern slope. There are several radio and television transmitters located on the summit including KFMB-TV and KGTV, the CBS and ABC affiliates respectively. Commercial aircraft approaching San Diego from the direction of Los Angeles often use Mount Soledad as their point to start the downwind leg of their approach to San Diego International Airport.\n\n\n== Land events ==\nOn October 3, 2007, one home on Soledad Mountain Road and one of the main roads up the mountain was destroyed by a major landslide.  Five houses were damaged, and over 20 others were evacuated.  The city of San Diego had noticed water and gas main leaks since July, and cracks in the pavement since August 2007.\n\n\n== Legend of Munchkin land ==\nThere is an urban legend that in the 1930s, a group of little people who appeared in Hollywood films such as The Wizard of Oz, came to San Diego, where they built miniature houses on Mount Soledad.The legend gained traction due to the fact several houses were built on steep slopes overlooking the Pacific. As passing observers looked down, the perspective made doors and other features appear smaller than normal. Most of the supposed \"Munchkin Houses\" have been remodeled and the effect is no longer present.\n\n\n== Last home of Dr. Seuss ==\nMount Soledad is the location of the last home lived in by Dr. Seuss. His widow, Audrey Geisel, resided atop Mount Soledad in a lavish home, which includes an observation tower referred to as the Seuss house by the locals, until her death in 2018.\n\n\n== Cycling ==\nBecause of the variety of long steady climbs, light traffic on most routes, and great views, Mount Soledad is a popular cycling destination and area.  There are numerous routes ranging from the relatively gradual, 3.5-mile (5.6 km) climb up Soledad Mountain Road on the southern slopes to the very steep and short, 1.25-mile (2.0 km), Hidden Valley Road to Via Capri route on the north side.\n\n\n== Mount Soledad Cross ==\n\nMount Soledad is topped by a large concrete Christian cross, first built in 1913, and since rebuilt twice. The third and current version was dedicated in 1954 as the Mount Soledad Easter Cross; the word \"Easter\" was dropped in the 1980s. After the cross was challenged in court during the late 1980s, it was designated a Korean War memorial. It became the center of a controversy over the display of religious symbols on government property.It was ruled unconstitutional by the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in January 2011.On June 25, 2012, the United States Supreme Court denied certiorari, allowing the order of the Ninth Circuit to stand.In July 2015, a group called the Mt. Soledad Memorial Association reported that it had bought the half-acre of land under the cross from the Department of Defense for $1.4 million. On September 7, 2016 the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit issued a one-page ruling, ordering dismissal of the case and an end to all current appeals, stating that the case was now moot because the cross was no longer on government land. Both sides agreed that this decision puts a final end to the case.\n\n\n== See also ==\nSan Diego Historical Landmarks in La Jolla, California\n\n\n== References ==", "infobox": {"name": "Mount Soledad", "photo": "Soledad from Torrey Pines.jpg", "photo_size": "285", "photo_alt": "Finger of a mountain visible behind a cliff and on a beach with a partly cloudy sky", "photo_caption": "Mount Soledad seen from the north in [[Torrey Pines State Reserve]], [[La Jolla]], [[San Diego]], [[California]]", "elevation_ft": "823", "elevation_ref": "{{NAVD88}}", "prominence_ft": "472", "location": "[[La Jolla, California|La Jolla]], [[San Diego County, California|San Diego, County]], [[California]], [[United States|U.S.]]", "map": "United States San Diego Northwestern", "map_alt": "Location within Northwestern San Diego", "map_caption": "Location within Northwestern San Diego", "map_size": "250", "label": "Mount Soledad", "label_position": "bottom", "coordinates": "{{coord|32.839866731|N|117.252491236|W|type:mountain_region:US-CA_scale:100000_source:ngs|format|=|dms|display|=|inline,title}}", "topo": "[[United States Geological Survey|USGS]] La Jolla"}, "wikidata": {"instance of (P31)": ["mountain (Q8502)", "tourist attraction (Q570116)"], "coordinate location (P625)": {"latitude": 32.839722222222, "longitude": -117.25222222222, "altitude": null, "precision": 0.00027777777777778, "globe": "http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q2"}, "country (P17)": "United States of America (Q30)", "located in the administrative territorial entity (P131)": "San Diego County (Q108143)", "image (P18)": "Mount Soledad from anwhere.jpg", "elevation above sea level (P2044)": {"amount": "+824", "unit": "http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q3710"}, "topographic prominence (P2660)": {"amount": "+472", "unit": "http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q3710", "upperBound": "+472", "lowerBound": "+472"}, "GNIS ID (P590)": "1661465", "Peakbagger mountain ID (P3109)": "21350", "Getty Thesaurus of Geographic Names ID (P1667)": "2675459", "LoJ peak ID (P3907)": "70541", "Commons category (P373)": "Mount Soledad", "GeoNames ID (P1566)": "5397026", "category for the view from the item (P8933)": "Category:Views from Mount Soledad (Q104235943)", "Freebase ID (P646)": "/m/0492k3"}, "cat": "Monuments_and_memorials", "url": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Soledad"}, {"name": "Washington Monument State Park", "url_name": "2637009", "txt": "Washington Monument State Park is a public recreation area located approximately one mile (1.6 km) southeast of Boonsboro, Maryland. The park preserves the Washington Monument, a 40-foot-tall (12 m) tower honoring George Washington, the first President of the United States. The monument sits along the Appalachian Trail near the summit of South Mountain's Monument Knob. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1972. The park is managed by the Maryland Department of Natural Resources.\n\n\n== History ==\nBuilt in 1827, the original tower was the first monument dedicated to George Washington to be completed.  The Washington Monument in Baltimore was completed two years later, although it had been started considerably earlier in 1815.  The famous Washington Monument in the District of Columbia was not completed until 1885.\nThe dry-laid stone tower was built on July 4, 1827, by the citizens of Boonsboro who marched to the site en masse after assembling in the town square at 7 a.m. At the end of that day, the tower stood at 15 feet (4.6 m) high on a base 54 feet (16 m) in circumference. Later that year, \"after the busy season\", workmen returned to complete the tower to a height of 30 feet (9.1 m).Owen Brown was the son of Abolitionist John Brown and the highest ranking surviving, uncaptured member of the party assembled for John Brown's Raid on Harpers Ferry.  Owen led a party of five escapees from the failed raid to safety in the north. On or about the night of October 23, 1859 these men ascended the slope of South Mountain after circling around Turner's Gap to avoid the men and dogs lying in wait for them in the mountain pass.  To their astonishment, there on the crest of the mountain was an odd stone tower.  Owen Brown retold the experience during his only known interview in 1873, both he and the interviewer then still apparently unaware the men had stumbled upon Washington's Monument.Although it was a popular meeting place for the citizenry of Boonsboro, weather and vandalism reduced the monument to rubble. In that condition, it was used by the Union Army as a signal station during the Civil War.\n\n\n=== First restoration ===\nIn 1882, the Odd Fellows Lodge of Boonsboro sponsored the tower's restoration. A canopy was added and a vehicle road built up the mountainside. A decade later, however, the tower again fell into ruin when a crack in the wall was not repaired.\n\n\n=== State park ===\nThe Washington County Historical Society purchased the one-acre (0.40 ha) site in 1920 and deeded it to the state for use as a state park in 1934.\n\n\n=== CCC restoration ===\nThe tower was rebuilt in its present form by members of the Civilian Conservation Corps. Workers set in place the original cornerstone and a facsimile of the dedication tablet (pictured at right), and a third dedication ceremony was held on July 4, 1936.\n\n\n== Activities and amenities ==\nThe park offers access to the Appalachian Trail, picnicking facilities, and a museum with \nexhibits on the natural and cultural history of the area.\n\n\n== See also ==\nMemorials dedicated to George Washington\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nWashington Monument State Park Maryland Department of Natural Resources", "infobox": {"name": "Washington Monument State Park", "iucn_category": "III", "photo": "Washington Monument, Western Maryland, Angled View.jpg", "map": "USA Maryland", "map_size": "280", "map_caption": "Location in Maryland", "relief": "1", "location": "[[Frederick County, Maryland|Frederick County]] & [[Washington County, Maryland|Washington County]], [[Maryland]], [[United States]]", "nearest_town": "[[Boonsboro, Maryland]]", "coordinates": "{{coord|39|29|54|N|77|37|32|W|display|=|inline,title}}", "area_acre": "191", "elevation": "{{convert|1401|ft|m|abbr|=|on}}", "designation": "[[List of Maryland state parks|Maryland state park]]", "established": "1934", "administrator": "[[Maryland Department of Natural Resources]]", "website": "[http://dnr.maryland.gov/publiclands/Pages/western/washington.aspx Washington Monument State Park]", "embedded": "{{Infobox NRHP\n  | embed |=| yes\n  | name |=| Washington Monument\n  | nrhp_type |=| \n  | image |=| Boonsboro Washington Monument.JPG\n  | caption |=| ''Erected in Memory of Washington July 4th 1827 by the citizens of Boonsboro''\n  | image_size |=| 280\n  | nearest_city |=| [[Boonsboro, Maryland]]\n  | coordinates |=| \n  | locmapin |=| \n  | built |=| 1827\n  | architect |=|\n  | builder |=| Isaac C.

Located in a small private cemetery in Kittery, it depicts the locally important shipbuilding magnate Samuel Badger (1794-1857).  The monument was designed by David M. French of Newmarket, New Hampshire, and was completed in 1858.  It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1998.\n\n\n== Description and history ==\nThe Samuel Badger Monument is located in a small private cemetery in a residential area of Kittery Foreside, a village of Kittery on the banks of the Piscataqua River, not far from Badger's Island.  The cemetery has a small number of graves, which all appear to be related to Samuel Badger and his immediate family, many of whom predeceased him.  The cemetery is surrounded by houses, and is not readily accessible to the public.  The monument is a stepped rectangular granite shaft, set on a granite foundation.  In a niche on one side with a curved ceiling stands a marble bust of Badger.  The tier at the base of the shaft has the Badger name in raised letters, and the next tier depicts a 19th-century sailing ship.  The shaft is topped by a low gabled pediment with a star at its center.  The bust of Badger was designed by David M. French of Newmarket, New Hampshire, and was installed in 1858.  The circumstances of its commissioning are not known.Samuel Badger was one of the major shipbuilders on the Piscataqua River in the mid-19th century.  He was the nephew of William Badger, a shipbuilder for whom Badger's Island is named.  He served for many years under his uncle at his shipyard, and took over that business upon the elder Badger's death in 1830.  From then until his own death in 1857, the Badger shipyard produced 45 packet ships.\n\n\n== See also ==\nNational Register of Historic Places listings in York County, Maine\n\n\n== References ==", "infobox": {"name": "Samuel Badger Monument", "image": "KitteryME BadgerMonument.jpg", "location": "[[Kittery, Maine|Kittery Foreside, Maine]]", "locmapin": "Maine#USA", "built": "{{Start date|1858}}", "architect": "French, David M.", "added": "January 7, 1998", "area": "less than one acre", "refnum": "97001640"}, "wikidata": {"image (P18)": "KitteryME BadgerMonument.jpg", "located in the administrative territorial entity (P131)": "Kittery (Q973112)", "NRHP reference number (P649)": "97001640", "country (P17)": "United States of America (Q30)", "archINFORM project ID (P5383)": "80915", "instance of (P31)": "sepulchral monument (Q56055312)", "inception (P571)": "+1858-00-00T00:00:00Z", "heritage designation (P1435)": "National Register of Historic Places listed place (Q19558910)", "coordinate location (P625)": {"latitude": 43.086666666666666, "longitude": -70.745, "altitude": null, "precision": 0.0002777777777777778, "globe": "http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q2"}, "Freebase ID (P646)": "/m/0136_2b5"}, "cat": "Monuments_and_memorials", "url": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Badger_Monument"}, {"name": "Dexter Graves Monument", "url_name": "33349014", "txt": "Eternal Silence, alternatively known as the Dexter Graves Monument or the Statue of Death, is a monument in Chicago's Graceland Cemetery and features a bronze sculpture set upon, and backdropped by, black granite. It was created by American sculptor Lorado Taft in 1909.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe monument commemorates Dexter Graves, who in 1831 led a group of thirteen families from Ohio to settle in Chicago. Graves died in 1844, 75 years before the statue's creation and 16 years before Graceland Cemetery was founded. His body was presumably relocated from its original resting place at the old City Cemetery (the present site of Lincoln Park). The will of Graves' son Henry, who died in 1907, provided $250,000 in funds for the monument and another $40,000 intended to commemorate Henry's favorite race horse, Ike Cook. The Cook monument was to stand alongside a drinking fountain for horses in Washington Park. The horse monument never materialized, despite the construction of a model; instead, in 1920, another Taft piece, Fountain of Time, was built in its place and features a hooded figure similar to the one in Eternal Silence.Ada Bartlett Taft's 1946 book Lorado Taft; Sculptor and Citizen lists Eternal Silence as one of the artist's most important works. Images of Eternal Silence have been used in other artworks, including those by Claes Oldenburg. One folktale claims that looking into the eyes of the statue's hooded figure causes the viewer to see a vision of his or her own death.\n\n\n== Design ==\n\nEternal Silence has been called \"eerie\", \"somber\", \"grim-looking\", \"mysterious\", and \"haunting\". The bronze figure, based on traditional depictions of the Grim Reaper, is set against a black granite base and stands 10 feet (3.0 m) tall upon that base. The black granite provides contrast for the bronze statue, which is heavily oxidized because of its age.  The cemetery used to shine the statue to return its true bronze patina but received many complaints and requests to return it to its more dramatic green sheen; the cemetery now keeps the statue in its preferred oxidized state.  The hooded figure was influenced by Taft's own \"ideas on death and silence\". Historically speaking, the figure in Eternal Silence is related to the sculpted funeral procession around the Tomb of Philip the Bold in Dijon, France and the Adams Memorial by Augustus Saint-Gaudens in Washington, D.C. The statue is considered famous and has been noted as Graceland Cemetery's most \"unforgettable\" monument. The monument was designed by Taft and cast by Jules Bercham. On its base, Taft inscribed the north side with his signature; the south side is inscribed with Am. Art Bronze Foundry J. Bercham -Chicago-. The monument falls within Art Nouveau style.\n\n\n== See also ==\nBlack Hawk Statue\nList of public art in Chicago\nThe Crusader\nFountain of Time\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\nKiefer, Charles D., Achilles, Rolf, and Vogel, Neil A. \"Graceland Cemetery\" (pdf), National Register of Historic Places Registration Form, HAARGIS Database, Illinois Historic Preservation Agency, June 18, 2000, accessed October 8, 2011.", "infobox": {"name": "Dexter Graves Monument", "nrhp_type": "cp", "nocat": "yes", "partof": "[[Graceland Cemetery]]", "partof_refnum": "00001628", "image": "Chicago, Illinois Eternal Silence1 crop.jpg", "caption": "According to folklore looking into the eyes of the statue will give the viewer a vision of their own death.", "location": "[[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]], [[Cook County, Illinois|Cook County]], [[Illinois]], United States", "locmapin": "Chicago#Illinois#USA", "built": "1909", "builder": "Jules Bercham", "architecture": "[[Art Nouveau]]", "customarchitect_title": "Sculptor", "customarchitect": "[[Lorado Taft]]", "added": "January 18, 2001"}, "wikidata": {"instance of (P31)": "sculpture (Q860861)", "architectural style (P149)": "Art Nouveau (Q34636)", "image (P18)": "Chicago, Illinois Eternal Silence1.jpg", "country (P17)": "United States of America (Q30)", "location (P276)": "Graceland Cemetery (Q4148426)", "located in the administrative territorial entity (P131)": "Chicago (Q1297)", "coordinate location (P625)": {"latitude": 41.955351, "longitude": -87.65967, "altitude": null, "precision": 0.0120795524115, "globe": "http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q2"}, "Atlas Obscura identifier (P7772)": "eternal-silence", "inception (P571)": "+1909-00-00T00:00:00Z", "Freebase ID (P646)": "/m/0h7qgr5"}, "cat": "Monuments_and_memorials", "url": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eternal_Silence_(sculpture)"}, {"name": "Confederate Park", "url_name": "15392499", "txt": "Demopolis Town Square, currently officially known as Confederate Park, is a historic park in the city of Demopolis, Alabama, United States.

The former church served as the Marengo County Courthouse from 1868 until 1871, when the county seat was temporarily moved from Linden. The park's center features a large cast iron fountain that was installed in 1895. The park is often used for the city's festivals, most notably for many of the Christmas on the River events.

He was elected to become a Senator in 1899, dying before taking the oath of office.\n\n\n== Life and career ==\nHayward was born in Willsboro, New York. He served during the Civil War in the Twenty-second Regiment, New York Volunteer Infantry, and in the Fifth Regiment, New York Volunteer Cavalry. He graduated from Fort Edward Collegiate Institute, New York, in 1865. Hayward then studied law in Whitewater, Wisconsin; he was admitted to the bar in 1867 and commenced practice in Nebraska City, Nebraska. He was a member of the state constitutional convention in 1873.  He became judge of the district court of Nebraska in 1886.\nHayward was elected as a Republican to the United States Senate on March 8, 1899, to fill the vacancy in the term beginning March 4, 1899.  This delay was caused by the failure of the Nebraska Legislature to elect a Senator by the start of the term. He did not take the Senate's oath of office before his death and was hence never officially a Senator, both because his health deteriorated after his election, and the Senate had adjourned. He died in Nebraska City, Nebraska on December 5, 1899, while in a coma. He was interred in Wyuka Cemetery.\nSources at the time noted that while he was a Republican, the Governor appointing his replacement, William A. Poynter was a Populist. He was hence replaced by Populist William V. Allen. The Courier wrote: \"Ethically as a republican senator was elected and has\ndied a republican should be appointed to take his place, but such transcendental politics is still unheard of in the year of our Lord eighteen hundred and ninety-nine.\"His son, Colonel William Hayward, commanded the 369th Infantry Regiment during the First World War, known as the Harlem Hellfighters.\nHis grandson was Broadway producer Leland Hayward, and the writer Brooke Hayward is his great-granddaughter.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of United States Congress members who died in office (1790\u20131899)\n\n\n== References ==\n\nU.S. Congress.

He founded the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan (Taliban) in 1994 and served as its first leader until his death in April 2013, including as the head of its government from 1996 to 2001. His death, however, remained concealed until July 2015, during which time the Taliban continued to issue statements in his name. Known for his reclusivity, he was (and remains) a mythical and revered figure within the Taliban.In the 1980s, Omar joined the Afghan mujahideen in their war against the Soviet Union and the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan. He lost his right eye in an explosion during the Soviet\u2013Afghan War. He founded the Taliban movement in 1994, and by 1995 had captured much of southern and western Afghanistan. After the Taliban seized the Afghan capital Kabul in September 1996, Omar was proclaimed the head of state of Afghanistan. During his tenure as Afghanistan's ruler, Omar seldom left the city of Kandahar, where he lived in a large house reportedly built for him by Osama bin Laden, the Saudi militant who was the founder of al-Qaeda.  Omar notably ordered the destruction of the Buddhas of Bamiyan in 2001. He became wanted by the United States government after being accused of harbouring Osama bin Laden and other al-Qaeda militants, who were responsible for the 9/11 attacks in the US.Following the 2001 US invasion of Afghanistan, Omar delegated all the operational control of the Taliban to his deputies, including Obaidullah Akhund. Omar fled from Kandahar to Zabul Province and his wives moved to Pakistan, but the Taliban continued to claim him as their leader, despite him taking almost no active role in the movement. Although the US put a $10million bounty on Omar\u2019s head, he hid within walking distance of US bases in Zabul Province. He lived as a virtual hermit there, refusing visits from his family. On rare occasions, he would communicate with the Taliban leadership based in Quetta, Pakistan. During the first four years of the Taliban insurgency, he lived in a secret room of a home in Qalat, Zabul. When the US Armed Forces began building Forward Operating Base Lagman just a few hundred meters from his hideout, he decided to move. He relocated to a shack in a riverside hamlet in Shinkay District, southeast of Qalat. Soon after, US forces started building another base, FOB Wolverine, just 3 miles (5 km) away from him, but he did not move this time. To avoid detection, he would occasionally hide in the underground irrigation channels connected to his new shelter. Omar died of illness on 23 April 2013 and was buried in a featureless grave but the Taliban kept his death secret for two years.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nDespite his political rank and his high status on the Rewards for Justice most wanted list, not much was publicly known about him. Omar made no public speeches and always refused to meet foreigners; Before his death, only one known photo existed of him. After his death, the Taliban released a newer and clearer photo showing Omar in his youth in 1978. Accounts of his physical appearance state that Omar was thin, strongly built and very tall, at around 2 m (6 ft 6 in). Omar was described as shy and non-talkative, like by the famed Afghan poet Abdul Bari Jahani, who visited him with academics and activists at the beginning of his rule, all applauding the system and security he brought, and remembers him as a \"tall and handsome\" man who \"listened in quiet.\" Zaeef said \"he listened, he was patient, and he did not react in anger.\" Conversely, a former Saudi intelligence chief who met him said Omar was \"extremely nervous, perspired, and even screamed at me.\" Senior Taliban leaders claimed he would \"stumble over his native tongue in the interviews he occasionally gave the BBC Pashto service.\" He had \"at least\" three wives and \"at least\" five or six children, including Mohammad Yaqoob, the current acting Defence Minister of Afghanistan.Omar studied at a religious school or madrasa run by his uncle. According to Gopal and Strick van Linschoten, all his religious education was in Afghan hujras, which are small religious schools annexed to village mosques. He completed his primary and secondary religious education, then began higher religious studies at 18. His studies were interrupted before he completed them and he did not properly earn the title \"Mullah\". Later in life he was given an honorary degree by the Jamia Uloom-ul-Islamia seminary in Karachi, Pakistan, but he never studied there, contrary to some reports. He was also given an honorary doctorate by Darul Uloom Haqqania in northwestern Pakistan, where numerous other senior Taliban leaders studied. Some sources have claimed that he studied there, but its leader Sami-ul-Haq said that he did not know of Omar until 1994. Despite receiving a personal invitation from King Fahd of Saudi Arabia in 1998, Omar refused to make a pilgrimage to Mecca and would not do one in his lifetime.In April 2015, during the time when his death was being kept secret, the Taliban published a biography of Omar to mark his \"19th year as their supreme leader,\" when in fact he had already died on 23 April 2013. According to this biography, Omar was born in 1960 at the village of Chah-i-Himmat in the Khakrez District of Kandahar Province, Afghanistan. However, according to The Daily Telegraph he was instead born in Uruzgan Province. He came from a line of Islamic scholars and teachers. His father was Mawlawi Ghulam Nabi, his grandfather Mawlawi Muhammad Rasool, and his great-grandfather Mawlawi Baz Muhammad. They were of the Tomzi clan of the Hotak tribe, which is part of the larger Ghilzai tribal confederation of the Pashtuns. His father, born in Khakrez District, was a poor, landless itinerant teacher who taught the Quran to village boys and received alms from their families. He died when Omar was three years old, according to Omar's own words, or five years old, according to the Taliban biography. Thereafter Omar was raised by his uncles. One of his father's brothers, Maulawi Muzafer, married Omar's widowed mother, as was often done in rural Afghanistan. The family moved to the village of Dehwanawark, several miles from the town of Deh Rawood, in the poor Deh Rawood District in Uruzgan Province, where the uncle was a religious teacher. According to former Afghan President Hamid Karzai, \"Omar's father was a local religious leader, but the family was poor and had absolutely no political links in Kandahar or Kabul. They were essentially lower middle class Afghans and were definitely not members of the elite.\"\n\n\n== Mujahideen era ==\n\nAfter the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979, Omar joined the mujahideen in Deh Rawood to fight the Soviets. In 1983 he moved with mujahideen friends to Maywand District in Kandahar Province and fought under Faizullah Akhundzada, the commander of a group affiliated with Harakat-i-Inqilab-i-Islami (Islamic and National Revolution Movement). Abdul Ghani Baradar was another from Deh Rawood who was in the group. Omar fought in the Maiwand, Zhari, Panjwai and Dand districts and was an expert in using rocket-propelled grenades against tanks. In the last years of the war, some mujahideen groups split up, and Omar and his friends left Faizullah Akhundzada's group. They formed a new group under Omar's leadership, based at Aday, in the Singesar area, then in the Panjwayi District and now in Zhari District, and became registered with Harakat-i-Inqilab-i-Islami as an affiliated group. Omar was wounded four times. Abdul Salam Zaeef has said he was present when exploding shrapnel destroyed Omar's right eye at Singesar during the 1987 Battle of Arghandab. Other sources place this event in 1986 or in the 1989 Battle of Jalalabad. Omar went to a hospital in Quetta, Pakistan, for treatment to his eye wound. According to former Taliban official Abdul Hai Mutmaen (or Mutma\u2019in), this was the only time that Omar ever went to Pakistan, and that he returned after treatment. According to Dutch journalist Bette Dam, in research published in 2019, he went to Pakistan on one other occasion during the war, to fetch weapons following a dispute within his mujahideen group. Mutmaen denies that Omar went there for weapons, but acknowledges that a few members of Omar's family claim he visited Pakistan four times during the war \u2013 once for the injury, then to register his group, and two visits to injured friends.The Soviets withdrew from Afghanistan in 1989. According to Ahmed Rashid, Omar joined the mujahideen group Hezb-i Islami Khalis and fought under the command of Nek Mohammed against Mohammad Najibullah's communist regime between 1989 and 1992.After Najibullah's government collapsed in 1992, Omar and a group of mujahideen turned their base near Haji Ibrahim Mosque in Gheshano village, in the Singesar area, into a madrassa. As well as teaching there, Omar resumed his own studies that had been interrupted by the war. Unlike many Afghan mujaheddin, Omar spoke Arabic. He was devoted to the lectures of Sheikh Abdullah Azzam.\n\n\n== Forming the Taliban ==\n\nAfter Najibullah's regime ended, the country fell into chaos as various mujahideen factions fought for control. According to one legend, Omar had a dream in 1994 in which a woman told him: \"We need your help; you must rise. You must end the chaos. Allah will help you.\" Omar started his movement with less than 50 armed madrassah students who were simply known as the Taliban (Pashtun for 'students'). His recruits came from madrassas located in Afghanistan and the Afghan refugee camps which were located across the border in Pakistan. They fought against the rampant corruption which had emerged during the civil war period and were initially welcomed by Afghans who were weary of warlord rule. Apparently, Omar became sickened by the abusive raping of children by warlords and turned against their authority in the mountainous country of Afghanistan from 1994 onwards.Two influential anti-Soviet political leaders who were connected with Peshawar during this era were Yunus Khalis and Mohammad Nabi Mohammadi; both exerted a considerable influence over the Taliban, particularly in the southern parts of the country, including Kandahar. Many of those who later formed the core of the Taliban, including Omar, fought under the command of factions that were loyal to Nabi Mohammadi. These factions had helped spread madrasa, attended by many of the Kandahar Taliban, throughout the southern regions of Afghanistan.The practice of bacha bazi by warlords was one of the key factors in Omar mobilizing the Taliban. Reportedly, in early 1994, Omar led 30 men armed with 16 rifles to free two young girls who had been kidnapped and raped by a warlord, hanging him from a tank gun barrel. Another instance arose when in 1994, a few months before the Taliban took control of Kandahar, two militia commanders confronted each other over a young boy whom they both wanted to sodomize. In the ensuing fight, Omar's group freed the boy; appeals soon flooded in for Omar to intercede in other disputes. His movement gained momentum through the year and he quickly gathered recruits from Islamic schools totaling 12,000 by the year's end with some Pakistani volunteers. By November 1994, Omar's movement managed to capture the whole of the Kandahar Province and then captured the Herat Province in September 1995. Some accounts estimated that by the spring of 1995 he had already taken 12 of the 31 provinces in Afghanistan.\n\n\n== Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan ==\n\n\n=== Leadership ===\n\nOn 4 April 1996, supporters of Omar bestowed the title Amir al-Mu'minin (\u0623\u0645\u064a\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0624\u0645\u0646\u064a\u0646, lit.\u2009'Commander of the Faithful') on him, after he donned a cloak which was alleged to be that of Muhammad, locked in a series of chests and held inside the Shrine of the Cloak (Kirka Sharif) in the city of Kandahar. Legend decreed that whoever could retrieve the cloak from the chest would be the great Leader of the Muslims, or the \"Amir al-Mu'minin\".In September 1996, Kabul fell to Omar and his followers. The civil war continued in the northeast corner of the country, near Tajikistan. In October 1997 the nation was named the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan and recognized by Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. Described as a \"reclusive, pious and frugal\" leader, Omar rarely left his residence in the city of Kandahar, and he only visited Kabul twice between 1996 and 2001 during his tenure as ruler of Afghanistan. In November 2001, during a radio interview with the BBC, Omar stated: \"All Taliban are moderate. There are two things: extremism ['ifraat', or doing something to excess] and conservatism ['tafreet', or doing something insufficiently]. So in that sense, we are all moderates \u2013 taking the middle path.\"Omar had a complicated relationship with Osama bin Laden. According to Pakistani journalist Rahimullah Yusufzai, Omar stated in the late 1990s, \"We have told Osama [Bin Laden] not to use Afghan soil to carry out political activities as it creates unnecessary confusion about Taliban objectives.\" Bin Laden was a challenge for Omar: he was widely seen as a defender of the faith, had deep pockets, and if he were to censure the Taliban, the movement would likely end. However, Omar did not want bin Laden spreading a message of jihad. Omar summoned bin Laden to meet him in 1996 after bin Laden's declaration of jihad against the United States the same year. He asked bin Laden to stop talking about the jihad, but as a matter of Pashtun tribal custom did not outright forbid him, as it would be deeply insulting to a guest. Bin Laden chose to ignore Omar. The high stature of Bin Laden and his importance in keeping the Taliban in power were further evidenced by Omar visiting bin Laden as a guest, a sign of deference and respect. After the 1998 United States embassy bombings, the US launched cruise missiles against al-Qaeda training camps and sought bin Laden. This inadvertently created more sympathy for bin Laden in Afghanistan. Omar did not hand bin Laden over, citing Pashtunwali tribal customs that require a host to protect guests, and that bin Laden was a guest of Afghanistan. Privately, Omar felt that if he bowed to the US by turning over bin Laden, the US would try to further influence Afghanistan and attempt to meddle in its religious matters. In 2000, Omar ordered bin Laden to not attack the United States, after advisors warned him that bin Laden might be planning to do so. Omar suggested to the US that bin Laden be turned over to an international Islamic court, or simply exiled, but the US turned both suggestions down.:\u200a47\u201350\u200aOmar was also \"Head of the Supreme Council of Afghanistan\". The Supreme Council was initially established at Kandahar in 1994.\n\n\n=== Bamiyan Buddhas ===\n\nIn July 1999, Mohammed Omar issued a decree in favor of the preservation of the Bamiyan Buddha statues. Because Afghanistan's Buddhist population no longer exists, so the statues are no longer worshiped, he added: \"The government considers the Bamiyan statues as an example of a potential major source of income for Afghanistan from international visitors. The Taliban states that Bamiyan shall not be destroyed but protected.\"In early 2000, local Taliban authorities asked for UN assistance to rebuild drainage ditches around tops of the alcoves where the Buddhas were set.In March 2001, the Bamiyan Buddha statues were destroyed by the Taliban under an edict issued from Omar, stating: \"all the statues around Afghanistan must be destroyed.\" This prompted an international outcry. Information and Culture Minister Qadratullah Jamal told Associated Press of a decision by 400 religious clerics from across Afghanistan declaring the Buddhist statues against the tenets of Islam. \"They came out with a consensus that the statues were against Islam,\" said Jamal. A statement issued by the Ministry of Religious Affairs of the Taliban regime justified the destruction as being in accordance with Islamic law. The then Taliban ambassador to Pakistan Abdul Salam Zaeef held that the destruction of the Buddhas was finally ordered by Abdul Wali, the Minister for the Propagation of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice.Omar explained why he ordered the statues to be destroyed in an interview:\n\nI did not want to destroy the Bamiyan Buddha. In fact, some foreigners came to me and said they would like to conduct the repair work of the Bamiyan Buddha that had been slightly damaged due to rains. This shocked me. I thought, these callous people have no regard for thousands of living human beings \u2013 the Afghans who are dying of hunger, but they are so concerned about non-living objects like the Buddha. This was extremely deplorable. That is why I ordered its destruction. Had they come for humanitarian work, I would have never ordered the Buddha's destruction.\n\n\n=== Opium production ===\n\nIn July 2000, Taliban leader Mohammed Omar, in an effort to eradicate heroin production in Afghanistan, declared that growing poppies was un-Islamic, resulting in one of the world's most successful anti-drug campaigns. The Taliban enforced a ban on poppy farming via threats, forced eradication, and public punishment of transgressors. The result was a 99% reduction in the area of opium poppy farming in Taliban-controlled areas, roughly three-quarters of the world's supply of heroin at the time. The ban was effective only briefly due to the deposition of the Taliban in 2001.\n\n\n=== Al-Qaeda 11 September 2001 attacks ===\n\nFollowing the September 11 attacks on the United States orchestrated by al-Qaeda, the United States under the Bush administration issued an ultimatum to Afghanistan to hand over Osama bin Laden and other high ranking al-Qaeda officials and shut down all al-Qaeda training camps within the country. In an interview with Voice of America, Omar was asked if he would give up Osama bin Laden. Omar replied, \"No. We cannot do that. If we did, it means we are not Muslims, that Islam is finished. If we were afraid of attack, we could have surrendered him the last time we were threatened.\" Omar explained his position to high-ranking Taliban officials:\n\nIslam says that when a Muslim asks for shelter, give the shelter and never hand him over to enemy. And our Afghan tradition says that, even if your enemy asks for shelter, forgive him and give him shelter. Osama has helped the jihad in Afghanistan, he was with us in bad days and I am not going to give him to anyone.\nOmar was adamant that bin Laden was innocent of planning the 9/11 attacks despite the accusations directed against him. Despite this, high ranking Taliban officials attempted to persuade Omar and made offers to the United States through its contacts with Pakistan. The Taliban ambassador to Pakistan Abdul Salam Zaeef said at a news conference in Islamabad that \"our position in this regard is that if the Americans have evidence, they should produce it.\" If they could prove their allegations, he said, \"we are ready for a trial of Osama bin Laden.\" The Taliban foreign minister Wakil Ahmed Muttawakil also attempted to negotiate, offering the Americans the proposal of setting up a three-nation court under the supervision of the Organisation of the Islamic Conference as it was a \"neutral organization\" or having bin Laden tried by an Islamic council in Afghanistan. Muttawakil said \"the US showed no interest in it.\" The Taliban Prime Minister Abdul Kabir stated that if evidence was provided, \"we would be ready to hand him over to a third country\". Part of the reluctance to hand bin Laden over stemmed from Omar's own miscalculations. Omar thought there was \"less than a 10 percent\" chance that the US would do anything beyond make threats.:\u200a65\u201366\u200aThe Supreme Council of the Islamic Clergy, a council of around 1,000 clerics, convened in Kabul in late September 2001 and issued a decree against the United States and its threats of militarily invading Afghanistan. They also recommended that Osama bin Laden be asked to leave Afghanistan of his own free will to \"avoid the current tumult\" and expressed sympathy and a conciliatory tone towards those who died in the 11 September attacks: \"The ulema voice their sadness over American deaths and hope America does not attack Afghanistan.\" The Taliban Education Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi said that Omar had agreed to follow guidance offered by the clerics and would try to encourage bin Laden to leave Afghanistan without forcibly handing him over to the United States for prosecution, even if bin Laden refused to leave the country.However, according to an interview with Pakistani journalist Rahimullah Yusufzai, Omar told him:\n\nI don't want to go down in history as someone who betrayed his guest. I am willing to give my life, my regime. Since we have given him refuge I cannot throw him out now.\n\n\n=== United States invasion of Afghanistan ===\n\nOn the night of 7\u20138 October 2001, shortly after the US-led United States invasion of Afghanistan began, Omar's house in Kandahar was bombed just after he had left, fatally injuring his 10-year-old son. His stepfather, who was also his uncle, was initially reported killed, but later reports said he was injured and treated in hospital.In another account of an attack that night, an MQ-1 Predator drone followed a three-vehicle convoy that left Omar's compound and drove to a compound to the southwest of Kandahar, with US commanders believing Omar was in one of the vehicles. Men disembarked from the vehicles and entered a large building in the compound. US military officers considered bombing the building, but were concerned that another building in the compound might be a mosque, which they wished to avoid hitting. Eventually it was decided to fire a Hellfire missile from the Predator at one of the vehicles, where armed guards kept gathering, in the hope that it would draw out anyone inside the possible mosque. The attack\u2009\u2014\u2009the first missile launched by a drone in combat\u2009\u2014\u2009appeared to cause two casualties. Dozens of men, some armed, emerged from the large building and other buildings in the compound, and some got into vehicles and departed.According to fellow Taliban fighters, Omar had secretly fled his residence in Kandahar for security purposes shortly after it was bombed and was last seen riding on the back of a motorcycle driven by his brother-in-law and right-hand man, Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar. Senior and former Taliban officials have said that there had not been any confirmed sightings of their Amir-ul-Momineen (commander of the faithful) in Afghanistan since then.\nIn November 2001, he was heard over a short-wave radio ordering all Taliban troops to abandon Kabul and take to the mountains, noting, \"defending the cities with front lines that can be targeted from the air will cause us terrible loss\". In a November 2001 BBC Pashto interview, Omar said, \"You (the BBC) and American puppet radios have created concern. But the current situation in Afghanistan is related to a bigger cause \u2013 that is the destruction of America. ... This is not a matter of weapons. We are hopeful for God's help. The real matter is the extinction of America. And, God willing, it [America] will fall to the ground.\" Claiming that the Americans had circulated \"propaganda\" that Omar had gone into hiding, Foreign Minister Wakil Ahmed Muttawakil stated that he would like to \"propose that Prime Minister Blair and President Bush take Kalashnikovs and come to a specified place where Omar will also appear to see who will run and who not\". He stated that Omar was merely changing locations due to security reasons.During the Battle for Kandahar in late November 2001, US Special Operations teams known as Texas 12 and Texas 17 aligned with Hamid Karzai and with Pashtun General Gul Agha Sherzai, respectively, surrounded Kandahar backed by US Marines outside LashkarGah. On 28 November 2001, while under attack by a Russian-made BM-21 multiple rocket launcher, Texas 17 observed Omar's black American-made Chevrolet Suburban passing Kandahar Airport and travelling down highway four surrounded by a dozen sedans and six semi-trucks. Four US Navy F-18's from USS Kitty Hawk destroyed all the vehicles including the Suburban. The same day, 28 November 2001, the Taliban reported that Omar had supposedly survived an American air strike.\n\n\n== Post-invasion ==\n\n\n=== Seclusion ===\nOn 5 December 2001, Omar held a meeting in Kandahar of top Taliban leaders and asked them what they wanted to do. Many were ready to stop fighting and willing to surrender. Omar handed over the Taliban leadership to his defence minister, Mullah Obaidullah, in writing. Two days later Omar left Kandahar and went into hiding in Zabul province in Afghanistan. In the following years, there was speculation about his location \u2013 with some believing that he went to Pakistan along with other Taliban leaders \u2013 and his circumstances and purported communications. But according to Bette Dam, in research published in 2019, and Borhan Osman, a senior analyst at International Crisis Group (ICG), Omar spent the rest of his life living in Zabul province. Dam said that her research relied on interviews with current and former members of the Afghan government, the Afghan intelligence agency National Directorate of Security, the Taliban, and Omar's bodyguard Jabbar Omari. She said that her findings, confirmed by Afghan officials as well as the Talibans, depicted the US intelligence failure and cast even further doubt on US claims in the Afghan war.Omar was protected in hiding by Jabbar Omari, a former Taliban governor of Baghlan province, who was from Zabul province and belonged to the Hotak tribe, as Omar did. They spent four years living in the provincial capital Qalat at a private home owned by Abdul Samad Ustaz, Omari's former driver. Omar's wives moved to Pakistan and Omar declined when Omari offered to bring his son to visit. He had very little active involvement in the Taliban from the end of 2001. He sent a cassette tape to the rest of the Taliban leadership in Quetta in 2003, reaffirming that Obaidullah was the supreme leader and naming who should be on the leadership shura (council). The shura sent a messenger every three to seven months, when they wanted his advice on some matter. He sent at least one other cassette tape, in 2007, but stopped that practice after the messenger was briefly detained in Pakistan, and thereafter messages were just relayed person-to-person. Omar kept in touch with events in the world by listening to BBC Pashto radio. Bette Dam wrote, \"Though Mullah Omar did not venture outside for fear of being caught, according to Jabbar Omari, in the four years they hid in that home, they felt relatively safe.\" The house was searched by the US military once, but they did not enter the concealed room where Omar was hiding.After the US established Forward Operating Base Lagman a few hundred metres from the house in 2004, Omar relocated to a shack in a remote hamlet on the edge of a river, about 20 miles southeast of Qalat in Shinkay District, close to the Durand Line. His hideout was connected to underground irrigation channels that ran up into the hills. Soon after moving there, the US started building Forward Operating Base (FOB) Wolverine an hour's walk or about three miles away, but Omar stayed put. The FOB eventually housed about 1,000 United States troops, and sometimes other NATO troops. To avoid detection, he would occasionally hide in the underground irrigation tunnels connected to his hideout, as US planes flew over or if US or Afghan troops came to search the area. People in the village knew that Taliban personnel were living there and offered gifts of clothes and food to Omari and Omar. In 2019, the Taliban released a picture of the supposed hideout where Omar spent the last years of his life. The pictures show a modest mud house with a small garden in which Omar \"used to sit in the sun\", according to a Taliban spokesman.Jabbar Omari said that Omar grew ill in 2013, refusing to visit a doctor and dying of illness on 23 April. Omari and two helpers buried him that night, with Omari videoing the burial as proof. Omari went to Quetta, returning with Omar's son Yaqoob and brother Abdul Manan Omari, who had not seen him since 2001. Yaqoob insisted that the grave be opened so that he could see his father. Omari went to Quetta and met with ten senior Taliban to describe the 12 years he spent with Omar. Obaidullah had died in 2010 and Akhtar Mansour was the operational leader of the Taliban. Four religious scholars at the meeting decided that Mansour should continue as leader, but that Omar's death and Mansour's succession should not be disclosed publicly yet, while the United States was preparing to withdraw from Afghanistan. Some at the meeting unsuccessfully argued for openness. Omar's death remained a secret for two years.\n\n\n=== Supposed activities ===\nSome believed that Omar hid for over a year in the mountains of southern Afghanistan before fleeing to neighboring Pakistan in late 2002. He continued to have the allegiance of prominent pro-Taliban military leaders in the region, including Jalaluddin Haqqani. According to sources, he was living for a time somewhere in Karachi, where he worked as a potato trader. The United States offered a reward of US$10 million for information leading to his capture.In April 2004, Omar was interviewed via phone by Pakistani journalist Mohammed Shehzad. During the interview, Omar claimed that Osama Bin Laden was alive and well, and that his last contact with Bin Laden was months before the interview. Omar declared that the Taliban were \"hunting Americans like pigs\".In the years following the allied invasion, numerous statements were released that were identified as coming from Omar. In June 2006, a statement regarding the death of Abu Musab al-Zarqawi in Iraq was released hailing al-Zarqawi as a martyr and claimed that the resistance movements in Afghanistan and Iraq \"will not be weakened\". Then, in December 2006, Omar reportedly issued a statement expressing confidence that foreign forces will be driven out of Afghanistan.In January 2007, it was reported that Omar made his \"first exchange with a journalist since going into hiding\" in 2001 with Muhammad Hanif via email and courier. In it he promised \"more Afghan War\", and said the over one hundred suicide bomb attacks in Afghanistan in the last year had been carried out by bombers acting on religious orders from the Taliban \u2013 \"the mujahedeen do not take any action without a fatwa.\" In April 2007, Omar issued another statement through an intermediary encouraging more suicide attacks.In November 2009, The Washington Times claimed that Omar, assisted by Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), had moved back to Karachi in October. In January 2010, Brigadier Amir Sultan Tarar, a retired officer with ISI who had previously trained Omar, said that he was ready to break with his al-Qaida allies to make peace in Afghanistan: \"The moment he gets control, the first target will be the al-Qaida people.\"In January 2011, The Washington Post, citing a report from the Eclipse Group, a privately operated intelligence network that may be contracted by the CIA, stated that Omar had a heart attack on 7 January 2011. According to the report, Pakistan's ISI rushed Omar to a hospital near Karachi where he was operated on, treated, and then released several days later. Pakistan's Ambassador to the US, stated that the report \"had no basis whatsoever\".On 23 May 2011, TOLO News in Afghanistan quoted unnamed sources as saying that Omar had been killed by ISI two days earlier. Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid responded, \"He is in Afghanistan safe and sound.\" On 20 July 2011, phone text messages from accounts used by Mujahid and fellow spokesman Qari Mohammed Yousuf announced Omar's death. Mujahid and Yousuf, however, quickly denied sending the messages and claimed that their mobile phones, websites, and e-mail accounts had been hacked, and they swore revenge on the telephone network providers. In 2012, it was revealed that an individual claiming to be Omar sent a letter to President Barack Obama in 2011, expressing slight interest in peace talks.On 31 May 2014, five senior Afghan detainees were released from the Guantanamo Bay detention camp in Cuba in return for the release of American prisoner of war Sergeant Bowe Bergdahl \u2013 a person claiming to be Omar reportedly hailed their release.In December 2014, acting Afghan intelligence chief Rahmatullah Nabil stated he was not sure \"whether Omar is alive or dead\". This came amid reports after the Afghan intelligence agency revealed fracturing within the Taliban movement, speculating that a leadership struggle had ensued and therefore that Omar had died. Later reports from Afghan intelligence in December said that Omar had been hiding in Karachi. An anonymous European intelligence official stated that \"there's a consensus among all three branches of the Afghan security forces that Omar is alive. Not only do they think he's alive, they say they have a good understanding of where exactly he is in Karachi.\"In April 2015, a man claiming to be Mullah Omar issued a fatwa declaring pledges of allegiance to the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIS) as forbidden in Islamic law. The man described ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi as a \"fake caliph\", and said \"Baghdadi just wanted to dominate what has so far been achieved by the real jihadists of Islam after three decades of jihad. A pledge of allegiance to him is 'haram'.\"\n\n\n=== Announcement of death ===\nOn 29 July 2015, Abdul Hassib Seddiqi, the spokesman for Afghanistan's National Directorate of Security, said \"officially\" that Mohammed Omar had died at a hospital in Karachi, Pakistan, in April 2013, and the office of Afghan President Ashraf Ghani confirmed that information on his death was \"credible\". Pakistani newspaper The Express Tribune reported that a former Taliban minister and current leadership council member, who spoke anonymously, said Omar died from tuberculosis.The following day, the Taliban confirmed that he was dead, but denied that he died in Pakistan. Other Taliban members stated that his death occurred in Afghanistan. According to an official statement by Pakistani defence minister Khawaja Asif, \"Mullah Omar neither died nor was buried in Pakistan and his sons' statements are on record to support this. Whether he died now or two years ago is another controversy which we do not wish to be a part of. He was neither in Karachi nor in Quetta.\"Afghan officials report that Omar was buried in Zabul province, a province in southern Afghanistan. Atta Mohammed Haqyar, head of Zabul's provincial council, believed that Omar was buried in a cemetery in Sarkhogan area of Shinkay district in Zabul province. Several senior Taliban commanders have also been buried in Sarkhogan area. He further stated that the area had special significance for the Hotak tribe which Omar was from.Sources close to the Taliban leadership said his deputy, Akhtar Mansoor, would replace him, although with the lesser title of Supreme Leader. It was confirmed by a senior Taliban member that Omar's death was kept a secret for two years.Fidai Mahaz, a Taliban splinter group, claimed that Omar did not die of natural causes; rather he was killed in his hideout in Zabul province.Many Islamist and jihadist movements expressed condolences following Omar's death, including Ajnad al-Kavkaz, Ansar Al-Furqan, Islamic Front's Ahrar al-Sham, Jaish Muhammad, Ansar al-Din Front, Turkistan Islamic Party, Jamaat Ansar al-Sunna, Jaish al Ummah, Jamaat-ul-Ahrar, Caucasus Emirate, Jaish al-Islam, Al-Nusra Front, AQAP, AQIM, and Al-Shabaab.Conversely, the Afghan government was unsympathetic to mourning his death; security forces were ordered to prevent citizens from publicly grieving Omar. A National Directorate of Security (NDS) spokesman said that Omar was \"the biggest cause of war and backwardness in the modern history of Afghanistan\", adding that any ceremony for Omar would be an \"insult\" to victims of the Taliban. Meanwhile, thousands of Afghans nationwide took part in rallies on 4 August, denouncing Omar.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nAggarwal, Neil Krishan (2016).

\u0412\u0435\u0440\u043e\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0430 \u0426\u0435\u043f\u043a\u0430\u043b\u043e) is a Belarusian political activist.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nTsepkalo's mother is Evgenia Shesterikova, sister is Natalya Leonyuk. Her grandfather Peter Shesterikov, was a writer, who has a street name in Mahilio\u016d named in his memory.In 1998 Tsepkalo graduated from the Faculty of International Relations of the Belarus State University with a degree in International Relations. In 2004-2006 she studied at the Higher School of Management and Business of the Belarusian State Economic University. In 2008, she studied at the National Institute of Small and Medium Enterprises in Hyderabad, India.Tsepkalo works as a business development manager for Microsoft.\n\n\n== 2020 election activism ==\nWhen Tsepkalo's husband Valery Tsepkalo announced his participation in the 2020 Belarusian presidential election, Tsepkalo accompanied him on his trips. On July 14, 2020, Valery was denied registration as a presidential candidate in Belarus. Soon after that, the headquarters of the opposition candidates united their campaigns - Svetlana Tikhanovskaya, Valery Tsepkalo, Viktor Babariko. Since the unification of these campaigns, Veronika became her husband's representative at the campaign rallies of Tikhanovskaya, while Valery and his children left the country fearing for their safety. In addition, throughout the campaign, Veronika was constantly under pressure from the government: from collecting information in the school where children study. Her sister Natalia Leonyuk was summoned to testify against Valery Tsepkalo.On July 30, 2020, during a rally in Minsk, Veronika spoke about the personal affairs of her family, and cited the falsification of a criminal case against her mother, who at that time was already in a serious medical condition. Fearing the loss of her freedom as a result of political persecution, she fled the country on the eve of the 2020 Belarusian presidential election, joining her husband in Moscow. She cast her vote at the Belarusian embassy in Moscow.Following the August 9 election where incumbent President Alexander Lukashenko declared victory amid allegations of fraud, Tsepkalo called on other countries to recognize Tikhanovsakaya as the legitimately elected president of Belarus.On 19 August 2020, it was reported that Tsepkalo was in Poland with her husband and children.On 8 September, it was reported that Tsepkalo was in Ukraine.\n\n\n== Awards and recognitions ==\nIn December 2020, Tsepkalo was named among the representatives of the Democratic Belarusian opposition, honored with the Sakharov Prize by the European Parliament.\n\n\n== References ==", "infobox": {"name": "Veranika Tsepkala", "image": "Veronika Tsepkalo.jpg", "native_name": "\u0412\u0435\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0456\u043a\u0430 \u0412\u0430\u043b\u0435\u0440\u2019\u0435\u045e\u043d\u0430 \u0426\u0430\u043f\u043a\u0430\u043b\u0430<br><small>\u0412\u0435\u0440\u043e\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0430 \u0412\u0430\u043b\u0435\u0440\u044c\u0435\u0432\u043d\u0430 \u0426\u0435\u043f\u043a\u0430\u043b\u043e</small>", "native_name_lang": "be, ru", "citizenship": "[[Belarus]]", "birth_place": "[[Mahilio\u016d]], [[Belarussian SSR]], [[Soviet Union]]", "alma_mater": "[[Belarus State Economic University]]", "occupation": "Business manager, political activist", "spouse": "[[Valery Tsepkalo]]", "children": "2"}, "wikidata": {"instance of (P31)": "human (Q5)", "sex or gender (P21)": "female (Q6581072)", "place of birth (P19)": "Mogilev (Q154835)", "educated at (P69)": ["BSU Faculty of International Relations (Q250063)", "Belarusian State Economic University (Q2628140)", "Belarusian State University (Q2418908)"], "languages spoken, written or signed (P1412)": "English (Q1860)", "spouse (P26)": "Valery Tsepkalo (Q3917390)", "country of citizenship (P27)": "Belarus (Q184)", "occupation (P106)": ["politician (Q82955)", "manager (Q2462658)"], "Commons category (P373)": "Veronica Tsepkalo", "LinkedIn personal profile ID (P6634)": "veronica-tsepkalo-961b1a82", "participant in (P1344)": "2020\u20132021 Belarusian protests (Q97384381)", "Instagram username (P2003)": "veronica.tsepkalo", "YouTube channel ID (P2397)": "UCyNQ-QygZYwUgXSUQwFtzmQ", "Facebook ID (P2013)": "veronica.tsepkalo", "name in native language (P1559)": "\u0412\u0435\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0456\u043a\u0430 \u0412\u0430\u043b\u0435\u0440\u2019\u0435\u045e\u043d\u0430 \u0426\u0430\u043f\u043a\u0430\u043b\u0430", "employer (P108)": "Microsoft (Q2283)", "award received (P166)": ["Sakharov Prize (Q48786)", "Charlemagne Prize (Q152337)"], "Google Knowledge Graph ID (P2671)": "/g/11jr16cpmh", "date of birth (P569)": "+1972-09-07T00:00:00Z", "Twitter username (P2002)": "VTsepkalo", "social media followers (P8687)": {"amount": "+64400", "unit": "1", "upperBound": "+64499", "lowerBound": "+64400"}, "image (P18)": "Veronika Tsepkalo.jpg", "GND ID (P227)": "1242942882", "VIAF ID (P214)": "1403163464512005680008", "IMDb ID (P345)": "nm11812706", "given name (P735)": "Veronika (Q18218258)"}, "cat": "Politicians", "url": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veronika_Tsepkalo"}, {"name": "The Lord Elwyn-Jones", "url_name": "654386", "txt": "Frederick Elwyn Jones, Baron Elwyn-Jones, CH, PC (24 October 1909 \u2013 4 December 1989), known as Elwyn Jones, was a Welsh barrister and Labour politician.\n\n\n== Background and education ==\nElwyn Jones was born in Llanelli, Carmarthenshire, and read History for a year at the University of Wales, Aberystwyth, and then at Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge. He spent time in Germany in the 1930s.\nAn acting bombardier in the Royal Artillery (Territorial Army), he was commissioned as a second lieutenant on 23 December 1939. He ended his service as a major.\n\n\n== Legal career ==\nHe became a barrister and Recorder of Merthyr Tydfil. He was also a broadcaster and journalist. He served as junior British Counsel during the Nuremberg Trials, and led for the prosecution (Leading Prosecutor) at the Hamburg trial of Marshal Erich von Manstein in 1948.\nIn 1966, he led the prosecution of the Moors murderers, Ian Brady and Myra Hindley.\n\n\n== Political career ==\nAt the 1945 general election, he was elected as Labour Member of Parliament for Plaistow, east London. In 1950, he became MP for West Ham South, serving until 1974. In 1964, Elwyn Jones was sworn of the Privy Council and appointed Attorney General (receiving the customary knighthood) by Harold Wilson, a post he held until 1970.\nIn February 1974, he was once again elected to Parliament, now for Newham South, but left the House of Commons soon afterwards when he was made a life peer, as Baron Elwyn-Jones, of Llanelli in the County of Carmarthen and of Newham in Greater London. The resulting by-election allowed Nigel Spearing to re-enter Parliament as he had lost the Acton seat in the February election. He served as Lord Chancellor from 1974 to 1979, under Harold Wilson and James Callaghan. In 1976 he was made a Companion of Honour.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nIn 1937, Elwyn Jones married Pearl \"Polly\" Binder, an artist from Manchester. The couple had three children: Josephine, Lou and Dan. Josephine became a researcher on Jacob Bronowski's TV series The Ascent of Man and married Francis Gladstone (a relative of Prime Minister William Gladstone). Dan is an artist, collector of children's playground songs and human rights campaigner.\nElwyn Jones's brother, Idris (1900\u20131971), was captain of the Wales rugby union team in 1925, and was an industrial chemist who became Director General of Research Development for the National Coal Board.Lord Elwyn-Jones died in December 1989, aged 80.\n\n\n== Arms ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n==

(Cyrillic: E\u043c\u0430\u043doi\u043b \u0411\u044a\u043bea\u043d\u0222 or \u0411\u044a\u043b\u0463\u043d\u0222; French: Emmanuel Balliano or Manuel de Balliano; Greek:

1794\u20131862), was a Wallachian statesman, soldier and industrialist who served as Caimacam (regent) in October 1858\u2013January 1859. Descending from an old family of boyars, he was one of two sons born to Ban Grigore III B\u0103leanu; the other, Nicolae, was a career bureaucrat, and the State Secretary of Wallachia in 1855\u20131856. Although prone to displays of Romanian nationalism, the family was prominent under the cosmopolitan Phanariotes, and young B\u0103leanu was educated in Greek. Prince Alexandros Soutzos welcomed him at the court and became his father-in-law. At that stage, B\u0103leanu's participation in the spoils system was signaled by his highly controversial claim to ownership of T\u00e2rgovi\u0219te city, and also by his monopoly on handkerchief manufacture. A slaveowner, he founded the village of Bolintin-Deal, initially populated by his captive Romanies.\nHis father hoped to steer the anti-Phanariote revolt of 1821, but both he and Emanoil were driven into exile when Bucharest fell to the rebels. In exile, B\u0103leanu Jr began gravitating toward liberalism, before becoming curious about utopian socialism. Under the Regulamentul Organic regime, he was made Polkovnik in the Wallachian military forces and served two terms in the Ordinary National Assembly. He and Ioan C\u00e2mpineanu emerged as leaders of the \"National Party\", which mounted the opposition to Alexandru II Ghica and uncovered constitutional irregularities. B\u0103leanu was sent into internal exile in 1841, but reinstated following interventions by his friends in the Russian Empire and the Wallachian Church. He ran in the princely election of 1842, but conceded defeat in favor of his friend Gheorghe Bibescu, who then made him his Postelnic (1843\u20131847). As such, B\u0103leanu contributed directly to the modernization of Wallachia, and also to the early stages of abolitionism\u2014though he himself remained a slaveowner to 1855.\nB\u0103leanu joined the conservative camp during the Wallachian Revolution of 1848. For a few days in June\u2013July of that year, he proclaimed himself Caimacam, heading a reactionary administration alongside Metropolitan Neofit II. Before being deposed and driven out of Wallachia, he gave the order to destroy revolutionary symbols, including the \"Statue of Liberty\". Returning with the Ottoman Army, he was again promoted under Prince Barbu Dimitrie \u0218tirbei, and especially during the late stages of the Crimean War, which removed Russian tutelage. His focus fell on obtaining a close alliance between Wallachia and the Austrian Empire.\nB\u0103leanu's second, internationally recognized, term as Caimacam was within a triumvirate that also included Ioan Filipescu-Vulpache and Ioan Manu; alongside the latter, B\u0103leanu instituted a repressive regime, directing censorship and intimidation against the National Party. They organized the legislative elections of 1859, but were outmaneuvered by liberals and nationalists, who managed to push through their agenda. B\u0103leanu was brutalized and shunned during events leading up to the establishment of the United Principalities, which put an end to his political career. His only literary work was a manuscript chronicle, which was later exposed as plagiarized.\n\n\n== Biography ==\n\n\n=== Early life ===\nThe B\u0103leanus, whose history is linked to an eponymous estate in D\u00e2mbovi\u021ba County, belonged to Wallachia's older lineage of boyar nobility, and claimed kinship with the ancient House of Basarab. The family patriarch was Udrea B\u0103leanu, who served as Ban of Oltenia in the 1590s. His nephew, Iva\u0219co I B\u0103leanu, emerged as a powerful player in 1630s Wallachia, having backed Matei Basarab for Wallachia's throne; his son, Gheorghe B\u0103leanu, similarly endorsed and fought alongside Constantin \u0218erban. He was prominent into the 1670s, when he and his family feuded with the Cantacuzinos; their conflict came to an end in 1679, when Gheorghe's son, Iva\u0219co II, was sent into exile. By the late 18th century, the family (one of the 16 boyar clans which could claim an ancient Wallachian origin) had secured major feudal privileges, including tax farming on their estates\u2014one of only four families to maintain that favor.Emanoil was Iva\u0219co II's great-great-grandson. He was born in 1793 or 1794 as the son of Ban Grigore III B\u0103leanu (1770\u20131842) and his wife Maria, n\u00e9e Br\u00e2ncoveanu (?\u20131837). On his mother's side, he was a collateral descendant of Wallachian Prince Constantin Br\u00e2ncoveanu; Maria's brother, also named Grigore, was the last male of the Craiove\u0219ti-Br\u00e2ncoveanu family. His maternal grandmother was a member of a Moldavian clan, the Sturdzas. Emanoil's siblings included a sister, Zoe (1791\u20131877). In 1811\u20131815, she was married to the aristocrat Matei Ghika, but divorced when he fell ill with tuberculosis. One contemporary account suggests that she then became the wife of Dimitri Caragea, a relative of Prince John Caradja. Zoe's last husband was entrepreneur \u0218tefan Hagi-Moscu. Zoe and Emanoil had a brother, Nicolae, as well as two other sisters: Elena, married to Constantin N\u0103sturel-Herescu; and Luxi\u021ba, whose husband was writer Nicolae V\u0103c\u0103rescu.Emanoil's childhood and youth coincided with the closing stages of the Phanariote era, during which Wallachia and Moldavia (the \"Danubian Principalities\") were more closely integrated with the Ottoman Empire, and Greek immigration became more significant. Father Grigore was involved with the Phanariote administration of Bucharest and owned houses just west of Turnul Col\u021bei. He was first propelled to the high office of Spatharios and Logothete during the Russo-Turkish War of 1806\u20131812, when he supported occupation by the Russian Empire, receiving the Order of Saint Anna. A patron of literature, he regularly donated from his collection of books, paid for a translation of Condillac's essays, and reportedly began writing a Romanian dictionary. In 1816, he sponsored Pete Efesiul's print shop\u2014Wallachia's first publisher of sheet music.Emanoil was home-schooled in the city by the Greek tutor Kirkireu, who introduced him to the Phanariote court. A contemporary note by journalist and editor Zaharia Carcalechi suggests that Emanoil and Nicolae B\u0103leanu were both educated in the Kingdom of France and the Austrian Empire\u2014though, as historian Nestor Camariano concluded in 1946, it is impossible to know when and for how long Emanoil was actually abroad. Although one late record suggests that he was also raised in Germany, Greek remained his favorite language of expression even later in life. At some point in his youth (probably before 1818), Emanoil produced a chronicle of documenting the history of Roman Dacia and the Early Middle Ages. The manuscript was much later exposed as plagiarized version of a similar work by Theodoros Photeinos (Teodor Fotino), which in turn may have copied a since-lost book by Dionisie Fotino. As noted by Camariano, \"nothing [else] remains, whether published or in manuscript\" from B\u0103leanu the writer.Historian Radu Crutzescu proposes that Emanoil's political rise was in large part owed to his kinship with two families: the V\u0103c\u0103rescus and the Soutzos; he was uncle of Mari\u021bica V\u0103c\u0103rescu, who was to become Prince Gheorghe Bibescu's wife, and, through his marriage with Catinca, son-in-law of Wallachia's last Phanariote Prince, Alexandros Soutzos. A Wallachian comedy of ca. 1820 shows Ban Grigore trafficking in influence to benefit his in-laws. Phanariote favoritism was also noted by memoirist Ion Ghica. He mentions that Emanoil's Greek education is what drew Prince Soutzos' attention. Upon his wedding to Catinca, B\u0103leanu received ownership of T\u00e2rgovi\u0219te, which the Prince had abusively claimed as his own; when news of this deal reached the sparked city, the rioting citizens placed a jinx on Soutzos' house. Catinca's dowry also included a monopoly on the manufacture of handkerchiefs, which came with additional tax privileges and the right to employ 30 foreign laborers. This included ownership of the textile mill at M\u0103rcu\u021ba Church, which B\u0103leanu immediately leased to a Russian immigrant.Emanoil B\u0103leanu first reached high office in 1819, when he served as Wallachia's junior Minister of Internal Affairs, or Vornic; he was the country's highest Logothete in 1821. Around 1800, he had begun constructing a manor for himself, at a new spot clear-cut from Vl\u0103siei Forest, between T\u00e2rgovi\u0219te and Bucharest. He and his family were traditional slaveowners, bringing with them a large number of captive Romanies; these were settled into a village that was originally named \"B\u0103leanu\". Around 1816, the completion of a road drew in Romanians from the neighboring Bolintin-Spiridon, which became depopulated. The resulting rural agglomeration functioned became Bolintin-Deal, which is still informally divided into Berceni and B\u0103leanu villages; both of them were populated by his tenant farmers, slaves and non-slaves alike.Catinca died in childbirth one year into their marriage, in what was seen by contemporaries as proof that B\u0103leanu was under the \"T\u00e2rgovi\u0219te jinx\". Despite his son's matrimonial arrangement with the Phanariotes, Grigore B\u0103leanu was one of the more independently minded boyars, who was made unassailable by his acceptance into a Janissary corps and his employment of a personal guard. Proud of his Romanian roots, and \"in touch with tradition\", he reportedly organized street parades that \"made Greeks quiver.\" Soutzos' death in January 1821 sparked a political crisis, making Wallachia into a theater for the Greek War of Independence. In parallel, there was an anti-Phanariote uprising in Oltenia, which Grigore may have personally have encouraged: he is alleged to have staged Soutzos' poisoning alongside members of the Filiki Eteria, after which he returned as Spatharios.\n\n\n=== Post-Phanariote period ===\n\nB\u0103leanu Sr is additionally cited as one of the boyars who reached out to the rebel leader, Tudor Vladimirescu, and invited him to act on their behalf. His son-in-law N\u0103sturel-Herescu joined the Eteria, and was consequently a soldier in the Sacred Band. The revolt was soon uncontrollable, and intrinsically anti-boyar in scope. The mill of M\u0103rcu\u021ba was looted and rendered inoperable. Escaping the threat of a full-blown civil war, the B\u0103leanus took refuge in the Austrian-held Principality of Transylvania, joining a colony of boyar expatriates in Corona (Bra\u0219ov). It was here that Emanoil was inducted into a secretive group of exiles, the \"Bra\u0219ov Society\", whose founding members included his father. He was subsequently initiated by the Freemasonry.On May 24, following a showdown between Vladimirescu's men and the Eteria, members of the latter called on Grigore to return and seize control of Wallachia. Later in 1821, the Ottoman Army invaded and restored the old regime; Nicolae B\u0103leanu, who had \"some part to play in the insurrection\", fled with the Eterists and made his way to Hermannstadt. Both B\u0103leanus signed their names to the letter demanding that the new Prince Grigore IV Ghica send them funds to ensure their safe return to Bucharest in 1822. Upon their return, Grigore B\u0103leanu Ghica as the country's Vornic. Nicolae and his Greek tutor Mavromati spent this interval in France, where the former was supposed to further his studies. Both were seen as dangerous suspects by agents of the S\u00fbret\u00e9.This period was ended by the war of 1828, which again saw both Principalities invaded by the Russian Empire. In 1829\u20131830, at the height of occupation, Emanoil B\u0103leanu joined the Special Committee for Reform, created by the Russians in order to confirm the constitutional principles that were to govern Wallachia and Moldavia. The committee, presided upon by Barbu Dimitrie \u0218tirbei, also included Iordache Filipescu, Alexandru Vilara, and \u0218tefan B\u0103l\u0103ceanu; it mounted resistance to Russian proposals for tax reforms, especially in opposing the notion that boyars could pay a direct tax. The Russians and Ottomans finally reached a compromise on joint rule over the principalities, and granted them a charter, Regulamentul Organic, which codified their fundamental laws. This document, produced in 1831, was partly co-written by Grigore B\u0103leanu and Iordache Filipescu.The throne in Bucharest was assigned to Alexandru II Ghica, who presided over an era of Westernization. Historian Bogdan Bucur notes that, under the Regulamentul regime and its \"bourgeois era\", the B\u0103leanus were the third most powerful clan of Wallachian boyars, ranking below the Filipescus and the Ghicas. In 1830, formally renouncing Ottoman clothing, Emanoil B\u0103leanu was integrated within the restored and modernized Wallachian military forces. He was one of the last boyars to be granted automatic advancement based on high birth, and almost immediately received the rank of Polkovnik (Colonel). He was first assigned command over the 1st Infantry Regiment at Craiova, serving under Russian commanders. His own subordinates included two future conservative polemicists, Grigore L\u0103custeanu and Dimitrie Papazoglu. B\u0103leanu was stationed in Bucharest in 1831, when Wallachia was hit by the second cholera pandemic. As reported by L\u0103custeanu, Russian overseer Pavel Kiselyov held B\u0103leanu and Ioan Odobescu responsible for the poor hygiene at Filantropia Hospital. Both were \"arrested inside the hospital\" and only released following its complete sanitation. According to L\u0103custeanu, they relied on take-out food and slept at a local pub.While his father was a sponsor of the conservative poet Grigore Alexandrescu, B\u0103leanu Jr was sympathetic to Wallachian liberalism, and welcomed in his home Teodor Diamant, who actively campaigned in favor of Fourierism. He consolidated his standing in 1831, taking over as Wallachia's Great Hatman; simultaneously, in the election of 1831 he acquired a seat in the Ordinary National Assembly. The Prince nominated him and Constantin B\u0103l\u0103ceanu to settle a long-running conflict between regular Wallachian Jews and their government-sanctioned leader, or Staroste. They failed to reach an understanding, simply reconfirming the Staroste to his position, where he remained for the next decade. Meanwhile, B\u0103leanu, Ioan C\u00e2mpineanu, Grigore Cantacuzino and Iancu Ruset presided over a liberal faction sometimes labeled as \"National Party\", and by 1834 produced designs on how to rewrite Regulamentul into a set of reformist policies. By then, B\u0103leanu had also helped set up a Philharmonic Society, which promoted culture along with liberal ideas.As a member of the Assembly, B\u0103leanu also reported on the status of Romani slaves. Mainly as a tactic for enlarging the state's fiscal revenues over a longer period, he proposed that government purchase and manumit slaves owned by the boyars. In order to provide funds for this initial effort, he instituted a custom whereby the Romanies, whether slaves or not, were to be assimilated with tenant farmers, and subjected to a poll tax; between 1833 and 1839, 185 slaves were emancipated using this system. The B\u0103leanus were otherwise still committed to the preservation of traditional institutions, including slavery. The family owned eight villages (four of which were in D\u00e2mbovi\u021ba), which in 1833 fetched them a total of 53,300 thaler in rents. In January 1837, Grigore sold off a family of Romanies to a Stavrache Iacov.In 1832, B\u0103leanu married Alina Bagration, daughter of a Russian officer and Bagratid descendant. She had a public affair with Kiselyov, and went with him to Russia in 1834. B\u0103leanu consented to a divorce in 1836, after which Alina moved in with Kiselyov and his wife Zofia Potocka. He held on to his Assembly seat following the 1836 election, which saw his father taking over as chief minister. According to Ion Ghica, the Nationals' \"four-man party\" controlled a majority of the Assembly seats, earning backing from Ilarion Gheorghiadis and other hierarchs of the Wallachian Church. As members of the Assembly, both Emanoil and Grigore supported the state religion and opposed attempts by the regime to infringe upon its liberties and privileges. From June of that year, B\u0103leanu Jr, C\u00e2mpineanu, Ruset and Alecu \"C\u0103ciul\u0103-Mare\" Ghica joined the Regulamentul revision committee. While researching the matter, they discovered that Russian officials had forged Regulamentul, tying to the original text an \"additional article\", which indicated that the legislation could not be modified by the Wallachians alone. Although the article remained in place and was recognized as valid by the Ottomans, the scandal was helped to consolidate Romanian nationalism and anti-Russian sentiment throughout Wallachia.\n\n\n=== 1842 election ===\nTravel notes left by the Frenchman Stanislas Bellanger suggest that the former Hatman attended subversive meetings with Xavier Vilacrosse and other expatriates, where they discussed founding a Wallachian magazine; Bellanger notes that B\u0103leanu wanted the publication to be non-political. By 1838, B\u0103leanu, C\u00e2mpineanu, Ruset and Costache Faca were members of the Assembly's financial board, questioning government's spending practices and attempting to draw more funds into education. In 1839, Prince Ghica appointed B\u0103leanu as his Minister of Justice, or Great Logothete, although he subsequently reassigned him to Internal Affairs, as Vornic. In July of that year, a commission comprising B\u0103leanu, Ioan Sl\u0103tineanu and Petrache Poenaru was sent by Ghica to inspect the Austrian\u2013Wallachian border on the Cerna, after numerous reports that Austria was violating the Treaty of Sistova. The Austrians snubbed them as negotiators, informing them that they would only settle border issue with imperial Ottoman envoys.B\u0103leanu soon joined the anti-Ghica faction, which by then included brothers Bibescu and \u0218tirbei among its leaders. Speaking at the closure of the Assembly in December, the monarch made disgruntled allusions to B\u0103leanu and C\u00e2mpineanu, claiming that both had lied in petitions they sent to foreign governments. However, in 1840, he appointed B\u0103leanu as one of the efori (caretakers) of Wallachia's schools, alongside Apostol Arsache, Ion Heliade R\u0103dulescu, and \"C\u0103ciul\u0103-Mare\"; he was also assigned to the appellate commercial court. On January 29, 1841, after noting his \"disrespectful statements\" in the Assembly, Prince Ghica ordered B\u0103leanu into internal exile. Sources give his place of banishment as Varni\u021ba or Bolintin. According to notes left by Jean Alexandre Vaillant, his ouster was part of a general clampdown on subversive activities, along with the imprisonment of conspirators Mitic\u0103 Filipescu and Andrey Deshov, and with Vaillant's own expulsion from Wallachia. By then, B\u0103leanu's Fourierist friends were also targets of repression: Diamant's Sc\u0103ieni Phalanstery had been forcefully closed, and his attempts to contact B\u0103leanu were thwarted.This clampdown proved to be a miscalculation of B\u0103leanu's support by Russian diplomats and Church officials alike: Metropolitan Neofit II and consul Iakov Dashkov pressured him to withdraw the order, which Prince Ghica did on February 3. B\u0103leanu remained the central figure of the opposition. In March 1841 he oversaw a ceremony for Kiselyov's retirement. Kiselyov was granted Wallachian citizenship on the occasion, prompting speculation that B\u0103leanu was grooming him for the princely throne. As reported at the time by Vaillant, B\u0103leanu conceived of the naturalization as a personal revenge against Bibescu. Returning as Logothete, he joined \"C\u0103ciul\u0103-Mare\", Sl\u0103tineanu, Vilara and Ioan Filipescu-Vulpache on the Commission which validated the Assembly elections of January 1841.\n\nDuring its final months, the Ghica regime still relied on support from the elder B\u0103leanu, who served as Vornic in June 1842. Following Ghica's ouster, B\u0103leanu Jr presented himself for the princely election, also serving as an elector; his father was also listed as \"fit to be Prince\", but died of coronary artery disease before the electors convened. B\u0103leanu Jr took most votes (79) in the third section. However, he redirected these toward his \"intimate friend\" Bibescu, who emerged as the winner. On June 29, 1843, B\u0103leanu entered the princely cabinet as State Secretary, or Postelnic. His office unified the attributes of a civil registrar, censor, and Foreign Minister. In this capacity, B\u0103leanu countersigned orders to expand and modernize the port of Br\u0103ila (August 1843) and protect insolvent farmers (June 1845), as well as publishing a firman confirming free trade between Wallachia and the Ottoman Empire (October 1843). His brother had by then established himself as one of Wallachia's leading textile manufacturers, using Austrian know-how to set up a modern factory in Tunari.During the election, B\u0103leanu had been favored by the French consul Adolphe Billecocq, who deeply disliked the \"Gypsy\" Bibescu. In 1844 the Postelnic dealt with the issue of French counterfeiters in Wallachia, which, despite Billecocq's protests, were slated for extradition and execution in the Ottoman Empire. From January 1845, B\u0103leanu was involved in the beautification of Bucharest, and sketched a project for building new roads between all Wallachian towns. In parallel, as members of the Extraordinary Administrative Council, B\u0103leanu, C\u00e2mpineanu, Filipescu-Vulpache, Vilara and Costache Ghica ruled in favor of dissolving the underdeveloped Saac Country, whose territory was split between the more prosperous Prahova and Buz\u0103u. Also in 1844, the Assembly appointed him, together with Vilara and Alecu Filipescu-Vulpea, to oversee the charity known as A\u0219ez\u0103mintele Br\u00e2ncovene\u0219ti. This had been set up for Bibescu's estranged wife Zoe Br\u00e2ncoveanu, whom the prince had declared insane, and who was B\u0103leanu's cousin.On April 19, 1845, B\u0103leanu married his third and last wife\u2014Elena (or Sultana), daughter of his colleague Constantin B\u0103l\u0103ceanu. In May of the following year, Bibescu took him to Ruschuk, where they paid homage to their sovereign, Sultan Abdulmejid I. Also that month, the Postelnic was accused by Billecocq of having failed to pay homages to Louis Philippe I on the feast day of Saint Philip. A review of this incident, published by Adev\u0115rul in 1893, suggests that B\u0103leanu was framed by Billecocq, who needed a diplomatic incident to conceal his own recall and disgrace. For a few days in September 1846, while Bibescu and Vilara inspected Oltenia, B\u0103leanu was effectively the leader of the country, and ad interim Minister of Justice. On February 11, 1847, Bibescu and B\u0103leanu urged the Assembly to debate on the issue of slavery. The result of this deliberation was a partial abolition, namely the release of all Romanies held captive by the Wallachian Church.B\u0103leanu helped Bibescu to dissolve the Assembly on March 11, 1847. Fifteen days later, he was involved in disaster relief following a devastating fire in Bucharest, overseeing the reallocation of funds. His own family home had been destroyed by flames. On March 31, he signed his name to the customs union between Wallachia and Moldavia. However, in the government reshuffle of May he lost the position of Secretary, which went to Constantin Filipescu; on May 11, he became an honorary Vornic, alongside Vilara. From August, he was again efor on the national school board. B\u0103leanu returned as Minister of Justice in December 1847, when he ordered a clampdown on frivolous litigators and the clarification of mulcts. By January 1848, he and Filipescu-Vulpache sat on a committee tasked with constructing a National Theater, but the entire project (supported by the Philharmonic Society) was shelved before taking off.\n\n\n=== 1848 Revolution ===\n\nInitially, B\u0103leanu and Bibescu were open toward the nationalist and liberal groups: by 1845, both had subscribed to Nicolae B\u0103lcescu's literary review, Magasin Istoric pentru Dacia. Within three years, the two camps had come to oppose each other openly. Early June 1848 witnessed the eruption of a Wallachia's liberal Revolution, which first limited Bibescu's authoritarian rule, then deposed him. After the abdication, the boyars assembled and elected B\u0103leanu as Caimacam, or co-regent, alongside Neofit and Ban Teodor V\u0103c\u0103rescu-Furtun\u0103; they were deposed after attempting to reverse the revolutionary trend.Later that month, generalized panic was created by rumors of a Russian incursion in Wallachia, and the revolutionary administration abandoned Bucharest for the more secluded town of Ruc\u0103r. On June 29, Neofit seized the opportunity and established another conservative government. B\u0103leanu became Caimacam, alongside Filipescu-Vulpache and V\u0103c\u0103rescu-Furtun\u0103. According to L\u0103custeanu, in public perception B\u0103leanu held the \"reins of government\"; his army colleague Odobescu was the Minister of War. During his short interval in power, he dismantled and destroyed revolutionary symbols. These famously included a Statue of Liberty, possibly by Constantin Daniel Rosenthal, but also a composition depicting \"free Romania\". B\u0103leanu also reinstated Bibescu's police force, including a Captain Costache Chioru, who reportedly shouted his intention to exercise a brutal revenge on the revolutionaries: \"I shall make myself a whip from the skins of Romanians\".This return to conservatism immediately upset the lower strata: on the night of the coup, a Petre C\u00e2rciumaru of Olari mahala reportedly threatened to kill Commissioner Ion Bidu; the following morning, a group of men from Delea Veche Street, flying a flag of their own making, stormed the neighboring area and threw stones into B\u0103leanu's townhouse. On July 3, the Bucharest bourgeoisie stormed into the army barracks, forcing the government to resign. The 40,000-strong crowd, led into battle by Ion Br\u0103tianu and Hieromonk Ambrozie \"Popa Tun\", won Odobescu's troops over to its side, without bloodshed. Neofit, captured by the crowds, declared that the previous coup had been instigated by B\u0103leanu and Iordache Zossima. This prompted the revolutionaries to vandalize B\u0103leanu's home and lynch as many of his partisans as they could find (part of a larger raid, which also resulted in the devastation of Zossima and Chioru's houses). The revolutionary gazette Pruncul Rom\u00e2n depicted B\u0103leanu himself as a vandal, calling attention to his earlier artistic purge. The incident was also noted by the far-left radical B\u0103lcescu, who insisted that government make its resolutions into permanent laws. According to B\u0103lcescu, B\u0103leanu was to be prevented from ever returning to Bucharest.By then the deposed Caimacam had again fled to Corona, joining a conservative faction in exile. It also included Sl\u0103tineanu, Scarlat Ghica, and Nicolae Su\u021bu. In September 1848, the Ottomans invaded and occupied Wallachia, which was again placed under a conservative regime. With Constantin Cantacuzino as Wallachia's new Caimacam, B\u0103leanu, Filipescu-Vulpea and Poenaru returned as efori, and staged a clampdown on revolutionary teachers. His brother Nicolae was appointed a Logothete, and served in the post-revolutionary administration of Bucharest. In October, he networked between the city guilds to ensure that the city and the Ottoman Army were properly supplied with bread.\u0218tirbei was afterwards crowned Prince, more fully restoring the Regulamentul regime. On August 24, 1850, he made Emanoil his Minister of the Interior, within a cabinet of \"relatives and intimate friends\". He also returned as chairman of the Assembly. Nevertheless, for several years after the Revolution's defeat, B\u0103leanu  failed to impose himself in political life: the newspaper Vestitorul Rom\u00e2nesc dismissed him as \"entirely unremarkable\". He had by then returned to his activities as an industrialist, with a new textile factory, which employed as many as 200 workers, opened in Dragomire\u0219ti. He stood out among conservatives for opposing all attempt at implementing land reform, and also for resisting the projected reductions of boyar privilege. B\u0103leanu also remained a slave-owner and, in May 1850, had a runaway Romani family returned to him by the authorities in Dolj County.The Regulamentul period ended during the Crimean War, which was a clash between the Principalities' Russian and Ottoman protectors. \u0218tirbei left Wallachia, without abdicating, in October 1853 and his cabinet continued to function. In April 1854, Spatharios N\u0103sturel-Herescu sought to integrate the Wallachian army into Halim Pasha's Ottoman troops; on August 23, Omar Pasha instituted martial law, and on August 31 set up a new government, headed by N\u0103sturel and Cantacuzino. By then, Austria had effectively occupied Wallachia, and the Ottoman presence was symbolic. In that context, Nicolae B\u0103leanu was involved in state-sponsored abolitionism, serving on a financial committee that also included Ioan Manu, and later as Chairman of the Wallachian Treasury.\n\n\n=== Triumvirate and downfall ===\n\u0218tirbei returned as an Austrian prot\u00e9g\u00e9 on September 23, creating himself a new cabinet, with Nicolae B\u0103leanu serving as State Secretary. After originally resigning in protest against \u0218tirbei's appointment, Emanoil returned as Interior Minister. On December 14, 1855, both brothers, alongside C\u00e2mpineanu, Filipescu-Vulpache, Alexandru Plagino and George Barbu \u0218tirbei, signed the decree which emancipated all of Wallachia's 200,000 slaves. Emanoil then oversaw the effort to count and register the newly freed Romanies. In early 1856, he rallied with anti-\u0218tirbeists boyars and signed a formal letter of protest. In order to win him over, on February 26 (New Style: March 9) the Prince appointed him Ban of Oltenia. As reported by the poet Alexandrescu, the ceremony ended in \"Homeric laughter\" when B\u0103leanu, overtaken with joy, sat down on the wrong side of the princely carriage.Meanwhile, Austrian occupation was giving way to a shared custody of Wallachia and Moldavia by a consortium of European powers, backing Ottoman suzerainty. Prince \u0218tirbei finally resigned on June 25, 1856: from Pite\u0219ti, he declared Secretary Nicolae B\u0103leanu as the highest authority in Wallachia. On July 4, he resigned in favor of his brother's enemy, Alexandru II Ghica, who took the title of Caimacam. Ghica turned increasingly liberal, and was regarded by his Austrian supervisors as \"almost child-like\"; the B\u0103leanus, meanwhile, endured as conservative leaders. That year, poet Dimitrie Bolintineanu characterized Emanoil as a figure out of Moli\u00e8re's comedies and an ultra-reactionary: \"he wishes to preserve all titles, honors, privileges, [and] has protection from Russia and Austria\". Overall, Bolintineanu contended, B\u0103leanu was a \"revolting nonentity\". While similarly noting B\u0103leanu's Austrian sympathies, Franz von Wimpffen cautioned that he was also lazy, unintelligent, and corrupt. With this platform and backing, B\u0103leanu ran in the September 1857 election and took a seat in the Assembly, which had been reconstructed and enlarged as an \"ad hoc Divan\".On October 21, 1858, Emanoil B\u0103leanu, Manu and Filipescu-Vulpache were formally appointed as Caimacami. The firman confirming this arrangement specified that B\u0103leanu oversaw Internal Affairs, while Vulpache was Logothete and Manu chaired the Divan. B\u0103leanu's return was especially controversial: he was now regarded as a leading adversary of the National Party, which sought to obtain a union between Wallachia and Moldavia. He and Manu clashed with the more liberal Vulpache as early as October 29, when they promoted their political friend Sl\u0103tineanu as Minister of Education. The two conservative Caimacami were in a position to control the new elections for the Divan, and were widely suspected of intending to manipulate results. Threats were posted on their townhouse gates, describing them as the \"bandit brothers\" and hinting at popular revenge. An incendiary device was reportedly thrown into Manu's home.In December, after the breakdown of negotiations between foreign diplomats, the issue of electoral fraud became an international scandal. Revelations had also emerged that the Caimacami had denied eligibility to some of the leading National-Party candidates, including Vasile Boerescu, Cezar Bolliac, and C. A. Rosetti. Such restrictions relied on different readings of the suffrage qualifications: while Manu and B\u0103leanu argued that candidates needed to own landed estates, Vulpache offered a dissenting opinion, with no restrictions for burghers or industrialists; this created a definitive schism within the regency, and pushed Vulpache closer to the National Party. Though they went back on some of their more controversial decisions, the other two Caimacami proceeded to govern by increasingly dictatorial means, suspending judicial independence, generalizing censorship, and ordering troops to mobilize in areas of the country that showed vocal support for unionism. The regency also restricted all forms of electoral propaganda.The elections doubled as a contest for the princely throne, with both Bibescu and \u0218tirbei entering the race. Although B\u0103leanu himself was a client of both former princes, he registered as a candidate, with his new title of Ban, also running against his father-in-law B\u0103l\u0103ceanu. On this second attempt, he was credited with minimal chances, being an \"unexpected\" contender. The elections produced unintended results for all of the conservative groups: backed by radicalized crowds numbering in the thousands, the National Party was able to pass resolutions in favor of union. A rallying speech by Vasile Boerescu, united unionist conservatives and radicals around Alexandru Ioan Cuza, who had already carried the Moldavian election, and against conservative separatists such as B\u0103leanu. During this process, the other deputies stripped B\u0103leanu, Manu, Ioan Hagiadi and Mihalache Ple\u0219oianu of their voting rights\u2014along with Alexandru Ghica and Radu Golescu, who opted to step down voluntarily. As reported by Alexandru G. Golescu, \"that swine Manu\" and \"that idiot B\u0103leanu\" had to leave the Divan's hall and were heckled and threatened as they returned to their homes. He also suggests that B\u0103leanu begged the crowd for forgiveness, but was merely derided.Eventually, the Divan elected Cuza, who was thus positioned to create the United Principalities\u2014initially as a personal union, with himself as Domnitor. B\u0103leanu left Wallachia during the union process, and in June 1858 had reached the Grand Duchy of Baden. His final will, completed in March 1861, suggest that he no longer held, or considered relevant, any of his father's houses in B\u0103leni; by 1873, these were in a state of advanced ruin. B\u0103leanu died in 1862, and was buried at Bolintin-Deal, whose main church he had dedicated himself in 1856. Ion Ghica was appointed executor, in which capacity he demanded a survey on the estates of Corbii and V\u00e2n\u0103torii; in 1866\u20131867, his land dispute with the local peasants led the latter to riot. Emanoil's widow Elena died in 1865. This was contrasted by the situation in Bolintin-Deal, where, before and during the 1864 land reform, the Romanians and Romanies alike had purchased 80% of the land they had been assigned for work. B\u0103leanu was also survived by his brother Nicolae (to 1868), by his sons Emanuel, who served in the Senate of Romania, and George; and by daughters Maria and Elena. His niece Zoe Hagi-Moscu (1819\u20131904) was the wife of politician Constantin N. Br\u0103iloiu.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==", "infobox": {"name": "Emanoil B\u0103leanu", "image": "Constantin Lecca - Emanoil B\u0103leanu.png", "caption": "B\u0103leanu as a ''[[Polkovnik]]''; 1831 drawing by [[Constantin Lecca]]", "succession": "''[[Caimacam]]'' ([[List of rulers of Wallachia|Regent of Wallachia]])", "reign1": "June 1848", "predecessor1": "[[Gheorghe Bibescu]]<br/>''(as Prince)''", "successor1": "[[Neofit II]]<br/>''(as Governor)''", "reign2": "June 29 \u2013 July 3, 1848", "predecessor2": "[[Neofit II]]<br/>''(as Governor)''", "successor2": "[[Christian Tell]]<br/>''(as Governor)''", "reign3": "October 21, 1858 \u2013 January 24, 1859<br/>''(with [[Ioan Al.

He led Philippine forces first against Spain in the Philippine Revolution (1896\u20131898), then in the Spanish\u2013American War (1898), and finally against the United States during the Philippine\u2013American War (1899\u20131901).\nAguinaldo remains a controversial figure in Filipino history. Though he has been recommended as a national hero of the Philippines, many have criticized him for the deaths of the revolutionary leader Andr\u00e9s Bonifacio and general Antonio Luna, as well as his sympathies for the Japanese Empire during their occupation of the Philippines in World War II.\n\n\n== Early life and career ==\n\nEmilio Aguinaldo y Famy was born on March 22, 1869 in Cavite el Viejo (present-day Kawit) in the province of Cavite to Carlos Aguinaldo y Jamir and Trinidad Famy y Villanueva, a couple that had eight children, the seventh of whom was Emilio Sr. The Aguinaldo family was quite well-to-do, as his father, Carlos Aguinaldo, was the community's appointed gobernadorcillo (municipal governor) in the Spanish colonial administration and his grandparents Eugenio Aguinaldo y Kajigas and Mar\u00eda Jamir y de los Santos. He studied at Colegio de San Juan de Letran but could not finish his studies because of an outbreak of cholera in 1882.\nHe became the \"Cabeza de Barangay\" in 1895 when the Maura Law called for the reorganization of local governments was enacted. At the age of 25, Aguinaldo became Cavite el Viejo's first gobernadorcillo capitan municipal (municipal governor-captain) while he was on a business trip in Mindoro.\n\n\n== Philippine Revolution ==\n\nOn January 1, 1895, Aguinaldo became a Freemason, joining Pilar Lodge No. 203, Imus, Cavite by the codename \"Colon\".\nOn March 7, 1895, Santiago Alvarez, whose father was a Capitan Municipal (Mayor) of Noveleta, encouraged Aguinaldo to join the \"Katipunan\", a secret organization led by Andr\u00e9s Bonifacio that was dedicated to the expulsion of the Spanish and the independence of the Philippines through armed force. Aguinaldo joined the organization and used the nom de guerre Magdalo in honor of Mary Magdalene. The local chapter of Katipunan in Cavite was established and named Sangguniang Magdalo, and Aguinaldo's cousin Baldomero Aguinaldo was appointed leader.The Katipunan-led Philippine Revolution against the Spanish began in the last week of August 1896 in San Juan del Monte (now part of Metro Manila). However, Aguinaldo and other Cavite rebels initially refused to join in the offensive for lack of arms. Bonifacio and other rebels were forced to resort to guerrilla warfare, but Aguinaldo and the Cavite rebels won major victories in carefully planned and well-timed set-piece battles  and temporarily drove the Spanish out of their area. On August 31, 1896, Aguinaldo started the assault by beginning as a skirmish to the full-blown revolt Kawit Revolt. He marched with his army of bolomen to the town center of Kawit. Prior to the battle, Aguinaldo strictly ordered his men not to kill anyone in his hometown. Upon his men's arrival at the town center, the guards, armed with Remingtons and unaware of the preceding events, were caught completely by surprise and surrendered immediately. The guns there were captured and armed by the Katipuneros, and the revolt was a major success for Aguinaldo and his men. Later that afternoon, they raised the Magdalo flag at the town hall to a large crowd of people from Kawit that had assembled after it heard of the city's liberation.\nThe Magdalo faction of the Katipunan, which also operated in Cavite under Gen. Emilio Aguinaldo, used flags similar to those used by the Magdiwang faction and featuring a white sun with a red baybayin symbol for Ka.\nThe symbol has recently been revived by a breakaway group of army officers to show the end of war with Spain after the peace agreement. The flag became the first official banner of the revolutionary forces and was blessed in a crowd celebrated at Imus. Aguinaldo referred to this flag in his proclamation of October 31, 1896: \"Filipino people!! The hour has arrived to shed blood for the conquest of our liberty. Assemble and follow the flag of the Revolution \u2013 it stands for Liberty, Equality and Fraternity.\"\n\n\n=== Battle of Imus ===\n\nIn August 1896, as coordinated attacks broke out and sparked the revolution beginning in Manila. Aguinaldo marched from Kawit with 600 men and launched a series of skirmishes at Imus that eventually ended in open hostilities against Spanish troops stationed there. On September 1, with the aid of Captain Jose Tagle of Imus, they laid siege against Imus to draw the Spanish out. A Spanish relief column commanded by Brigadier-General Ernesto de Aguirre had been dispatched from Manila to aid the beleaguered Spanish defenders of Imus. Supported only by 100 troops and by cavalry, Aguirre gave the impression that he had been sent out to suppress a minor disturbance. Aguinaldo and his men counterattacked but suffered heavy losses that almost cost his own life. Despite the success, Aguirre did not press the attack, felt the inadequacy of his troops, and hastened back to Manila to get reinforcements. During the lull in the fighting, Aguinaldo's troops reorganized and prepared for another Spanish attack. On September 3, Aguirre came back with a much larger force of 3,000 men. When Spanish troops arrived at the Isabel II Bridge, they were fired upon by the concealed rebels. The Spanish force was routed, withdrawing in disorder with substantial casualties. Among the abandoned Spanish weapons was Aguirre's sword, which was carried by Aguinaldo in future battles.\n\n\n=== Battles of Binakayan-Dalahican ===\n\nAlarmed by previous siege, led by General Aguinaldo in Imus, in September 1896, Governor-General Ram\u00f3n Blanco y Erenas ordered the 4th Battalion of Cazadores from Spain to aid him in quelling the rebellion in Cavite. On November 3, 1896, the battalion arrived carrying a squadron of 1,328 men and some 55 officers. Also, Blanco ordered about 8,000 men who recently came from Cuba and Spain to join in suppressing the rebellion. Prior to the land attacks, Spanish naval raids were conducted on the shores of Cavite, where cannons bombarded the revolutionary fortifications in Bacoor, Noveleta, Binakayan, and Cavite Viejo. The most fortified locations in Noveleta were the Dalahican and Dagatan shores, defended by Magdiwang soldiers commanded by General Santiago Alvarez, and the adjacent fishing village of Binakayan in Kawit was fortified by Magdalo under General Emilio Aguinaldo. Spanish naval operations were determined to crush the fortifications in these areas, mainly because the lake around Dalahican was strategic by connecting to the interior of Cavite. Apart from defending Binakayan, the Magdalo soldiers also kept the lower part of Dagatan up to Cavite's border near Morong Province (now Rizal Province). Between the towns of Binakayan and Dalahican, the Spanish forces lost decisively since the Filipino rebels, led by Aguinaldo and Alvarez, routed them back to Cavite City in which the remaining Spanish troops would eventually surrender. The successful defenses of Binakayan and Dalahican was considered to be the first major victory of the Filipinos over a colonial power.\n\n\n=== Battle of Zapote Bridge ===\n\nThe newly appointed governor-general Camilo de Polavieja was now fully aware that the main weight of the revolution was in Cavite and so decided to launch a two-pronged assault to defeat the revolutionaries, led by Aguinaldo. He ordered General Jos\u00e9 de Lachambre with a much bigger force to march against Silang to take on the Katipuneros from the rear, and he would engage the Filipinos head on. On February 13, 1897, Aguinaldo ordered soldiers to plant dynamite along the bridge and to place pointed bamboo sticks in the river beds below the bridge. Several hours later, 12,000 Spaniards began to cross the bridge. The trap was sprung, and the dynamite was detonated, which killed several Spanish troops and injured many more. The rebels then emerged from the bushes, fought hand to hand, and repelled consecutive waves of enemy troops charging across the river. Edilberto Evangelista was shot in the head and died. Cavite Province gradually emerged as the Revolution's hotbed, and the Aguinaldo-led Katipuneros had a string of victories there. After the battle, the demoralized Spanish soldiers retreated towards Muntinlupa.\n\n\n=== Spanish Cavite offensive and Battle of Perez Dasmari\u00f1as ===\n\nWhile Polavieja was poised to strike at Zapote, another Spanish contingent is marching towards Aguinaldo's rear. On February 15, 1897, the Spaniards launched the powerful Cavite offensive to drive and crush Filipino revolutionaries under Aguinaldo and his Magdalo forces that held numerous victories against the Spanish in the early stages of the revolution. Renewed and fully equipped with 100 cannons, 23,000 Spanish cazadores forces under Major General Jose de Lachambre saw town after town fall back to the Crown. Starting the offensive at Pamplona, Cavite, and Bayungyungan, Batangas, Lachambre's men later marched deep into the heart of Aguinaldo's home province.Having just won the Battle of Zapote Bridge, Aguinaldo turned his attention at the new Spanish threat and was determined to recapture most of Cavite. Aguinaldo decided to deploy his forces at Pasong Santol, a bottleneck of Perez Dasmari\u00f1as on the way to Imus, which rendered the Spanish immobile and served the revolutionaries by its natural defensive positions. On February 19, Silang fell to the Spanish juggernaut despite attempts by Filipino forces to defend and then to recover it. Nine days later, Spanish forces marched into Dasmari\u00f1as to reclaim the town. A week later, Spanish troops used artillery pieces well to attack again as they moved towards Aguinaldo's capital, Imus. Meanwhile, on March 22 at the Tejeros Convention, Aguinaldo was voted in absentia as president of the reorganized revolutionary government. Colonel Vicente Riego de Dios was sent by the assembly to fetch Aguinaldo, who was in Pasong Santol. Aguinaldo refused to come and Crispulo Aguinaldo, his older brother, was sent to talk to him. Crispulo greeted and talked to his brother and explained his purpose, but Aguinaldo was hesitant to leave his post because of the pending attack of the Spanish in Dasmari\u00f1as. Crispulo took over Aguinaldo's leadership in the battle, which had been stalemated since March 7, and Emilio traveled to San Francisco de Malabon (now Tanza, Cavite) to take his oath as president.\n\n\n=== Tejeros Convention ===\n\nConflict within the ranks of the Katipunan factions, specifically between the Magdalo and Magdiwang, led to the Imus assembly in Cavite Province, presided over by Bonifacio. The rebels of Cavite were rumored to have made overtures to establish a revolutionary government in place of the Katipunan. Though Bonifacio already considered the Katipunan to be a government, he acquiesced and presided over a convention held on March 22, 1897, in Tejeros, Cavite. Aguinaldo was elected president, even though he was occupied with military matters in Imus and not in attendance. Mariano Trias was elected as vice-president, Artemio Ricarte as captain-general, Emiliano Riego de Dios as the director of war, and Andres Bonifacio as director of the interior. The results were questioned by Daniel Tirona for Bonifacio's qualifications for that position. Bonifacio was insulted and declared, \"I, as chairman of this assembly, and as President of the Supreme Council of the Katipunan, as all of you do not deny, declare this assembly dissolved, and I annul all that has been approved and resolved.\" Regardless of the nullification, Aguinaldo and the others elected traveled to Tanza, Cavite, where they surreptitiously took their oaths of office.\n\n\n=== Biak-na-Bato and exile ===\n\nThe Spanish Army launched an attack that forced the revolutionary forces under Aguinaldo into a retreat. On June 24, 1897, Aguinaldo arrived at Biak-na-Bato, San Miguel, Bulacan, and established a headquarters there in what is now called \"Aguinaldo Cave\" in Biak-na-Bato National Park. In late October 1897, Aguinaldo convened an assembly of generals at Biak-na-Bato that decided to establish a constitutional republic. A constitution, patterned closely after the Cuban Constitution, was drawn up by Isabelo Artacho and Felix Ferrer and provided for the creation of a Supreme Council composed of a president, a vice president, a Secretary of War, and a Secretary of the Treasury. Aguinaldo was named president.\n\nIn March 1897, Fernando Primo de Rivera, 1st Marquis of Estella, the Spanish Governor-General of the Philippines, had been encouraging prominent Filipinos to contact Aguinaldo for a peaceful settlement of the conflict. On August 9, the Manila lawyer Pedro Paterno met with Aguinaldo at Biak-na-Bato with a proposal for peace based on reforms and amnesty. In succeeding months, Paterno conducted shuttle diplomacy, acting as an intermediary between de Rivera and Aguinaldo. On December 14\u201315, 1897, Aguinaldo signed the Pact of Biak-na-Bato under which Aguinaldo effectively agreed to end hostilities and to dissolve his government in exchange for amnesty and \"\u20b1800,000 (Mexican)\" (Aguinaldo's description of the $MXN800,000 amount) as an indemnity. The documents were signed on December 14\u201315, 1897. On December 23, Aguinaldo and other revolutionary officials departed for Hong Kong to enter voluntary exile. MXN$400,000, representing the first installment of the indemnity, was deposited into Hong Kong banks. In exile, Aguinaldo reorganized his revolutionary government into the \"Hong Kong Junta\" and enlarged it into the \"Supreme Council of the Nation\".\n\n\n=== Return to Philippines ===\n\nOn April 25, the Spanish\u2013American War began. The war mostly focused on Cuba, but the US Navy's Asiatic Squadron was in Hong Kong and, commanded by Commodore George Dewey, it sailed for the Philippines. On May 1, 1898, in the Battle of Manila Bay, the squadron engaged attacked and destroyed the Spanish Army and Navy's Pacific Squadron and proceeded to blockade Manila. Several days later, Dewey agreed to transport Aguinaldo from Hong Kong to the Philippines aboard the USS McCulloch, which left Hong Kong with Aguinaldo on May 16 and arrived in Cavite on May 19. Aguinaldo promptly resumed the command of revolutionary forces and besieged Manila.\n\n\n=== Dictatorial government and Battle of Alapan ===\n\nAguinaldo had brought with him the draft constitution of Mariano Ponce for the establishment of federal revolutionary republic upon his return to Manila, but on May 24, 1898, in Cavite, Aguinaldo issued a proclamation upon the advice of his war counselor Ambrosio Rianzares Bautista, and Aguinaldo assumed the command of all Philippine forces and established a dictatorial government with himself as titular dictator and power vested upon him to administer decrees promulgated under his sole responsibility. The dictatorial government was provisional in character until peace was established and unrestrained liberty attained. Dean Worcester wrote, \"although the title of 'president' was assumed by Aguinaldo, as more likely to be favourably considered in the United States than 'dictator', the tendency of his followers who had not been educated in Europe was to speak of and to regard him not as a president, but as an overlord holding all power in his hands.\"On May 28, 1898, Aguinaldo gathered a force of about 18,000 troops and fought against a small garrison of Spanish troops in Alapan, Imus, Cavite. The battle lasted from 10:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m. After the victory at Alapan, Aguinaldo unfurled the Philippine flag for the first time and hoisted it at the Teatro Cavite\u00f1o in Cavite Nuevo (present-day Cavite City) in front of Filipino revolutionaries and more than 300 captured Spanish troops. A group of American sailors of the US Asiatic Squadron also witnessed the unfurling. Flag Day is celebrated every May 28 to honor the battle.\n\n\n=== Declaration of independence and revolutionary government ===\n\nOn June 12, Aguinaldo promulgated the Philippine Declaration of Independence from Spain in his own mansion house in Cavite El Viejo, believing that declaration would inspire the Filipino people to eagerly rise against the Spaniards. On June 18, he issued a decree formally establishing his dictatorial government in which he also provided the organization of the local government and the establishment and the composition of the Revolutionary Congress.On June 23, Aguinaldo issued a decree replacing his dictatorial government with a revolutionary government with himself as president upon the recommendation of his adviser Apolinario Mabini. The decree defined the organization of the central government and the establishment and the election of delegates to the Revolutionary Congress and to prepare the shift from a revolutionary government to a republic.\n\n\n=== Arrival of Americans ===\n\nBy May 1898, Filipino troops had cleared Cavite of Spanish forces. In late June 1898, Aguinaldo, with the help of American allies, who were now landing in Cavite, was now preparing to drive the Spaniards out of Manila. The first contingent of American troops arrived in Cavite on June 30, the second under General Francis V. Greene on July 17, and the third under General Arthur MacArthur Jr on July 30. By then, 12,000 US troops had landed in the Philippines.Aguinaldo had presented surrender terms to Spanish Governor-General of the Philippines Basilio August\u00edn, who refused them initially since he believed that more Spanish troops would be sent to lift the siege. As the combined forces of Filipinos and Americans were closing in, August\u00edn realized that his position was hopeless, secretly continued to negotiate with Aguinaldo, and even offered \u20b11 million, but Aguinaldo refused. When the Spanish Cortes learned of August\u00edn's attempt to negotiate the surrender of his army to Filipinos under Aguinaldo, it was furious and relieved August\u00edn of his duties effective July 24. He was replaced by Fermin J\u00e1udenes. On June 16, warships departed Spain to lift the siege, but they altered course for Cuba where a Spanish fleet was imperiled by the US Navy.In August 1898, life in Intramuros, the walled center of Manila, had become unbearable, and the normal population of about 10,000 was now 70,000. Realizing that it was only a matter of time before the city fell and fearing vengeance and looting if the city fell to Filipino revolutionaries, J\u00e1udenes, suggested to Dewey, through the Belgian consul, \u00c9douard Andr\u00e9, for the city to be surrendered to the Americans after a short, \"mock\" battle. Dewey had initially rejected the suggestion because he lacked the troops to block Filipino revolutionary forces, which numbered 40 000, but when Merritt's troops became available, he sent a message to J\u00e1udenes, agreeing to the mock battle. A bloodless mock battle had been planned, but Spanish troops opened fire in a skirmish that left six Americans and forty-nine Spaniards dead after Filipino revolutionaries, thinking that the attack was genuine, joined advancing US troops. Besides the unplanned casualties, the battle went according to plan. The Spanish surrendered the city to the Americans, and it did not fall to the Filipino revolutionaries, who felt betrayed. By the end of September, Aguinaldo's forces had captured over 9,000 Spanish prisoners, who were relieved of their weapons. They were generally free to move around but remained within the control of Aguinaldo. Aguinaldo did not know that on December 10, 1898, the Treaty of Paris had been signed; it transferred the Philippines from Spain to the United States for the sum of $20 million.\n\n\n== First Philippine Republic ==\nThe First Philippine Republic was formally established with the proclamation of the Malolos Constitution on January 21, 1899, in Malolos, Bulacan and endured until capture of Emilio Aguinaldo by the American forces on March 23, 1901, in Palanan, Isabela, which effectively dissolved the First Republic. Aguinaldo wrote in Tarlac during the First Republic the Tagalog manuscript of his autobiographical work, which would later be translated by Felipe Buencamino into Spanish and released as Rese\u00f1a Veridica de la Revolucion Filipina (in English, True Account of the Philippine Revolution).\n\nOn August 12, 1898, American forces had captured Manila during the \"mock\" Battle of Manila and on August 14, 1898, established the United States Military Government of the Philippine Islands, with Major-General Wesley Merritt as the first American Military Governor. On the night of February 4, 1899, a Filipino was shot by an American sentry. That incident was considered to be the beginning of the Philippine\u2013American War, and culminated in the 1899 Battle of Manila between American and Filipino forces. Superior American technology drove Filipino troops away from the city, and Aguinaldo's government had to move from one place to another as the military situation escalated. At the Battle of Marilao River, Aguinaldo himself led his forces to prevent American crossings. The Americans gained superiority in the battle only after severe fighting and the use of gunboats in the river that \"made great execution\" of Filipino soldiers. On November 13, 1899, Aguinaldo disbanded the regular Filipino army and decreed that guerrilla warfare would now be the strategy. Aguinaldo led the resistance against the Americans but retreated to Northern Luzon.\n\n\n=== National cabinet ===\n\n\n=== Capture of Aguinaldo ===\nOn March 23, 1901, with the aid of Macabebe Scouts forces led by General Frederick Funston, Aguinaldo was captured in his headquarters in Palanan, Isabela. On April 19, 1901, Aguinaldo took an oath of allegiance to the United States, formally ending the First Republic and recognizing the sovereignty of the United States over the Philippines. After the capture of Aguinaldo, some Filipino commanders continued the insurrection. One of the forces was led by General Macario Sakay, who established the Tagalog Republic. On July 30, 1901, General Miguel Malvar issued a manifesto saying, \"Forward, without ever turning back.... All wars of independence have been obliged to suffer terrible tests!\"\n\n\n== Controversies ==\n\n\n=== Execution of Bonifacio brothers ===\nBonifacio refused to recognize the revolutionary government headed by Aguinaldo and reasserted his authority. He accused the Magdalo faction of treason and issued orders contravening orders issued by the Aguinaldo faction. In April 1897, Aguinaldo ordered the arrest and the execution of Bonifacio on some allegations implicating Bonifacio's involvement in some events at Indang. After the trials, Andr\u00e9s and his brother, Procopio, were ordered to be executed by firing squad under the command of Major Lazaro Macapagal on May 10, 1897, near Mount Nagpatong, Mount Buntis, Mount Pumutok, and Maragondon, Cavite. The facts that led to Bonifacio's execution remain questionable, Aguinaldo had originally opted to have the Bonifacio brothers exiled, rather than executed, but P\u00edo del Pilar and Mariano Noriel, both former supporters of Bonifacio, persuaded Aguinaldo to withdraw the order for the sake of preserving unity.\n\n\n=== Assassination of Luna ===\n\nAntonio Luna was a highly regarded general in the revolution who was sometimes at odds with Aguinaldo. On June 2, 1899, Luna received two telegrams (he failed to receive two others). One asked for help in launching a counterattack in San Fernando, Pampanga, and the other, sent by Aguinaldo himself, ordered him to go to the new capital at Cabanatuan, Nueva Ecija, to form a new cabinet. In his jubilation, Luna wrote to Arcadio Maxilom, military commander of Cebu, to stand firm in the war. Luna set off from Bayambang, first by train, then on horseback, and eventually in three carriages, to Nueva Ecija with 25 of his men.\n During the journey, two of the carriages broke down and so he proceeded with just one carriage with Colonel Francisco Rom\u00e1n and Captain Eduardo Rusca, having earlier shed his cavalry escort. On June 4, Luna sent a telegram to Aguinaldo to confirm his arrival. Upon arriving at Cabanatuan on June 5, Luna alone proceeded to the headquarters to communicate with the president. As he went up the stairs, he ran into two men: Felipe Buencamino, Minister of Foreign Affairs and a member of the Cabinet; and Captain Pedro Janolino. The commander of the Kawit Battalion, Janolino was an old enemy whom Luna had disarmed for insubordination, and once threatened with arrest for favoring American autonomy. General Luna was told that Aguinaldo had left for San Isidro in Nueva Ecija. (He had actually gone to Bamban, Tarlac.) Enraged, Luna asked why he had not been told that the meeting had been canceled.The general and the captain exchanged heated words as Luna was about to depart. In the plaza, a rifle shot rang out. Still outraged and furious, Luna rushed down the stairs and met Janolino, accompanied by some elements of the Kawit Battalion. Janolino swung his bolo at Luna, wounding him in the head. Janolino's men fired at Luna while others started stabbing him even as he tried to fire his revolver at one of his attackers. He staggered out into the plaza where Rom\u00e1n and Rusca were rushing to his aid, but as he lay dying, they too were set upon and shot, with Rom\u00e1n being killed and Rusca being severely wounded. Luna received more than 30 wounds and uttered \"Traitors! Assassins!\" He was hurriedly buried in the churchyard, and Aguinaldo relieved Luna's officers and men from the field, including General Venacio Concepci\u00f3n, whose headquarters in Angeles, Pampanga, Aguinaldo besieged the same day that Luna was assassinated.\nImmediately after Luna's death, confusion reigned on both sides. The Americans even thought that Luna had taken over to replace Aguinaldo. Luna's death was publicly declared only by June 8, and a circular providing details of the event released by June 13. Investigations were supposedly made concerning Luna's death, but not one person was convicted. Later, General Pantaleon Garc\u00eda said he who was verbally ordered by Aguinaldo to conduct the assassination of Luna at Cabanatuan. His sickness then prevented his participation in the assassination. Aguinaldo would be firm in his stand that he had nothing to do with the assassination of Luna.\n\n\n== American era ==\n\nDuring the American period, Aguinaldo largely retired from public life, though continued to support groups that advocated for immediate independence and helped veterans of the struggle. He organized the Asociaci\u00f3n de los Veteranos de la Revoluci\u00f3n (Association of Veterans of the Revolution) to secure pensions for its members and made arrangements for them to buy land by installments from the government.\nDisplaying the Philippine flag was declared illegal by the Sedition Act of 1907, but it was amended on October 30, 1919. Then, Aguinaldo transformed his home in Kawit into a monument to the flag, the revolution, and the Declaration of Independence. As of 2020, his home is known as the Aguinaldo Shrine.\n\n\n=== 1935 Philippine presidential election ===\n\nIn 1935, the Philippines became a commonwealth, and presidential elections were held as part of a ten-year transition to complete independence. Aguinaldo returned to public life, and ran for the presidency as the candidate of the National Socialist Party (no relation to the German Nazi Party) against the highly popular Nacionalista Party candidate Manuel L. Quezon, and Republican Party candidate Gregorio Aglipay. However, Aguinaldo's previous surrendering to the Americans in 1901 as well as his involvement in the deaths of Bonifacio and Luna had since made him an unpopular figure among the Filipino people, and he lost to Quezon in a landslide, gaining only 17.5% of the popular vote. \nDespite his decisive defeat, however, Aguinaldo refused to accept the results of the election, believing it to be rigged against him. In Cavite, the only province he had won, Aguinaldo's supporters plotted a rally in Manila to disrupt Quezon's inauguration and even assassinate him. However, this planned event was never actually carried out. Aguinaldo continued to criticize Quezon throughout the latter's presidency, expressing anti-semitic views when opposing Quezon's plan to shelter Jews fleeing from the Holocaust. The two men formally reconciled in 1941, when Quezon moved Flag Day to June 12 to commemorate the proclamation of Philippine independence.\n\n\n== World War II ==\n\n\n=== Collaboration with Japan and Second Republic ===\nOn December 8, 1941, the Imperial Japanese Army invaded the Philippines. The invasion came one day after the Attack on Pearl Harbor that had brought the United States into World War II. Aguinaldo, a longtime admirer of the Japanese Empire, sided with them, as he had previously supported groups that demanded the immediate independence of the Philippines, and entrusted that Japan would free the islands of American rule. In January 1942, Aguinaldo met with General Masami Maeda at the former's Cavite residence to discuss the creation of a pro-Japanese provisional government. On February 1, Aguinaldo delivered his infamous \u201cBataan Address\u201d, calling upon General Douglas MacArthur and all American and Filipino troops fighting in the Battle of Bataan to surrender to the Japanese Army.\n\nFollowing the retreat of American forces, Aguinaldo continued his collaboration with the Japanese. He was appointed as a member of both the provisional Council of State as well as the Preparatory Committee for Philippine Independence, which was tasked with creating a new constitution for a Japanese puppet state in the Philippines. Aguinaldo also played a key role in the Kenpeitai's campaign to suppress anti-Japanese resistance, urging guerilla fighters to lay down their arms and surrender to Japan. Aguinaldo was present at the inauguration ceremony of the Second Philippine Republic on October 14, 1943, raising the flag with Artemio Ricarte, who had returned to the Philippines from Japan at the request of Japanese Prime Minister Hideki Tojo. The Japanese had considered making Aguinaldo president of the republic, but he was ultimately passed up in favor of former Supreme Court justice Jose P. Laurel. Nonetheless, Aguinaldo was appointed as head of the National Distribution Corporation (NADISCO), placing him in charge of rationing prime commodities for the Japanese war effort.\n\n\n=== Capture, investigation and acquittal ===\nAfter US forces returned to the Philippines in October 1944, Aguinaldo went into hiding in order to avoid being captured and potentially killed. During the Battle of Manila, however, members of the Marking Guerrillas resistance force were able to track his whereabouts, and arrested him on February 8, 1945. Aguinaldo was then placed under house arrest as the US Army's Counterintelligence Corps investigated his collaboration with the Japanese. Despite his claims that he had secretly remained loyal to the US throughout the war, and that he, as well as other Axis collaborators, had only been forced to collaborate with Japan under great duress and should therefore all be granted amnesty, the People's Court of the Philippines nonetheless charged Aguinaldo with 11 counts of treason for his \u201cwholehearted\u201d support for and collaboration with the Empire of Japan.Aguinaldo was 77 when the US government recognized Philippine independence in the Treaty of Manila on July 4, 1946, in accordance with the Tydings\u2013McDuffie Act of 1934. On January 28, 1948, Philippine president Manuel Roxas granted amnesty to all Filipinos who had collaborated with the Empire of Japan, and as a result Aguinaldo's charges were dropped and his trial was never held.\n\n\n== Independence era ==\n\nIn 1950, President Elpidio Quirino appointed Aguinaldo as a member of the Philippine Council of State, where he served a full term. He returned to retirement soon afterward and dedicated his time and attention to veteran soldiers' \"interests and welfare.\"\nHe was made an honorary Doctor of Laws, Honoris Causa, by the University of the Philippines in 1953.\nOn May 12, 1962, President Diosdado Macapagal changed the celebration of Independence Day from July 4 to June 12 to honor Aguinaldo and the Revolution of 1898, rather than the establishment of the Insular Government of the Philippine Islands by the United States. Although now in poor health, Aguinaldo attended that year's Independence Day observances. On August 4, 1964, Republic Act No. 4166 officially proclaimed June 12 as the Philippine Independence Day and renamed the Fourth of July holiday to \"Philippine Republic Day\".\n\n\n== Death and legacy ==\n\n \n\nAguinaldo was rushed to Veterans Memorial Medical Center in Quezon City on October 5, 1962, under the care of Dr. Juana Blanco Fernandez, MD, where he stayed for 469 days until he died of coronary thrombosis at 94 on February 6, 1964, one month before his 95th birthday. A year before his death, he had donated his lot and mansion to the government. The property now serves as a shrine to \"perpetuate the spirit of the Revolution of 1896.\"In 1964, he published his book, Mga Gunita ng Himagsikan (Memoirs of the Revolution). A second publication was made in 1998 during the 100th anniversary of Philippine Independence.\nIn 1985, Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas issued a new 5-peso bill depicting a portrait of Aguinaldo on the obverse side. The reverse side features the declaration of the Philippine independence on June 12, 1898. Printing was discontinued in 1996, when it was replaced with a \u20b15.00 coin a year earlier (with the final printing year was stamped in 1995) with an obverse side featuring a profile of Aguinaldo. In 2017, Andres Bonifacio officially replaced Aguinaldo on the same coin.According to Larry M. Henares of the Manila Standard, a consensus had formed by the late 20th century that Aguinaldo was the greatest president in Philippine history for his executory role in the Philippine Revolution's victory against Spain and his struggle to maintain the nation's independence during the Philippine\u2013American War.\n\n\n== Honors ==\n: Quezon Service Cross \u2013 (June 12, 1956)\n: Philippine Legion of Honor, Chief Commander \u2013 (1957)\n: The Order of the Knights of Rizal, Knight Grand Cross of Rizal - KGCR. \n\n\n== Commemoration ==\nIn 1935, Camp Aguinaldo was established as a military headquarters of the Armed Forces of the Philippines and named after Aguinaldo.\nIn 1957, Emilio Aguinaldo College was established as a private, non-sectarian institute of education and named after Aguinaldo.\nIn 1965, President Diosdado Macapagal signed Republic Act No. 4346, which renamed the parish of Bailen, Cavite as General Emilio Aguinaldo.\nIn 1985, BRP General Emilio Aguinaldo was launched and became the lead ship of the General Emilio Aguinaldo class patrol vessel of the Philippine Navy.

\u0645\u0635\u0637\u0641\u0649 \u0627\u0628\u0646 \u0645\u062d\u064a\u064a \u0627\u0644\u062f\u064a\u0646 Mustafa ibn Mu\u1e25y al-d\u012bn), known as Emir Mustapha, Sidi Moustafa, Moustafa El Hassani El Djazairi, was an Algerian religious and military leader who led a struggle against the French colonial invasion in the mid-19th century with his brother, Emir Abdelkader.\n\n\n== Family ==\n\nMustapha was one of Mahieddine's sons and the younger brother of Emir Abdelkader. He married one of his cousins, with whom he had three sons and two daughters.In memory of his father, one of his sons was named Mahieddine, who married his cousin Zeyneb, the daughter of his uncle Emir Abdelkader.\n\n\n== French conquest ==\n\nMustapha strove to gain influence in the Emirate of Abdelkader and took an important part in the affairs of the Algerian country.\n\n\n== Sahara tribes ==\nIn 1836, Mustapha tried proclaim himself Sheikh of the Algerian Sahara tribe who had rallied to Abdelkader, but his attempt failed and he was struck with disgrace. However, he deeply apologised, so Abdelkader appointed him bey of Titteri in M\u00e9d\u00e9a.\n\n\n== Khalifa of M\u00e9d\u00e9a ==\n\nWhen Abdelkader laid siege to the city of Tlemcen in July 1836 to liberate it from General Louis-Eug\u00e8ne Cavaignac, he received news that some people had tried to rally the French and to rebel against him in M\u00e9d\u00e9a.Abdelkader let an auxiliary force continue the siege of the French garrison in Tlemcen, and advanced with dozens of cavaliers to M\u00e9d\u00e9a to stop the rebellion.Abdelkader wanted give land to his younger brother Mustafa, and in turn named him khalifa of M\u00e9d\u00e9a territory before returning to Tlemcen to continue the siege.Mustapha worked to submit Titteri and Mitidja to the power of the Emirate of Abdelkader before passing the title of Bey of Titteri to his successor, Mohamed Berkani.\n\n\n== Revolt of Kabylia ==\n\nOn May 8, 1837, Mustapha organized a surprise attack on a large agricultural farm in Regha\u00efa to force the French occupiers to sign a cease-fire treaty with Abdelkader.The farm, managed by settlers Mercier and Saussine, was positioned with its 3,000 hectares of area at the entrance of Kabylia which remained in sight of the sustained advance of French colonization towards the plains of Oued Isser.Mustapha urged the marabouts of the zawiyas of the Beni A\u00efcha, the Issers, and the Amraoua to terrorize the French settlers to stop the invasion of the mountain range of Khachna, which precedes Djurdjura.The first Kabyle attack on Regha\u00efa alarmed General Charles-Marie Denys de Damr\u00e9mont, who was the military governor of Algiers. He ordered General Alexandre Charles Perr\u00e9gaux and Colonel Maximilien Joseph Schauenburg to organize a punitive expedition against the Kabyles who sacked and looted the farm.Mustapha's goal was achieved, since the colonial troops, who were to quickly join Orania in order to contribute with General Bugeaud to the defeat of Abdelkader, were maintained and posted in Algiers in order to protect it and to organize the counter-offensive against the Emirate of Abdelkader.During the expedition of the Col des Beni A\u00efcha on May 17, 1837, the colonial forces lost because of bad weather, while the First Battle of Boudouaou on May 25 ended with the signing of the Treaty of Tafna on May 30.\n\n\n== Khalifa of M'Sila ==\n\nMustapha was later appointed in August 1839 by Abdelkader as Khalifa of the Hodna region around the M'Sila territory. As soon as he arrived in M'Sila, he headed for the Hautes Plaines in the northeast, calling all the tribes in his path to arms against the French, and in less than eight days, the insurrection became widespread.\n\n\n== Constantinois ==\nAt the beginning of 1840, Mustapha was commander-in-chief to the Algerian rebels that Abdelkader sent to the province of Constantine to harass the French troops.Mustapha carried out his mission in the Constantinois region and returned to temporarily live in Medjana before returning to the traveling capital of Abdelkader.\n\n\n== Ch\u00e2teau d'Amboise ==\n\nAfter Abdelkader surrendered in 1847, Mustapha accompanied him with the other members of his family to be exiled in the Ch\u00e2teau d'Amboise in France. Mustapha, along with all of his other brothers, left Amboise and settled in Morocco.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nFrench conquest of Algeria\nEmirate of Abdelkader\nFirst Raid on Regha\u00efa (8 May 1837)\nExpedition of the Col des Beni A\u00efcha (17 May 1837)\nFirst Battle of Boudouaou (25 May 1837)\nFirst Battle of the Issers (27 May 1837)\nTreaty of Tafna (30 May 1837)\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nArmand-Gabriel Rozey (1840).

He was arrested for drug trafficking in 2005 in the United States and jailed.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nBoron was born in Ghana on 19 February 1953. He had his secondary education at Nkoranza Anglican School in Nkoranza, where he passed his O-levels. He then attended Nkoranza Training College in Nkoranza for his A-level education, completing it in 1973. He then attended the Nkoranza Teacher Training College from where he qualified as a teacher. Years later, he attended the University of Ghana, obtaining a diploma in religion in 1992.\n\n\n== Career ==\nAmoateng initially worked as a teacher. He then worked as marketing manager for the Koajay company, that bought and distributed school supplies.\nAmoateng was also the chief (king) of Amoma, a town in the Kintampo South District of the Brong Ahafo Region, with the title Nana Amoateng Ameyaw II. He is said to have spent lavishly on his people and earned a reputation for philanthropy.\n\n\n== Politics ==\nAmoateng unsuccessfully bid to stand as the New Patriotic Party (NPP) candidate for the Nkoranza constituency in 2000 amidst some controversy. Some were reportedly wary of his affluence. It was also reported that, in 2001, Amoateng was accused of visa fraud.Amoateng renounced his chieftaincy in 2004 in order to stand in the December 2004 parliamentary elections on the ticket of the NPP, adopting Bomini in the neighbouring Nkoranza North constituency in the Nkoranza District of the Brong Ahafo region of Ghana, as his home town. His candidacy for the Nkoranza North constituency was challenged at the Sunyani High Court in 2004, but the case was eventually withdrawn. He won 46.9 per cent of the votes with a margin of 22.3 per cent to become the first ever Member of Parliament for the newly created Nkoranza North constituency, from 7 January 2005.\n\n\n== Elections ==\nAmoateng was elected as the member of parliament for the Nkoranza North in the 2004 Ghanaian general elections. He thus represented the constituency in the 4th parliament of the 4th republic of Ghana. He was elected with 9,144 votes out of 18,900 valid votes cast. This was equivalent to 48.40% of total valid votes cast. He was elected over Hayford Francis Amoako of the National Democratic Congress and Kwame Ofosu Adjei Prince an independent candidate. These obtained 5,402 and 4,354 votes respectively. These were equivalent to 28.60% and 23.00% respectively of total valid votes cast. Amoateng was elected on the ticket of the New Patriotic Party. The New Patriotic Party won 14 parliamentary seats out of the total 24 seats for the Brong Ahafo region. In that election of 2004, the party won a majority total of 128 parliamentary seats out of a total 230 parliamentary seats.\n\n\n== Arrest, trial and jail ==\nAmoateng was arrested in the United States of America on 12 November 2005. He had travelled to the USA on an Emirates Airline flight to the John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK) with a friend, Nii Okai Adjei. The trip was ostensibly to buy wrist watches for resale in Ghana with US$9,000 seized from Amoateng. Seven boxes of pottery which had landed at Newark Liberty International Airport from London, destined for JFK a day earlier, were found to contain 136 pounds of heroin. The reported street value of the drugs was about US$6 million. Amoateng and Adjei were monitored by security personnel as they took delivery of the cargo and sent it to a self-storage location on Staten Island. They were arrested the next day when they went to inspect the goods. Amoateng unsuccessfully claimed diplomatic immunity following his arrest. They were charged with \"conspiracy with intent to distribute heroin\".Amoateng and Adjei initially pleaded not guilty to the charge of conspiracy to distribute narcotics when brought to court. Adjei later changed his plea to guilty. Following this, a second charge was brought against Amoateng. In August 2006, a third charge of \"distributing a controlled narcotic substance of about a kilogram or more containing heroin\" was brought against Amoateng.On 19 March, 2007, Amoateng changed his plea to guilty. He was sentenced on 12 December 2007 to ten years in jail. He served his sentence at the Moshannon Valley Correctional Center in Pennsylvania, United States.\n\n\n== Fallout from arrest ==\n\n\n=== Parliament ===\nFollowing his arrest, there was a long debate as to whether Amoateng should remain MP for Nkoranza North. Kyei-Mensah-Bonsu, Majority Chief Whip, maintained that \"until the case is disposed off he remains a suspect and that the allegation would have to be substantiated\". While the majority leader in parliament announced that the government would hold the fort for the MP, the opposition insisted that a by-election be held to replace him. This went on for more than ten months. One of his sons, Augustine Akwasi Amoateng, defended his father's innocence in April 2006. Amoateng eventually sent a letter of resignation around May 2006 to parliament but this was rejected on procedural grounds. The Speaker of Parliament, Ebenezer Sekyi-Hughes, directed on 30 January 2007, that the question of Amoateng's long absence from parliament be revisited. However, he sent a resignation letter dated 4 February 2007, to the Speaker of the Parliament of Ghana which was accepted.By-elections to replace Amoateng were finally held on 13 March 2007, 16 months after his arrest. The seat was won by Derek Oduro, a retired army major, who was sworn in on 21 March 2007.\n\n\n=== Investigations within Ghana ===\nInvestigations instituted within Ghana in order to possibly seize assets obtained through drugs appear to have fizzled out. The Narcotic Controls Board (NACOB) had identified assets of Amoateng's accomplice, Nii Okai Adjei but were unable to pursue the assets of Amoateng possibly due to interference by officials of the NPP government. NACOB indicated its intention to reopen investigations when Amoateng returns to Ghana. He was arrested for questioning by NACOB on his arrival in Ghana on 7 August 2014, at the Kotoka International Airport. He was detained at the Nima Police Station for four days until he could satisfy conditions of bail set by an Accra Circuit Court.Amoateng also faced trial for possessing fake travel documents on his return. His Ghanaian passport with number H2347080 which was issued in February 2009 while he was still in jail, was the same as that issued by the Ghanaian immigration authorities to a woman. He was, however, acquitted because, although the prosecution was convinced the passport was fraudulently acquired, the High Court said the prosecution failed to prove that Amoateng was aware that his passport was forged. In 2017, 12 years after his arrest and three years after his release from jail, NACOB stated they were unable to confiscate his assets as they still do not have the details of his judgement from the United States.\n\n\n== Trivia ==\nOn 13 February 2006, the Nkoranza constituency branch chairman of the NPP commended the volunteers who worked on Amoateng's 300 hectare maize farm in his absence.\nOn 24 March 2006, a rally was held in his support by the people of Busunya attended by NPP delegates. Some placards at the rally read \"Cocaine or No Cocaine Amoateng Is Still Our MP\".\nIn April 2007, the chiefs and people of Busunya in the Nkoranza district named a street after Amoateng for his \"contribution to the socio-economic development of the area\". He is also reported to have  helped to \"finance the construction of eight streets and drainage systems in the town which is the constituency capital\".\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nDOSSIER: Missing MP", "infobox": {"honorific-prefix": "Hon.", "name": "Eric Amoateng", "constituency_MP": "Nkoranza North Constituency", "parliament": "Ghana", "term_start": "7 January 2005", "term_end": "6 January 2009", "president": "[[John Kufuor]]", "predecessor": "''New constituency''", "successor": "Derek Oduro", "birth_date": "{{Birth date and age|1953|2|19|df|=|y}}", "nationality": "[[Ghanaian nationality law|Ghanaian]]", "party": "[[New Patriotic Party]]", "alma_mater": "[[University of Ghana]]", "profession": "Teacher"}, "wikidata": {"member of political party (P102)": "New Patriotic Party (Q1148441)", "educated at (P69)": "University of Ghana (Q2303765)", "instance of (P31)": "human (Q5)", "date of birth (P569)": "+1953-02-19T00:00:00Z", "sex or gender (P21)": "male (Q6581097)", "given name (P735)": "Eric (Q12788459)", "occupation (P106)": ["politician (Q82955)", "teacher (Q37226)"], "country of citizenship (P27)": "Ghana (Q117)", "place of birth (P19)": "Ghana (Q117)", "position held (P39)": "Member of the 4th Parliament of the 4th Republic of Ghana (Q96657427)", "family name (P734)": "Amoateng (Q37331034)", "religion or worldview (P140)": "Christianity (Q5043)", "Freebase ID (P646)": "/m/02qrq4f", "languages spoken, written or signed (P1412)": "English (Q1860)", "OpenSanctions ID (P10632)": "Eric Amoateng (Q5386016)"}, "cat": "Politicians", "url": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Amoateng"}, {"name": "Sport Club Municipal Craiova", "url_name": "28382486", "txt": "SCM Craiova is a Romanian sports society from Craiova, Romania, founded in 2006.

It entered the Persha Liha as a replacement for the bankrupt club FC Hazovyk-Skala Stryi, which also represented Lviv Oblast. The new entity was registered on 22 May 2006 as a company with limited liability (Ukrainian: \u0422\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e \u0437 \u043e\u0431\u043c\u0435\u0436\u0435\u043d\u043e\u044e \u0432\u0456\u0434\u043f\u043e\u0432\u0456\u0434\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0456\u0441\u0442\u044e) \"Football Club \"Lviv\". Later in May 2006 the PFL Bureau session adopted a decision to recognize the club as a lawful successor (Ukrainian: \u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043e\u043d\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0443\u043f\u043d\u0438\u043a) of FC Hazovyk-Skala Stryi that played in Persha Liha. This fact was also confirmed at a press-conference given at the Football Federation of Lviv Oblast on 26 May 2006. The new president of the new club Yuriy Kindzerskyi informed that his club was not created as a municipal club.In its debut season FC Lviv reached 11th place and scored 45 goals. At the start of the next season, in the beginning of September 2007, the club moved to the newly built stadium Kniazha Arena in Dobromyl, west of Sambir. This arena was constructed by and named after Ukrainian insurance company Knyazha, who is the club's main sponsor. The previous home ground of the club was SKA Stadium in Lviv which fell out of favor with the FFU, PFL.\nIn 2007\u201308 season FC Lviv finished 2nd in the Persha Liha and were promoted to the Premier Liha for the first time in their history, making the club one of the founders of the newly formed Premier League. In 2008\u201309 FC Lviv, despite a sensational opening 2\u20130 win against Shakhtar, were relegated to the Persha Liha. The decisive match for them happened in the last round against another Lviv team Karpaty in the Lviv derby when they lost 2\u20131. The club's first, and only, season in the Premier League was spent at The Ukraina Stadium together with Karpaty under a lease contract.\nIn 2009, the city of Lviv lent the former land property of LORTA Plant for rent to FC Lviv. Out of 3.0542 ha FC Lviv receives 2.9 ha in rent until the spring of 2019 and the rest for only five years.\n\n\n=== FC Lviv (since 2016) ===\nIn 2016 the professional team of FC Lviv was renewed and its future participation in Druha Liha was announced.In May 2018, the club was promoted to the Ukrainian Premier League on pretence of merging with NK Veres Rivne and play in the 2018\u201319 Ukrainian Premier League.\nAt its official website, the club tells that all efforts of NK Veres Rivne are actually efforts of FC Lviv instead. The club states that it was FC Lviv that placed 6th in the 2017\u201318 Ukrainian Premier League, while the same claim for this achievement is laid by Veres Rivne. Records however clearly show that at that time FC Lviv played in the 2017\u201318 Ukrainian Second League and recovered their professional status only in 2017. This claim is particularly bold as in 2017 NK Veres Rivne as a \"people's club\" had a big scandal with its promotion ahead of FC Desna Chernihiv.\n\n\n== Players ==\nAs of 8 April 2022\n\n\n=== Team squad ===\nNote: Flags indicate national team as defined under FIFA eligibility rules.

It entered the Persha Liha as a replacement for the bankrupt club FC Hazovyk-Skala Stryi, which also represented Lviv Oblast. The new entity was registered on 22 May 2006 as a company with limited liability (Ukrainian: \u0422\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e \u0437 \u043e\u0431\u043c\u0435\u0436\u0435\u043d\u043e\u044e \u0432\u0456\u0434\u043f\u043e\u0432\u0456\u0434\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0456\u0441\u0442\u044e) \"Football Club \"Lviv\".

This fact was also confirmed at a press-conference given at the Football Federation of Lviv Oblast on 26 May 2006. The new president of the new club Yuriy Kindzerskyi informed that his club was not created as a municipal club.In its debut season FC Lviv reached 11th place and scored 45 goals. At the start of the next season, in the beginning of September 2007, the club moved to the newly built stadium Kniazha Arena in Dobromyl, west of Sambir. This arena was constructed by and named after Ukrainian insurance company Knyazha, who is the club's main sponsor. The previous home ground of the club was SKA Stadium in Lviv which fell out of favor with the FFU, PFL.\nIn 2007\u201308 season FC Lviv finished 2nd in the Persha Liha and were promoted to the Premier Liha for the first time in their history, making the club one of the founders of the newly formed Premier League. In 2008\u201309 FC Lviv, despite a sensational opening 2\u20130 win against Shakhtar, were relegated to the Persha Liha. The decisive match for them happened in the last round against another Lviv team Karpaty in the Lviv derby when they lost 2\u20131. The club's first, and only, season in the Premier League was spent at The Ukraina Stadium together with Karpaty under a lease contract.\nIn 2009, the city of Lviv lent the former land property of LORTA Plant for rent to FC Lviv. Out of 3.0542 ha FC Lviv receives 2.9 ha in rent until the spring of 2019 and the rest for only five years.\n\n\n=== FC Lviv (since 2016) ===\nIn 2016 the professional team of FC Lviv was renewed and its future participation in Druha Liha was announced.In May 2018, the club was promoted to the Ukrainian Premier League on pretence of merging with NK Veres Rivne and play in the 2018\u201319 Ukrainian Premier League.\nAt its official website, the club tells that all efforts of NK Veres Rivne are actually efforts of FC Lviv instead. The club states that it was FC Lviv that placed 6th in the 2017\u201318 Ukrainian Premier League, while the same claim for this achievement is laid by Veres Rivne. Records however clearly show that at that time FC Lviv played in the 2017\u201318 Ukrainian Second League and recovered their professional status only in 2017. This claim is particularly bold as in 2017 NK Veres Rivne as a \"people's club\" had a big scandal with its promotion ahead of FC Desna Chernihiv.\n\n\n== Players ==\nAs of 8 April 2022\n\n\n=== Team squad ===\nNote: Flags indicate national team as defined under FIFA eligibility rules.

Formed in 1877 at the River Clyde in Glasgow, the club host their home matches at New Douglas Park, having played at Broadwood Stadium from 1994 until 2022. Their biggest accomplishment was winning the Scottish Cup on three occasions: 1939, 1955 and 1958; they reached the final a further three times, all during a long period based at Shawfield. They have not played in the top division of Scottish football since 1975.\nThe team are currently managed by Danny Lennon, who was appointed in November 2017.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 1877\u20131898 ===\nThe Clyde Football Club was founded and played on the banks of the River Clyde at Barrowfield. Documentary evidence from the SFA and indeed match reports in the Glasgow press clearly show it all began in 1877, and the thread continues unbroken to this day.\nHere's how the SFA recorded Clyde's origins:\n\n\"Clyde:- Founded 1877; Membership 50; Grounds (private), Barrowfield Park, on the banks of the Clyde; ten minutes walk from Bridgeton Cross; Club House on grounds; Colours, White & Blue. Hon. Secretary, John D. Graham, 24 Monteith Row.\"\nSitting on the edge of Bridgeton, Barrowfield Park lay in a triangle of land enclosed by Carstairs Street, Colvend Street and the river Clyde. The area was an intense mix of chemical, engineering and textile work with a high population density to provide the labour. Although no stadium photographs have emerged, it appears the ground consisted of a grandstand running north\u2013south, a pavilion and tennis courts at the southern end and a bicycle track surrounding the pitch.\nToday this area is dotted with industrial units, but also contains a large grassed area, so it may be possible to stand upon a corner of the original Barrowfield pitch. Barrowfield got initially shared with a short-lived team called Albatross.\nThe club founded then has no resemblance to a modern professional football club. Clyde F.C. was a private members club more akin to a present-day golf or bowling club. Clyde's Secretary, John Graham, was also a noted rower and it seems the club had other sporting and cultural activities besides football.\nThe first mention of Clyde was in Monday's Evening Times of 17 September 1877:\n\n\"Clyde v T. Lanark\nClyde opened their season at Barrowfield with a match against the 3rd Lanark Volunteers. In the end, the 3rd were victors by three goals to 1.\"\nThis concise report was typical at the time as the sport was of little significance and football competed with racing, bowling and quoting for the limited column space available.\nAlthough most fixtures were informal, the Scottish Cup had existed since 1873. Soon there would also be the Glasgow Merchants Charity Cup and the Glasgow Cup which in their time were hotly contested major competitions. Clyde entered the 1st Round of the Scottish Cup on 29 September 1877 along with one hundred and one other teams. Third Lanark were the visitors once again, and triumphed 1\u20130.\nOn 6 March 1883, the Glasgow Football Association was established (formed to compete with the older - 1877 - rival Edinburgh Association), with Clyde one of the six clubs represented at that first meeting. The club are one of only three founding members clubs still in existence today (with Queen's Park and Rangers).Clyde joined the Scottish Football League in 1891, its second edition. Following acceptance, Vale of Leven provided the opposition for Clyde's first League fixture on Saturday, 15 August 1891. In a dream introduction to the format Clyde triumphed 10\u20133, and a mid-table finish saw the club complete a confident season in League football. While it was an undoubted success, Barrowfield revealed its limitations and could not cope with the crowds as many gained illegal entry. Opposition teams complained about the facilities, and it was clear that Clyde would have to do something to appease the League.\nThe club had the pitch dug up in the off season in 1893 to have the clayey surface replaced by ashes to lend additional facilities to the draining powers of the field.The club enjoyed cup success in local competitions as the 19th century drew to a close. The team won the North Eastern Cup and Graham Cup four times apiece. Both tournaments featured teams from the East End of Glasgow. However, Clyde endured a terrible final season at Barrowfield, finishing bottom of Division 1 with only 5 points, but remained in the top division. The last action at Barrowfield was a friendly against crack opposition in the form of Sunderland on 30 April 1898, ending in a 3\u20133 draw.\n\n\n=== 1899\u20131919 ===\nThe club left Barrowfield in 1898 and purchased some open ground (Shawfield) directly across the river  between the Glasgow neighbourhood of Oatlands and the Lanarkshire town of Rutherglen. The move was largely financed by the club becoming incorporated and issuing shares in \"The Clyde Football Club Limited\". On the eve of a new season, Clyde F.C. Ltd had an enclosed area of about 9 acres (3.6 ha). A grandstand seating of 1500 was nearing completion and embankment works around the pitch were well underway.\n\nLocal rivals Celtic provided the first opposition at Shawfield Stadium on 27 August 1898. An attendance of 10,000 witnessed a goalless draw and return gate receipts of \u00a3203. The 1899\u20131900 season saw the team relegated by finishing bottom of top division.They were Division Two champions in 1904\u201305 (and runners up in 1903\u201304 and 1905\u201306), but there was no promotion until the latter second-place finish. Automatic promotion and relegation was not established until 1921. The following seasons up to World War I would be far more successful and represented the most consistent period of success for the club.From 1908 to 1913, Clyde were at the top end of Division One and reached the Scottish Cup final in 1910 and 1912. The team placed third in 1908\u201309 (three points behind champions Celtic) and in 1911\u201312 and reached further semi finals (in 1908\u201309 and 1912\u201313).The 1910 final was a bitter disappointment. For 83 minutes Clyde (McTurk; Watson & Blair; Walker, McAteer & Robertson; Stirling & McCartney; Chalmers; Jackson & Booth) held a 2\u20130 lead (Chalmers and Booth both scored). However, Robertson fluffed a clearance off Blair and into his own net. Dundee then netted a last minute equalizer from Langlands. The replay was far more cagey and ended goalless after extra time, but with Dundee looking physically stronger. Chalmers struck after three minutes to give Clyde a 1\u20130 lead in the third match. Dundee equalized before half time, and as Clyde looked jaded, John Hunter won the cup for Dundee. The 1912 final was a 2\u20130 defeat to Celtic.International honours were awarded to Clyde for the first time in March 1909, as William Walker represented Scotland against club mate Jack Kirwan of Ireland at Ibrox (5\u20130 to Scotland). The Glasgow Charity Cup (in 1910) and Glasgow Cup (in 1914) were won for the first time. Both were highly prestigious competitions before European football was introduced. All six clubs (Celtic, Clyde, Partick Thistle, Queen's Park, Rangers and Third Lanark) were more often than not resident in Division One.In September 1914, a fire destroyed the grandstand, and with it much of the club's early history. After the war broke out in November 1914, the Scottish League would continue playing. Many players signed up for 'King & Country' \u2013 some never returned, such as C. Clunas (2nd Royal Fusiliers), T. Cranston (Black Watch) and W. Sharp (1st Battalion Royal Scots) \u2013 and teams like Clyde found it increasingly difficult to field competitive sides  and the League eventually reduced back to a single division.\n\n\n=== 1920\u20131945 ===\nThe club had managed to sustain football through the war years, but the Scottish League continued through 1919\u201321 with only one division. Division Two restarted in 1921\u201322, with automatic promotion and relegation adopted. Benefits were evident for ambitious teams, but the financial penalties for falling out of the top tier were extremely severe.Relegated in 1923\u201324, Clyde spent two seasons playing teams like Armadale, Arthurlie, Bathgate, Bo'ness, Broxburn, and King's Park until promotion (and another Glasgow Cup) in 1925\u201326. From 1926 to 1939, Clyde remained a Division One club, as the team maintained a respectable mid-table status. International honours returned to Shawfield, as Danny Blair was a prominent Scotland full back of this era and leading goalscorer Billy Boyd (with 32 goals in 1932\u201333) earned two international caps.Liquidation was narrowly averted in 1930. Greyhound racing was booming in the 1920s and many clubs used this a way to supplement their income. A company offered to lease Shawfield in 1926 and also give a percentage of the gate money to Clyde, but animal racing was forbidden in the deeds of Shawfield and the League was dead set against the sport in general. Chairman John McMahon would not let go of the idea. After years of wrangling, the Shawfield Greyhound Racing Company Ltd started racing in 1932 and a few years later purchased the stadium from Clyde.The team conceded a solitary goal on the run to the 1939 Scottish Cup final. Clean sheets were kept against St Johnstone (2\u20130), Dundee (0\u20130 at Dens Park, followed by 1\u20130 in a replay), city rivals Third Lanark (1\u20130), and the Hibernian semi final match (1\u20130 at Tynecastle). The single goal against came at Rangers in the 3rd Round, where prolific centre forward Willie Martin set a record for an opposition at Ibrox by scoring all four goals in a 4\u20131 win.Clyde (Brown; Kirk and Hickie; Beaton, Falloon and Weir; Robertson and Gillies; Martin; Noble and Wallace) faced Motherwell, who had scored the most goals on route to the final, in front of 94,000 at Hampden on 22 April 1939. After losing the coin toss, Clyde goalkeeper Brown was under the most pressure early on. Assisted by a Robertson delivery, Wallace fired the opener in the roof of the net. Despite further opposition pressure before the interval, Martin doubled the lead with an opportunistic strike after the break. Late goals from Noble (netting from a rebound) and Martin (assisted by Noble for his second) sealed an emphatic 4\u20130 win and a maiden Scottish Cup triumph.War with Nazi Germany caused the suspension of the Scottish League in 1939\u201340, and all players' contracts declared void. Unofficial competitions soon restarted with an East/West regional split. The geographical separation meant Clyde were placed in the Southern League. Runners up behind champions Rangers in 1940\u201341 (by three points), the team would continue to perform relatively well in warttime competitions.A second major cup competition, the Scottish League Cup would be inaugurated in 1946. It was the then Clyde and SFL chairman John McMahon who donated the trophy that is still awarded to the winners of the competition to this day.\n\n\n=== 1946\u20131969 ===\nThe club ventured on a 20-match tour of South Africa in 1947 and recorded 16 wins, 2 draws and 2 defeats. Also in 1953, future Ballon d'Or winner Stanley Matthews (and Blackpool teammate Ernie Taylor) turned out for Clyde against Everton in a benefit match at Celtic Park in Belfast.Leslie Johnston, a then Scotland internationalist, twice broke the Scottish transfer record as a Clyde player in the 1940s.\nThe team showed steady league form just after the war and reached a fourth Scottish Cup final in 1948\u201349. In only the fourth edition of the competition since Clyde won it in 1938\u201339, their opponents Rangers ran out comfortable 4\u20131 winners in front of a crowd of 108,000 at Hampden, with Peter Galletly scoring Clyde's consolation goal. It was claimed that both Rangers penalties were of a dubious nature.The 1950s began with relegation from Division A in 1950\u201351, but returned as Division B champions in 1951\u201352. The team repeated the feat in 1955\u201356 and 1956\u201357. Each occasion saw the team bounce back to solid finishes in Division A. Floodlighting was introduced at Shawfield in March 1954. The first opposition was Huddersfield Town in a friendly match. Huddersfield won 3\u20132. Domestic cup success came readily in the 1950s. They won the Scottish Cup in 1954\u201355 and 1957\u201358 and were beaten semi-finalists in 1955\u201356 and 1959\u201360. They also reached Scottish League Cup semi-finals in 1956\u201357 and 1957\u201358, but lost on both occasions to Celtic.The route to the 1954\u201355 Final began with three straight home victories in the competition against Albion Rovers (3\u20130), Raith Rovers (3\u20131) and Falkirk (5\u20130). Aberdeen provided Clyde's semi-final opponents. After a 2\u20132 draw at Easter Road, a solitary goal in the replay sent Clyde into the final. On 23 April 1955 at Hampden in front of over 96,000, Celtic, installed as firm favourites, provided the opposition in the final, in a match that was also the first to be televised live. Without forward McPhail and goalkeeper Wilson, Clyde lined up:- Hewkins, Murphy & Haddock; Granville, Anderson & Laing; Divers & Robertson; Hill; Brown & Ring. Celtic held a 1\u20130 lead with three minutes left until Robertson scored direct from a corner kick to earn a replay. A crowd of over 68,000 gathered for the replay, with the same Clyde line up, a Tommy Ring goal was enough to win a more open affair.The first half of the League Cup tie with Aberdeen at Shawfield on September 3, 1955, was also televised live (a competition first) by the BBC as an experiment.Back at Hampden on 26 April 1958 in front of a crowd of 94,000 to face a strong Hibernian team, Clyde lined up:- McCulloch, Murphy & Haddock; Walters, Finlay & Clinton; Herd & Currie; Coyle; Robertson & Ring. A deflected strike from Coyle in poor conditions gave Clyde a 1\u20130 win and a second Scottish Cup in four seasons and third overall. Fourth place in the final league table and another League Cup semi-final spot completed an impressive season in 1957\u201358. Haddock, Robertson and Coyle were confirmed in the final Scotland squad for the 1958 FIFA World Cup. Dan Currie was selected in the provisional squad, but did not make the final cut.Clyde gained entry into the Friendship Cup in 1960. It was an inter-League competition between four clubs each from England, France and Scotland, with results aggregated to provide the 'best' League. It proved to be an unpopular format and ended in 1962. For the record, Clyde was drawn against RC Lens of Ligue 1 and beat them 4\u20130 away and 2\u20131 at Shawfield. The club began the 1960s as a yo-yo club. Relegations in 1960\u201361 and 1962\u201363 were followed by immediate promotions in 1961\u201362 and 1963\u201364, the former as Division Two champions.At home to Celtic on September 10, 1966, the Clyde team unusually started the match with squad numbers instead of the traditional (1\u201311) positional numbers on their shirts. The team actually returned from the interval with the routine numbering of 1\u201311.The 1966\u201367 season led Clyde to their highest league finish in forty-five years and another Scottish Cup semi-final appearance. Competing largely as a part-time team, Clyde finished third behind the Old Firm clubs. After producing a wonderful season of football that has marked the high tide in the club's fortunes to date, European football will forever love denying itself. The Inter-Cities Fairs Cup had a rule that stipulated only one team per city could enter. Clyde argued that they were not from Glasgow; they were from Rutherglen. However UEFA denied this argument citing Clyde's non-membership of the Lanarkshire FA and their participation in the Glasgow Cup. Rangers had that position. Another League Cup semi-final was reached in 1968\u201369. The club journeyed on a 10-match tour of Rhodesia in 1969 and remained unbeaten (9 wins and 1 draw).As the 1960s came to a close, Clyde was competing rather comfortably in the top division. It was a different story on the terraces with Glasgow's slum clearance programme hitting attendances hard. Large swathes of housing in Bridgeton, Dalmarnock, Gorbals, Oatlands and Rutherglen were being demolished with the inhabitants decanted away to other parts of the city and beyond. Clyde's core support was drawn from these areas, and many of them have never returned to follow the team.\n\n\n=== 1970\u20131993 ===\nThe club began the 1970s as in previous decades, with the threat of relegation of hanging around. In an attempt to quit the city, there was an attempted merger with Hamilton Academical, who were in dire financial trouble and had resigned from the Scottish League. After the move floundered as quickly as it arose, Hamilton quickly rejoined the League. Less than a year later, Dumbarton of Division Two made an audacious bid to merge with Clyde in Division One at the time in return for a cash settlement. The Scottish League quickly quashed the move, after viewing it as Dumbarton trying to gain back-door entry into the top division.After relegation in 1971\u201372, many club legends such as Harry Glasgow, Sam Hastings, Tommy McCulloch, Graham McFarlane and Eddie Mulheron moved on. Clyde did recover and won promotion as Division Two champions in 1972\u201373. Two years in the top division until another relegation in 1974\u201375 would be their last in the top division to date. The Premier Division was introduced ahead of the season 1975\u201376 as the new top division, with inclusion based upon league position. A poor 16th-place finish in Division One in season 1974\u201375 meant Clyde was never in contention. The club now found themselves back in the second tier, now known as the First Division.The club found a new role, discovering and developing talent before selling it on. Shawfield was the starting point for future Scotland internationalists like Steve Archibald, Ian Ferguson and Pat Nevin. Problems on and off the pitch saw Clyde move into freefall. After finishing bottom of the First Division in 1975\u201376, they found themselves in the Second Division, the third tier, for the season 1976\u201377. They only could muster a seventh-place finish. In a decade Clyde had gone from the third best team in Scotland to a single spot above the finishing last in the Scottish football league system. Towards the end of the season, Celtic legend Billy McNeill took charge but left for Aberdeen after only a few months at the helm. The club then turned to the relatively unknown Craig Brown, and he had immediate success as the team won the Second Division in 1977\u201378.Problems were arising at Shawfield. The stadium was falling into a state of disrepair, and the grounds were not well maintained. By the late 1970s, Shawfield came into the hands of the Greyhound Racing Association (GRA). Greyhound racing had been in decline since 1963 when off-course betting was allowed. To compensate for this, the GRA had transformed itself into a property company and had a policy of acquiring and redeveloping dog tracks for commercial and residential uses.They became the first Scottish club to adopt a shirt sponsor in 1979\u201380. The club secured a deal with the British Oxygen Company. As a guest of the SFA, Fabio Capello worked with manager Craig Brown and the team at Shawfield for a short stint in the early 1980s when he started coaching.Relegation from the First Division in 1979\u201380 was followed by another promotion as Second Division champions in 1981\u201382. Shawfield eventually came on the open market in 1983 with a \u00a3500,000 price tag. The club was served with a notice to quit Shawfield by 1986. Alloa Athletic provided the final opposition at Shawfield on 28 April 1986. Clyde claimed a 4\u20132 win. The unpopular but necessary decision was taken to ground-share with city rivals Partick Thistle. Clyde spent five unhappy seasons at Firhill, and there was a sense of relief when Clyde departed. The club was grateful for the use of Firhill, but there was an underlying sense of being tolerated as an inconvenient annoyance.The 'Gypsy Army' reference came into being as Clyde supporters sought pride and solace during the club's homeless years. The club then negotiated a ground-share at Douglas Park with Hamilton Academical, where Clyde resided for two and a half seasons as plans were developed and implemented to build a new home in Cumbernauld. Meanwhile, on the field, relegation from the First Division in 1990\u201391, was followed by promotion again as Second Division champions in 1992\u201393 and an immediate relegation in 1993\u201394.  However, this continued the tradition of the yo-yo existence the club had become known for at certain times in previous decades.\n\n\n=== 1994\u2013present ===\nThe Cumbernauld Development Corporation was keen to have a sports stadium and professional football team to promote the town, and Cumbernauld, with a 50,000+ population, seemed fertile ground on which to grow new support. A new site called \"Broadwood\" was to have an integrated business, housing and leisure development with a football stadium at the heart of it. With the help of Football Trust backing, two modern stands began to emerge during the early 1990s.\nThe Scottish League unusually granted permission for Clyde to switch grounds mid-season, and former landlords, Hamilton Academical, were the inaugural opposition on 5 February 1994. A capacity crowd of 6000 watched as Clyde lost to the Accies 2\u20130.\nClyde dropped to the third tier of football, and in 1998 they almost fell into the lowest reaches of Senior football. However, this was enough for the new chairman, Billy Carmichael, to introduce changes. Ronnie MacDonald got appointed as manager, having worked at Maryhill Juniors. MacDonald signed a whole squad from the Junior ranks, and within two seasons Clyde had gained promotion.  Subsequently, Allan Maitland won promotion to the Scottish First Division in 1999.\nThe 2003\u201304 season saw Clyde atop the League and looking set for the SPL. But Broadwood did not comply with SPL requirements and crucially Clyde was on the brink of being petitioned by their creditors and liquidated. While the chairman's fortune was well spent on players' wages, very little else got serviced. The SPL relented and said Clyde could join them if the fourth stand got built. North Lanarkshire Council started the groundworks and then abruptly halted them as they became aware of Clyde's financial plight. Plan B, playing at Kilmarnock, was investigated.  In the event, a draw with Ayr United and a home loss to Inverness Caledonian Thistle meant that Clyde missed out on promotion.\nThe Clyde Supporters' Trust formed during the 2003\u201304 season. Early that season some concerned fans met knowing that the chairman could not keep financing the Club indefinitely.  The timing of the Trust's formation coincided with Clyde's failure to gain promotion, and the chairman sought to sell his majority shareholding. Following lengthy negotiations, a consortium of the Trust and traditional investors increased the majority shareholding for a nominal sum. The Clyde Development Consortium took control of funds gathered by fans and investors and used it to finance the Club through a CVA to clear the debts. In June 2005 the CVA was completed, and Clyde was mostly debt free.\nIn a season, 2005\u201306, that saw Clyde lead 2\u20131 from 1\u20130 behind at Rangers in a League Cup tie with 17 minutes left before a goalkeeping error gifted Rangers an equalizer, with Clyde going on to lose in extra time, the other half of the Old Firm, Celtic visited Broadwood in the Scottish Cup on 8 January 2006. Celtic were such heavy favourites that the game was presented as a gentle introduction for their new signing, Roy Keane. Clyde, however, won 2\u20131. The goal scorers for Clyde were Eddie Malone and Craig Bryson whilst Celtic's goal scorer was Maciej Zurawski. Clyde reached the 2006 Challenge Cup Final, their first final for 48 years, since their Scottish Cup success in 1958. They lost the game 5\u20134 on a penalty shootout, after the game finished 1\u20131 following extra time.Former Scotland captain Colin Hendry was appointed manager in summer 2007. On 14 August of that year, Clyde history was made when Michael Doherty became the youngest person ever to play for Clyde in a competitive match, a feat later broken by Connor Stevenson in a league match at Palmerston on 25 April 2009.Hendry resigned in January 2008, due to family reasons. Former Rangers defender John 'Bomber' Brown replaced him as manager. Clyde entered the final game of the season needing to better Morton's result to avoid getting forced into the playoffs. Clyde won their game 3\u20130, but in a cruel twist of fate, Morton won their own game by the same scoreline, sending Clyde into a two-legged play-off with Second Division side Alloa Athletic. Clyde lost the first leg 2\u20131 and at 3\u20131 down in the home second leg looked as good as relegated. However, a thrilling fightback saw Clyde level at 5\u20135 on aggregate (4\u20133 on the day) before adding another goal in extra time to progress. Home and away victories over Airdrie United in the play-off final then secured First Division football at Broadwood for another season.\nHowever, the following season Clyde finished bottom of the First Division and got relegated to the Second Division. Meanwhile, off the park, financial problems were once again apparent. In a hope to try and avoid administration in June 2009, Clyde terminated the contracts of the entire first-team squad, with only youngsters remaining under contract at the club. The squad for 2009\u201310 was rebuilt on a drastically reduced budget with a repeat of open trials which were successful in 2005. However early results were not good, and the board appointed Neil Watt as Director of Football and John McCormack as first team coach. After a brief upturn in results, Clyde went six games without a win, and on Saturday 21 November, with the team sitting three points adrift at the bottom of the Second Division, it was announced that John Brown had left his position as manager. On Monday 5 April John McCormack was sacked by Clyde.More history was made in a home match with Peterhead on 17 April 2010, when Willie Sawyers scored after only eight seconds, which became the fastest Clyde goal ever recorded. Despite this, the club was subsequently relegated for the second season in a row, dropping down to the Third Division where they made a disastrous start to the campaign, including an 8\u20131 thrashing at the hands of Montrose. On Wednesday 2 February 2011, Stuart Millar was sacked as manager of Clyde. They finished 10th in the Third Division, which at 42nd and last place overall is the lowest position in the Scottish league system.\nOn 20 April 2013 Clyde's owners voted to move to East Kilbride and rename the club EK Clyde FC, however this plan would later be abandoned. The 2013\u201314 season saw a significant improvement on the field when a League One play-off spot was secured in the penultimate league match of the season. In the previous six seasons Clyde had finished in the bottom two positions of every league campaign. However, the club missed out on promotion after a play-off semi-final defeat on penalties to East Fife. Gordon Young became the first Clyde player to score with their first touch on their club debut in a match against Elgin City on 1 March 2014.Duffy resigned as manager of Clyde on 19 May 2014 to take up the vacant managerial post at Greenock Morton, while John Taylor, a member of the boardroom since 1986, and the club's longest serving director had stepped down in April. In October 2014, the club were declared officially debt free, having accumulated an unsustainable debt of \u00a31.4 million as a result of the club's failed promotion bid to the SPL during season 2003\u201304, with the burden of debt having weighed heavily on the shoulders of the club for the next decade. Scott Durie became the first Clyde player to play every single minute of every competitive match in a season, during the 2014\u201315 season.Former Rangers, Blackburn and Scotland midfielder Barry Ferguson was appointed as player-manager of Clyde in June 2014 and took the club to a 6th-place finish in his first season in charge. Ferguson officially retired as a player towards the end of that season. The following year, Clyde finished 3rd in League Two but got beaten in the playoff final. On 25 February 2017 with the club in 8th place in League Two after a 1\u20130 defeat to Annan Athletic and with no realistic prospect of gaining promotion after a ten-match winless run, Ferguson resigned as manager of Clyde, with his assistant Bob Malcolm taking interim charge of the side until a new manager was appointed.After nine years in the bottom tier of Scottish football, at the end of the 2018\u201319 season, Danny Lennon led Clyde to promotion to Scottish League One, beating Annan Athletic 2\u20131 on aggregate to win the promotion play-off final.\n\n\n== Grounds ==\n\n\n=== Barrowfield ===\nClyde has had five home grounds since they formed in 1877. The first of these was Barrowfield Park, situated on the banks of the River Clyde between the Glasgow neighbourhoods of Bridgeton and Dalmarnock.\n\n\n=== Shawfield ===\n\nBy 1898, Barrowfield became too small in capacity to deal with the large crowds of spectators. The club then moved across the river to build a new stadium, which would be known as Shawfield Stadium.\nA crowd of 10,000 saw the first match at Shawfield against Celtic. In 1908, a group of 52,000 gathered for a game against Rangers, which remains Clyde's record home attendance to this day. Financial pressures led to the club relinquishing ownership of the stadium in 1935, selling it their former tenants, the Greyhound Racing Association. This arrangement continued satisfactorily for over 50 years until the GRA announced redevelopment plans for the stadium and gave Clyde notice to quit in 1986.\n\n\n=== Broadwood ===\n\nIn 1990, Clyde had secured an agreement to move into a stadium in the new town of Cumbernauld, which due to shifting population patterns was by now one of the larger settlements in Scotland without a senior football team. The new all-seater Broadwood Stadium would not be ready until 1994.\nClyde moved into the venue midway through the 1994\u201395 season. Broadwood has hosted Scotland U21 matches and four Scottish Challenge Cup finals in the past. Broadwood was also home to Airdrieonians for four seasons from 1994 to 1998 and Rangers reserves for a while.\nOn 9 December 2010, Clyde had informed their landlords at North Lanarkshire Council (NL Leisure) of their intention to relinquish their lease on Broadwood and move elsewhere. Furthermore, on 19 October 2011, Clyde revealed that they were investigating the possibility of a move to East Kilbride, the largest town in Scotland without a senior football team. Another option was to move back to Rutherglen and develop the Clyde Gateway Stadium in a ground-sharing agreement. This had received approval from current tenants Rutherglen Glencairn.In April 2022, the club announced they would be leaving Broadwood at the end of the 2021\u201322 season, ending their 28-year stay in Cumbernauld. They will be ground-sharing with Hamilton Academical at New Douglas Park from the start of the 2022\u201323 season, with a view of relocating to a new home back in Glasgow in the near future.\n\n\n=== Groundsharing ===\n\nAfter the Great War began, in September 1914, a fire completely destroyed the grandstand at Shawfield. Clyde were forced to switch their home games for a while. Celtic, the club's East End neighbours, offered up  Celtic Park as an alternative venue for home games.After Celtic Park suffered similar damage in March 1929, The club had to play the rest of their matches in the 1928\u201329 season at nearby Shawfield. (reciprocating an earlier arrangement in 1914 when Clyde suffered similar damage to their ground).On March 1, 1958, Clyde hosted Celtic in the Scottish Cup. Set for Shawfield, the match was moved to Celtic Park over safety concerns. However, Clyde still had home advantage because the home stand tickets were initially reserved for Clyde ticket holders with Celtic tickets ineligible. The Bully Wee won 2\u20130 in front of 65,000, with goals from Ring and Currie. The full back pairing of Haddock and Murphy were reported to have been immense.\n\nAfter quitting Shawfield in 1986, the club investigated several local options. Clyde secured an agreement with arch-rivals Partick Thistle to share their ground Firhill for five seasons until 1991. Despite reaching an agreement to move into Broadwood in 1990, it would not be until 1994 when the ground was ready, so Clyde shared with Hamilton Accies at their Douglas Park for a further three seasons.\n\nThe club negotiated a groundshare with Alloa to use Recreation Park for the club's first home game of the 2012\u201313 season, a first round Challenge Cup match against Partick Thistle. During pre-season work had begun at Broadwood to replace the grass pitch with an artificial surface (astroturf) and the pitch was not finished in time for their first home match of the season. Clyde were confident that the pitch would be completed and all the details finalised for the club's first home league match of the season in time for the visit of Peterhead. The match was switched to Recreation Park for the second successive home game after a pitch inspection carried out earlier in the week by the SFL decided that the pitch was not at the stage of completion as expected. Installation of the new surface was completed in time for the club's next home match of the league season.\n\n\n== Supporters ==\nClyde Football Club is 100% owned by the supporters.The supporters' fiercest rivalry is with Partick Thistle, given that the two clubs are both of smaller stature to that of Rangers and Celtic. However, given the success and promotion of Partick Thistle to the Scottish Premiership, and Clyde's recent relegation to the Scottish League Two, such derby games have become a rarity in past years. Both clubs are in League One together in the 2020\u201321 season.\nThe number of years Clyde spent without a permanent home of their own led to the fans identifying themselves as the Gypsy Army.\nThe Clyde Supporters Social Club on Rutherglen Main Street burned down in the early 2000s and has never been rebuilt or re-opened. There was also a Supporters Club located in Kirkintilloch.The Clyde Supporters' Trust got formed during season 2003\u201304. A group of fans became aware of the club's severe financial problems as Billy Carmichael's reign as chairman came to an end. It was formed in time to save the club and keep it in the supporter's hands in a time that coincided with Clyde's failure to gain promotion and the chairman looking to sell his majority shareholding.In the past the Supporters' Trust has financed the signings of players such as John Potter and Tom Brighton, and retaining the signatures of players such as Neil McGregor and David Hutton.\nThe Clyde supporters also run their own supporters team called Bully Wee United. Bully Wee United are recognised as the official supporters team of Clyde and represent the club in the IFA League with matches well played Saturday mornings. Matches are normally against the supporter's teams of the opposition facing the first team on the same day. Bully Wee United is unique in most Scottish supporters teams as they operate a strict policy that only Clyde supporters may play for the team. Players must attend a minimum number of Clyde games over a season. Clyde is also represented in the Scottish Central Amateur League by another supporters team named Broadwood Clyde. They got formed in 1994. They were crowned SSFL Division One league champions in 2005. They also won the SSFL League Cup in 2004 and SSFL Inter-Division Cup in 2003 making them the most successful Clyde supporters team. Broadwood Clyde play their homes games at Ravenswood in Cumbernauld on Sunday afternoons.\n\n\n=== The Clyde View ===\nThe Clyde View is Clyde's official matchday programme. It won the Scottish Programme of the Year Award every season from 1995\u201396 to 2006\u201307, and again in 2008\u201309. It also won the Scottish Divisional Programme of the Year Award every season from 1991\u201392 to 2011\u201312. It won the inaugural Scottish Divisional Programme Best Design of the Year Award for season 2011\u201312.On Wirrel's UK Programme of the Year, it achieved a top ten finish on three consecutive occasions from 2002\u201303 to 2004\u201305; 8th (2002\u201303), 6th (2003\u201304) and 5th (2004\u201305).\n\n\n== Nickname ==\nThe club's nickname, \"The Bully Wee\", is of uncertain origin although the club themselves have advanced three theories.The first suggests that the clubs and supporters and perhaps players mainly came from Bridgeton, Glasgow, a tight working-class area whose inhabitants had a reputation as \"wee bullies\", with this becoming transposed as the Bully Wee.\nAlternatively, it is also claimed that it comes from around 1900 when a group of French supporters paid a visit to Barrowfield and, upon the scoring of a disputed goal, were heard to remark  \"But il'y, oui?\" or \"Their goal, yes\". Supporters heard this unfamiliar phrase as \"Bully Wee\", and the name stuck.\nFinally the third theory, and the one accepted by the club as the most plausible, links the term to the old Victorian idiom \"bully\" meaning first-rate or high standard and suggests that Clyde, a small club, would have been regularly referred to as \"Bully Wee Clyde\", with the first two words eventually becoming the standalone nickname.\nClyde's supporters also go by the name of \"Gypsy Army\". Due to the number of years the club spent homeless, rival fans called Clyde fans \"gypsies\" as a slur. The supporters of Clyde adopted this as a badge of honour and the \"Gypsy Army\" was born. Despite now having a settled home at Broadwood Stadium the nickname lives on in terracing songs, supporters buses and supporters football teams.\n\n\n== Rivalries ==\nHistorically seen as a Glasgow club, local rivalries (Glasgow derby) were developed and forged with other teams from in and around the city, in particular Celtic (also from the East End), Rangers, Partick Thistle and Queen's Park and the now-defunct Third Lanark.For most of the 20th century, they were six of leading clubs in the country. More often than not all six clubs reside in the top division, with fiercely contested competitions such as the Glasgow Cup and Glasgow Charity Cup (before European football) on top of national tournaments, it saw the clubs pitted against one another multiple times a season.A team called Thistle FC, also known Glasgow or Bridgeton Thistle, were early rivals to the club. Formed a decade before Clyde in 1868, Thistle's first ground was situated nearby at the club's original home Barrowfield Park. Thistle's last fixture was a friendly against the full first team of Clyde at Barrowfield before going out of existence in 1894.The Clyde vs Partick Thistle derby was previously a fierce battle between two of Glasgow's smaller clubs, in comparison to the Old Firm. The rivalry intensified when Thistle became Clyde's landlords at Firhill for five years in the 1980s. The decision to groundshare was never fully accepted by either set of fans. After quitting Clyde on free transfer to sign for the Firhill club (newly promoted to the SPL) in 2002, Jamie Mitchell stated he was shocked by the reaction of Clyde supporters to the move. He referred to it as getting the \"Mo Johnston treatment\". Former Jags midfielder Scott Chaplain (once a signing target for Clyde) spoke of the \"competitive edges to those particular matches\" after playing in the fixtures many times. When talking about a possible groundshare again, Partick Thistle chairman David Beattie said it would reignite the Glasgow-rivalry saying \"the healthy rivalry between ourselves and the Bully Wee is historical\". Due to Partick Thistle's promotion to Scotland's highest professional league, the Scottish Premiership, in the 2010s and Clyde's relegations to the lower leagues in the same period, matches between the two clubs became less common. However, by 2020 they found themselves in the same division (Scottish League One) once again, with a revived version of the Glasgow Cup also offering more meetings.\nDuring the 2010s, Queen's Park became the natural rivals to Clyde, as both clubs were stuck in the bottom league (fourth tier) for the majority of the decade. From 2010 to 2016, Clyde were on a demoralising run of results against Queen's Park: the Spiders won 17 and drew 3 of the 26 matches. This included a run of 11 successive wins (scoring 29 goals in that run).Geographically classed as a North Lanarkshire club since the 1994 move to Cumbernauld, Clyde's matches against Airdrieonians, Albion Rovers, Motherwell or Hamilton Academical can be considered a Lanarkshire derby. In recent times, a rivalry developed with Hamilton.\n\n\n== Managers ==\n\n\n== First-team squad ==\nAs of 3 May 2022Note: Flags indicate national team as defined under FIFA eligibility rules.

The club won the Reserve League Cup for the first time in May 2008. They defeated Livingston 4\u20131 on their own ground at Almondvale with Dave McKay scoring all four goals for Clyde. It was the team's first piece of silverware at reserve level for twenty years. The following season the club were knocked out by Ross County in the semi-finals losing 3\u20130 in Dingwall.\n\n\n=== Reserve team history ===\n\n\n==== 'A' Team ====\nIt was common from the beginning of reserve football for the majority of club's reserve teams (second XI's) to go by the tag \u2018A\u2019 or sometimes \u2018B\u2019 or even \u2018C\u2019 if a club had more than one reserve side. It wasn't until after the formation of the new Scottish Reserve League in 1955 that today's reserve teams go by the actual tag \u2018reserves\u2019 and have done since 1957.During the 1881\u201382 season, Clyde reached the semi-finals of the Scottish 2nd XI Cup in the competitions the first season. In 1896-97 they reached their first 'major' cup final, the Scottish 2nd XI Cup final eventually losing 4\u20130 to Hearts. After reaching the semi-finals again in 1905\u201306, they were thwarted by arch-rivals Partick Thistle this time.\nThe club first joined the Scottish Reserve League in 1909-10 and found the first few years of competing in the league though. It wasn't until the 1913\u201314 season when they made their mark when they lost 1\u20130 at Hearts in a league decider for the Reserve League title. It meant that the club missed out on a unique League and Cup double after they captured the Scottish 2nd XI Cup for the first time that season. They dispatched of St Mirren  in the final over two legs (1-1 away and 3\u20131 at home). They successfully defended the Scottish 2nd XI Cup the following season when Clyde overcame Falkirk in the final over two legs (2-1 loss away and a 3\u20131 home win).\nTheir third and final Scottish 2nd XI Cup triumph came in 1941\u201342. It would be the team's last 'major' cup success for the next sixty-six years. In 1945-46 they reached their last Scottish 2nd XI Cup final losing to Hibs, after a superb 6-2 derby victory over arch-rivals Partick Thistle in the semifinals.The Scottish Reserve League merged with the Scottish C Division (third tier) for the 1949\u201350 season creating two regionalised divisions (South/West and North/East) with Clyde entering a reserve team in the South & West region. The club was crowned champions in 1949\u201350 and they retained their title in 1950\u201351. Despite successive titles, there was no promotion as only first teams could gain promotion to Division B. As reserve teams got excluded from the Scottish League Cup, the C Division had their League Cup. Clyde couldn't quite match the success in the cup that they had in the league as they never won the competition. The best they could manage were semi-final appearances in 1951-52 and in 1953\u201354.\n\n\n==== League restructuring ====\nAfter both regional C Divisions got scrapped in June 1955, a new Scottish Reserve League started up. The new Reserve League was an exclusively all First Division league (a mirror image of the senior league) and all Second Division clubs' reserve sides got excluded from joining. There were several seasons when not all clubs took part. As for teams who were turned away or excluded from joining, they joined various supplementary leagues over the next few years.\nFor the first few seasons between 1955 and 1960, Clyde regularly finished quite high up the table or at least in a mid-table position. From then onwards in the seasons they spent in the league, the team were often at the wrong end of the table.\nIn one of the seasons that Clyde didn't participate in the Reserve League, they joined the Combined Reserve League for a single season in 1961\u201362. Due to the small number of teams involved, the competition got split into an Autumn Series and Spring Series. The club won the Autumn Series and finished second overall in the Combined Table.\nJust like Clyde's first team, whose last spell in the Scottish top flight came in 1974\u201375, the same fate happened to their reserve team following a further league restructure at senior and reserve level. The Reserve League set-up changed again in 1975 after a reorganisation of the 'senior' Scottish League into Premier-First-Second Divisions. The new Premier Reserve League was a mirror image of the new Scottish Premier Division in terms of membership. Lower league clubs used varying set-ups such as east\u2013west sections and midweek competitions. In later games, clubs didn't always participate as running a reserve side became expensive.\nIt wasn't until season 1979\u201380 when Clyde gained membership to re-enter a reserve team in the Scottish Reserve League. They got placed in the regional West division. Finishing bottom in their first season, it was a further two seasons before they returned. They fared much better during the 1987\u201388 season when they won the division. It proved to be a one-off, though. Season 2000\u201301 was Clyde's last in the West Reserves League eventually before all reserves leagues got scrapped after season 2007\u201308.\n\n\n=== Youth teams ===\nThe club ran youth teams at under-20, under-17, under-15, under-14, under-13, under-12, and under-11 level. There was an under-18 team until 2003, when it made way for under-17 and under-19 teams. The under-20 team replaced the under-19 team in 2014. The club also run Football Schools in Cumbernauld (since 2006) and Glasgow Southside (since 2008). Both schools have since been awarded the SFA Quality Mark Award at Standard Level and then at Development Level.The Community Foundation received the Gold award in the SFA Quality Mark category for grassroots football. The Foundation also received the Young Start Award in 2017 to run a project called Start Young, Grow Young. The club were forced to scrap their youth academy from under 11 to under 17 levels in 2015 citing a reduction in funding from the Scottish FA, with the under-20 side the only youth team remaining, which acts as a feeder to the first team for young players.The team reached the Scottish Youth Cup semi finals in 1988, but were beaten by Dunfermline Athletic. The under-17 team reached the SFL Youth Cup final in 2004 losing 4\u20131 on penalties to Hamilton Accies at New Douglas Park despite scoring in stoppage time of extra time to make it 1\u20131. Both of the under-19 and under-17 teams reached the semi finals of their SFL Youth Cups in 2006. The under-19 team finished runners-up behind Celtic in the inaugural SPFL under-19 league in 2014.The under-19 team travelled to the Netherlands in 2003, taking part in a highly rated youth football programme called the Leonardo Project hosted by FC Dordrecht. They played three times against an under-19 team of the hosts, which contained Dutch youth internationalists, winning two and drawing one. In the third match, the opposition was made up of reserves and first team fringe players. They followed this up with a win over local amateur team vv Capelle and a narrow defeat to a youthful FC Utrecht team.The Lanarkshire FA started the Lanarkshire Supercounty Trophy for all four senior Lanarkshire clubs' under-17 teams in 2013. Clyde beat Motherwell in the semi final, but lost to Accies in the final. The under-17's also reached their sectional League Cup final in 2017. The Community Foundation youth teams reached Divisional Cup finals in 2018 and 2019.From the 2018\u201319 season, Clyde have replaced their Under 20 side with a project alongside North Lanarkshire Council called Project Braver, which will see young players play at youth level with a chance to progress to the first team, alongside providing further education or apprenticeship opportunities for the players.\n\n\n==== Graduates ====\nGraduates of the youth team who have gone on to play for the first team since moving to Broadwood Stadium include:\n\nScottish internationals Pat Nevin, Steve Archibald and Ian Ferguson also came through the Clyde youth system.\n\n\n== Hall of Fame ==\n\nThe club launched its official Hall of Fame in 2011, with five inaugural inductees. Three more were inducted in 2012. The Clyde team of season 1966\u201367 was inducted in 2014. There was one inducted in 2015. There is also a Hall of Fame section on the club website.\n\n\n== Honours ==\n\n\n=== Minor trophies ===\n\nGlasgow Cup: 1914\u201315, 1925\u201326, 1946\u201347, 1951\u201352, 1958\u201359\nRunners-up: Fifteen timesGlasgow Merchants Charity Cup1: 1909\u201310, 1939\u201340, 1951\u201352, 1957\u201358, 1960\u201361\nRunners-up: 1911\u201312, 1924\u201325, 1941\u201342, 1943\u201344, 1958\u201359Southern League\n\nRunners-up: 1940\u201341Summer Cup\n\nRunners-up: 1943\u201344West of Scotland League / Shield: 1904\u201305, 1906\u201307\n\nRunners-up: 1905\u201306Glasgow & District Midweek League\n\nRunners-up: 1912\u201313Glasgow North Eastern Cup: 1890\u201391, 1892\u201393, 1893\u201394, 1894\u201395\n\nRunners-up: 1882\u201383, 1885\u201386Graham Cup: 1888\u201389, 1889\u201390, 1890\u201391Paisley Charity Cup: 1938\u201339, 1939\u201340\nRunners-up: 1944\u201345St Vincent de Paul Charity Cup\n\nRunners-up: 1938Friendship Cup: 1960\u201361 (joint-winners)1Clyde shared the trophy with Third Lanark in 1952 and with Celtic in 1961.\n\n\n=== Friendly trophies ===\nKeyline Challenge Cup: 1999, 2000, 2001\n\nRunners-up: 2002Tommy McGrane Cup: 2006Broadwood Cup: 2020Optical Express Challenge Cup\n\nRunners-up: 2005, 2009\n\n\n=== Reserves ===\n\n\n=== Youth ===\nLeague Cup (under 17s):\nRunners-up: 2004\nRangers Youth Invitational Tournament (under 13s):\nWinners: 2008\nHelensburgh Bi-Centennial Tournament (under 13s):\nWinners: 2002\nKildrum United Football Festival (under 13s):\nWinners: 2007\nOban Saints Youth Tournament (under 13s):\nRunners-up: 2011\nCKSSDA 11-a-side Tournament (under 12s):\nWinners: 2008\n\n\n== Records ==\nRecord home attendance: 52,000 vs Rangers (28 November 1908) (at Shawfield Stadium); 8,000 vs Celtic (Scottish Cup) (8 January 2006) (at Broadwood Stadium)\nRecord win: 11\u20131 vs Cowdenbeath (6 October 1951), 10\u20130 vs Stranraer (14 August 1957)\nRecord European win: 4\u20130 vs RC Lens (7 August 1960)\nRecord loss: 11\u20130 vs Dumbarton (22 November 1897)\nMost capped player: Tommy Ring: 12 (Scotland)\nMost international goals: Tommy Ring: 2 (Scotland), Archie Robertson: 2 (Scotland)\nMost goals in one season: Billy McPhail: 36 (1951\u201352), Basil Keogh: 36 (1956\u201357)\nYoungest player: Connor Stevenson, aged 16 years and 245 days (against Queen of the South in the Scottish First Division on 15 April 2009)\n\n\n== Noted players ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nClyde BBC My Club page\nHistorical Kits\nScottish 2nd XI Cup\nScottish Football Federation (Second version 1898-99)\nScottish Football Alliance (First version 1891-1897)\nScottish Football Alliance (Third version 1919-1938)\nScottish Football Alliance (Fifth version 1939-40)\nScottish Football Alliance (Sixth version 1956-57)\nScottish Reserve League (Second version 1909-191)\nScottish Reserve League (Third version 1938-39)\nScottish Reserve League (Fourth version 1945-1949)\nScottish Reserve League (Fifth version 1975-2008)\nScottish (Reserve) League (1955-1975)\nC Division overview (1949-55)\nCombined Reserve Football League (First version 1958-1972)\nCombined Reserve Football League (Second and Third versions 1973-74 & 1975-76)", "infobox": {"clubname": "Clyde", "image": "Clyde FC logo.png", "image_size": "200px", "fullname": "Clyde Football Club", "nickname": "The Bully Wee", "founded": "{{Start date and age|df|=|yes|1877}}", "ground": "[[New Douglas Park]], [[Hamilton, South Lanarkshire|Hamilton]]", "capacity": "{{SPFL-stadiums|hamilton}}", "chairman": "Gordon Thomson", "manager": "[[Danny Lennon]]", "league": "{{Scottish football updater|Clyde}}", "season": "{{Scottish football updater|Clyde2}}", "position": "{{Scottish football updater|Clyde3}}", "pattern_la1": "_pumagoal23wr", "pattern_b1": "_pumagoal23wr", "pattern_ra1": "_pumagoal23wr", "pattern_sh1": "_srb18a", "leftarm1": "FFFFFF", "body1": "FFFFFF", "rightarm1": "FFFFFF", "shorts1": "FFFFFF", "socks1": "FFFFFF", "pattern_la2": "_khimki1819h", "pattern_b2": "_pumahooped1819blackred", "pattern_ra2": "_khimki1819h", "leftarm2": "FF0000", "body2": "FF0000", "rightarm2": "FF0000", "shorts2": "000000", "socks2": "FF0000", "website": "http://www.clydefc.co.uk/"}, "wikidata": {"instance of (P31)": "association football club (Q476028)", "home venue (P115)": ["Broadwood Stadium (Q922974)", "Shawfield Stadium (Q7491246)", "Barrowfield Park (Q21003846)"], "league (P118)": ["Scottish Football League Third Division (Q1394554)", "Scottish Football League (Q2261276)"], "head coach (P286)": "Jim Duffy (Q2778121)", "Commons category (P373)": "Clyde F.C.", "topic's main category (P910)": "Category:Clyde F.C.

Formed in 1877 at the River Clyde in Glasgow, the club host their home matches at New Douglas Park, having played at Broadwood Stadium from 1994 until 2022. Their biggest accomplishment was winning the Scottish Cup on three occasions: 1939, 1955 and 1958; they reached the final a further three times, all during a long period based at Shawfield. They have not played in the top division of Scottish football since 1975.\nThe team are currently managed by Danny Lennon, who was appointed in November 2017.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 1877\u20131898 ===\nThe Clyde Football Club was founded and played on the banks of the River Clyde at Barrowfield. Documentary evidence from the SFA and indeed match reports in the Glasgow press clearly show it all began in 1877, and the thread continues unbroken to this day.\nHere's how the SFA recorded Clyde's origins:\n\n\"Clyde:- Founded 1877; Membership 50; Grounds (private), Barrowfield Park, on the banks of the Clyde; ten minutes walk from Bridgeton Cross; Club House on grounds; Colours, White & Blue. Hon. Secretary, John D. Graham, 24 Monteith Row.\"\nSitting on the edge of Bridgeton, Barrowfield Park lay in a triangle of land enclosed by Carstairs Street, Colvend Street and the river Clyde. The area was an intense mix of chemical, engineering and textile work with a high population density to provide the labour. Although no stadium photographs have emerged, it appears the ground consisted of a grandstand running north\u2013south, a pavilion and tennis courts at the southern end and a bicycle track surrounding the pitch.\nToday this area is dotted with industrial units, but also contains a large grassed area, so it may be possible to stand upon a corner of the original Barrowfield pitch. Barrowfield got initially shared with a short-lived team called Albatross.\nThe club founded then has no resemblance to a modern professional football club. Clyde F.C. was a private members club more akin to a present-day golf or bowling club. Clyde's Secretary, John Graham, was also a noted rower and it seems the club had other sporting and cultural activities besides football.\nThe first mention of Clyde was in Monday's Evening Times of 17 September 1877:\n\n\"Clyde v T. Lanark\nClyde opened their season at Barrowfield with a match against the 3rd Lanark Volunteers. In the end, the 3rd were victors by three goals to 1.\"\nThis concise report was typical at the time as the sport was of little significance and football competed with racing, bowling and quoting for the limited column space available.\nAlthough most fixtures were informal, the Scottish Cup had existed since 1873. Soon there would also be the Glasgow Merchants Charity Cup and the Glasgow Cup which in their time were hotly contested major competitions. Clyde entered the 1st Round of the Scottish Cup on 29 September 1877 along with one hundred and one other teams. Third Lanark were the visitors once again, and triumphed 1\u20130.\nOn 6 March 1883, the Glasgow Football Association was established (formed to compete with the older - 1877 - rival Edinburgh Association), with Clyde one of the six clubs represented at that first meeting. The club are one of only three founding members clubs still in existence today (with Queen's Park and Rangers).Clyde joined the Scottish Football League in 1891, its second edition. Following acceptance, Vale of Leven provided the opposition for Clyde's first League fixture on Saturday, 15 August 1891. In a dream introduction to the format Clyde triumphed 10\u20133, and a mid-table finish saw the club complete a confident season in League football. While it was an undoubted success, Barrowfield revealed its limitations and could not cope with the crowds as many gained illegal entry. Opposition teams complained about the facilities, and it was clear that Clyde would have to do something to appease the League.\nThe club had the pitch dug up in the off season in 1893 to have the clayey surface replaced by ashes to lend additional facilities to the draining powers of the field.The club enjoyed cup success in local competitions as the 19th century drew to a close. The team won the North Eastern Cup and Graham Cup four times apiece. Both tournaments featured teams from the East End of Glasgow. However, Clyde endured a terrible final season at Barrowfield, finishing bottom of Division 1 with only 5 points, but remained in the top division. The last action at Barrowfield was a friendly against crack opposition in the form of Sunderland on 30 April 1898, ending in a 3\u20133 draw.\n\n\n=== 1899\u20131919 ===\nThe club left Barrowfield in 1898 and purchased some open ground (Shawfield) directly across the river  between the Glasgow neighbourhood of Oatlands and the Lanarkshire town of Rutherglen. The move was largely financed by the club becoming incorporated and issuing shares in \"The Clyde Football Club Limited\". On the eve of a new season, Clyde F.C. Ltd had an enclosed area of about 9 acres (3.6 ha). A grandstand seating of 1500 was nearing completion and embankment works around the pitch were well underway.\n\nLocal rivals Celtic provided the first opposition at Shawfield Stadium on 27 August 1898. An attendance of 10,000 witnessed a goalless draw and return gate receipts of \u00a3203. The 1899\u20131900 season saw the team relegated by finishing bottom of top division.They were Division Two champions in 1904\u201305 (and runners up in 1903\u201304 and 1905\u201306), but there was no promotion until the latter second-place finish. Automatic promotion and relegation was not established until 1921. The following seasons up to World War I would be far more successful and represented the most consistent period of success for the club.From 1908 to 1913, Clyde were at the top end of Division One and reached the Scottish Cup final in 1910 and 1912. The team placed third in 1908\u201309 (three points behind champions Celtic) and in 1911\u201312 and reached further semi finals (in 1908\u201309 and 1912\u201313).The 1910 final was a bitter disappointment. For 83 minutes Clyde (McTurk; Watson & Blair; Walker, McAteer & Robertson; Stirling & McCartney; Chalmers; Jackson & Booth) held a 2\u20130 lead (Chalmers and Booth both scored). However, Robertson fluffed a clearance off Blair and into his own net. Dundee then netted a last minute equalizer from Langlands. The replay was far more cagey and ended goalless after extra time, but with Dundee looking physically stronger. Chalmers struck after three minutes to give Clyde a 1\u20130 lead in the third match. Dundee equalized before half time, and as Clyde looked jaded, John Hunter won the cup for Dundee. The 1912 final was a 2\u20130 defeat to Celtic.International honours were awarded to Clyde for the first time in March 1909, as William Walker represented Scotland against club mate Jack Kirwan of Ireland at Ibrox (5\u20130 to Scotland). The Glasgow Charity Cup (in 1910) and Glasgow Cup (in 1914) were won for the first time. Both were highly prestigious competitions before European football was introduced. All six clubs (Celtic, Clyde, Partick Thistle, Queen's Park, Rangers and Third Lanark) were more often than not resident in Division One.In September 1914, a fire destroyed the grandstand, and with it much of the club's early history. After the war broke out in November 1914, the Scottish League would continue playing. Many players signed up for 'King & Country' \u2013 some never returned, such as C. Clunas (2nd Royal Fusiliers), T. Cranston (Black Watch) and W. Sharp (1st Battalion Royal Scots) \u2013 and teams like Clyde found it increasingly difficult to field competitive sides  and the League eventually reduced back to a single division.\n\n\n=== 1920\u20131945 ===\nThe club had managed to sustain football through the war years, but the Scottish League continued through 1919\u201321 with only one division. Division Two restarted in 1921\u201322, with automatic promotion and relegation adopted. Benefits were evident for ambitious teams, but the financial penalties for falling out of the top tier were extremely severe.Relegated in 1923\u201324, Clyde spent two seasons playing teams like Armadale, Arthurlie, Bathgate, Bo'ness, Broxburn, and King's Park until promotion (and another Glasgow Cup) in 1925\u201326. From 1926 to 1939, Clyde remained a Division One club, as the team maintained a respectable mid-table status. International honours returned to Shawfield, as Danny Blair was a prominent Scotland full back of this era and leading goalscorer Billy Boyd (with 32 goals in 1932\u201333) earned two international caps.Liquidation was narrowly averted in 1930. Greyhound racing was booming in the 1920s and many clubs used this a way to supplement their income. A company offered to lease Shawfield in 1926 and also give a percentage of the gate money to Clyde, but animal racing was forbidden in the deeds of Shawfield and the League was dead set against the sport in general. Chairman John McMahon would not let go of the idea. After years of wrangling, the Shawfield Greyhound Racing Company Ltd started racing in 1932 and a few years later purchased the stadium from Clyde.The team conceded a solitary goal on the run to the 1939 Scottish Cup final. Clean sheets were kept against St Johnstone (2\u20130), Dundee (0\u20130 at Dens Park, followed by 1\u20130 in a replay), city rivals Third Lanark (1\u20130), and the Hibernian semi final match (1\u20130 at Tynecastle). The single goal against came at Rangers in the 3rd Round, where prolific centre forward Willie Martin set a record for an opposition at Ibrox by scoring all four goals in a 4\u20131 win.Clyde (Brown; Kirk and Hickie; Beaton, Falloon and Weir; Robertson and Gillies; Martin; Noble and Wallace) faced Motherwell, who had scored the most goals on route to the final, in front of 94,000 at Hampden on 22 April 1939. After losing the coin toss, Clyde goalkeeper Brown was under the most pressure early on. Assisted by a Robertson delivery, Wallace fired the opener in the roof of the net. Despite further opposition pressure before the interval, Martin doubled the lead with an opportunistic strike after the break. Late goals from Noble (netting from a rebound) and Martin (assisted by Noble for his second) sealed an emphatic 4\u20130 win and a maiden Scottish Cup triumph.War with Nazi Germany caused the suspension of the Scottish League in 1939\u201340, and all players' contracts declared void. Unofficial competitions soon restarted with an East/West regional split. The geographical separation meant Clyde were placed in the Southern League. Runners up behind champions Rangers in 1940\u201341 (by three points), the team would continue to perform relatively well in warttime competitions.A second major cup competition, the Scottish League Cup would be inaugurated in 1946. It was the then Clyde and SFL chairman John McMahon who donated the trophy that is still awarded to the winners of the competition to this day.\n\n\n=== 1946\u20131969 ===\nThe club ventured on a 20-match tour of South Africa in 1947 and recorded 16 wins, 2 draws and 2 defeats. Also in 1953, future Ballon d'Or winner Stanley Matthews (and Blackpool teammate Ernie Taylor) turned out for Clyde against Everton in a benefit match at Celtic Park in Belfast.Leslie Johnston, a then Scotland internationalist, twice broke the Scottish transfer record as a Clyde player in the 1940s.\nThe team showed steady league form just after the war and reached a fourth Scottish Cup final in 1948\u201349. In only the fourth edition of the competition since Clyde won it in 1938\u201339, their opponents Rangers ran out comfortable 4\u20131 winners in front of a crowd of 108,000 at Hampden, with Peter Galletly scoring Clyde's consolation goal. It was claimed that both Rangers penalties were of a dubious nature.The 1950s began with relegation from Division A in 1950\u201351, but returned as Division B champions in 1951\u201352. The team repeated the feat in 1955\u201356 and 1956\u201357. Each occasion saw the team bounce back to solid finishes in Division A. Floodlighting was introduced at Shawfield in March 1954. The first opposition was Huddersfield Town in a friendly match. Huddersfield won 3\u20132. Domestic cup success came readily in the 1950s. They won the Scottish Cup in 1954\u201355 and 1957\u201358 and were beaten semi-finalists in 1955\u201356 and 1959\u201360. They also reached Scottish League Cup semi-finals in 1956\u201357 and 1957\u201358, but lost on both occasions to Celtic.The route to the 1954\u201355 Final began with three straight home victories in the competition against Albion Rovers (3\u20130), Raith Rovers (3\u20131) and Falkirk (5\u20130). Aberdeen provided Clyde's semi-final opponents. After a 2\u20132 draw at Easter Road, a solitary goal in the replay sent Clyde into the final. On 23 April 1955 at Hampden in front of over 96,000, Celtic, installed as firm favourites, provided the opposition in the final, in a match that was also the first to be televised live. Without forward McPhail and goalkeeper Wilson, Clyde lined up:- Hewkins, Murphy & Haddock; Granville, Anderson & Laing; Divers & Robertson; Hill; Brown & Ring. Celtic held a 1\u20130 lead with three minutes left until Robertson scored direct from a corner kick to earn a replay. A crowd of over 68,000 gathered for the replay, with the same Clyde line up, a Tommy Ring goal was enough to win a more open affair.The first half of the League Cup tie with Aberdeen at Shawfield on September 3, 1955, was also televised live (a competition first) by the BBC as an experiment.Back at Hampden on 26 April 1958 in front of a crowd of 94,000 to face a strong Hibernian team, Clyde lined up:- McCulloch, Murphy & Haddock; Walters, Finlay & Clinton; Herd & Currie; Coyle; Robertson & Ring. A deflected strike from Coyle in poor conditions gave Clyde a 1\u20130 win and a second Scottish Cup in four seasons and third overall. Fourth place in the final league table and another League Cup semi-final spot completed an impressive season in 1957\u201358. Haddock, Robertson and Coyle were confirmed in the final Scotland squad for the 1958 FIFA World Cup. Dan Currie was selected in the provisional squad, but did not make the final cut.Clyde gained entry into the Friendship Cup in 1960. It was an inter-League competition between four clubs each from England, France and Scotland, with results aggregated to provide the 'best' League. It proved to be an unpopular format and ended in 1962. For the record, Clyde was drawn against RC Lens of Ligue 1 and beat them 4\u20130 away and 2\u20131 at Shawfield. The club began the 1960s as a yo-yo club. Relegations in 1960\u201361 and 1962\u201363 were followed by immediate promotions in 1961\u201362 and 1963\u201364, the former as Division Two champions.At home to Celtic on September 10, 1966, the Clyde team unusually started the match with squad numbers instead of the traditional (1\u201311) positional numbers on their shirts. The team actually returned from the interval with the routine numbering of 1\u201311.The 1966\u201367 season led Clyde to their highest league finish in forty-five years and another Scottish Cup semi-final appearance. Competing largely as a part-time team, Clyde finished third behind the Old Firm clubs. After producing a wonderful season of football that has marked the high tide in the club's fortunes to date, European football will forever love denying itself. The Inter-Cities Fairs Cup had a rule that stipulated only one team per city could enter. Clyde argued that they were not from Glasgow; they were from Rutherglen. However UEFA denied this argument citing Clyde's non-membership of the Lanarkshire FA and their participation in the Glasgow Cup. Rangers had that position. Another League Cup semi-final was reached in 1968\u201369. The club journeyed on a 10-match tour of Rhodesia in 1969 and remained unbeaten (9 wins and 1 draw).As the 1960s came to a close, Clyde was competing rather comfortably in the top division. It was a different story on the terraces with Glasgow's slum clearance programme hitting attendances hard. Large swathes of housing in Bridgeton, Dalmarnock, Gorbals, Oatlands and Rutherglen were being demolished with the inhabitants decanted away to other parts of the city and beyond. Clyde's core support was drawn from these areas, and many of them have never returned to follow the team.\n\n\n=== 1970\u20131993 ===\nThe club began the 1970s as in previous decades, with the threat of relegation of hanging around. In an attempt to quit the city, there was an attempted merger with Hamilton Academical, who were in dire financial trouble and had resigned from the Scottish League. After the move floundered as quickly as it arose, Hamilton quickly rejoined the League. Less than a year later, Dumbarton of Division Two made an audacious bid to merge with Clyde in Division One at the time in return for a cash settlement. The Scottish League quickly quashed the move, after viewing it as Dumbarton trying to gain back-door entry into the top division.After relegation in 1971\u201372, many club legends such as Harry Glasgow, Sam Hastings, Tommy McCulloch, Graham McFarlane and Eddie Mulheron moved on. Clyde did recover and won promotion as Division Two champions in 1972\u201373. Two years in the top division until another relegation in 1974\u201375 would be their last in the top division to date. The Premier Division was introduced ahead of the season 1975\u201376 as the new top division, with inclusion based upon league position. A poor 16th-place finish in Division One in season 1974\u201375 meant Clyde was never in contention. The club now found themselves back in the second tier, now known as the First Division.The club found a new role, discovering and developing talent before selling it on. Shawfield was the starting point for future Scotland internationalists like Steve Archibald, Ian Ferguson and Pat Nevin. Problems on and off the pitch saw Clyde move into freefall. After finishing bottom of the First Division in 1975\u201376, they found themselves in the Second Division, the third tier, for the season 1976\u201377. They only could muster a seventh-place finish. In a decade Clyde had gone from the third best team in Scotland to a single spot above the finishing last in the Scottish football league system. Towards the end of the season, Celtic legend Billy McNeill took charge but left for Aberdeen after only a few months at the helm. The club then turned to the relatively unknown Craig Brown, and he had immediate success as the team won the Second Division in 1977\u201378.Problems were arising at Shawfield. The stadium was falling into a state of disrepair, and the grounds were not well maintained. By the late 1970s, Shawfield came into the hands of the Greyhound Racing Association (GRA). Greyhound racing had been in decline since 1963 when off-course betting was allowed. To compensate for this, the GRA had transformed itself into a property company and had a policy of acquiring and redeveloping dog tracks for commercial and residential uses.They became the first Scottish club to adopt a shirt sponsor in 1979\u201380. The club secured a deal with the British Oxygen Company. As a guest of the SFA, Fabio Capello worked with manager Craig Brown and the team at Shawfield for a short stint in the early 1980s when he started coaching.Relegation from the First Division in 1979\u201380 was followed by another promotion as Second Division champions in 1981\u201382. Shawfield eventually came on the open market in 1983 with a \u00a3500,000 price tag. The club was served with a notice to quit Shawfield by 1986. Alloa Athletic provided the final opposition at Shawfield on 28 April 1986. Clyde claimed a 4\u20132 win. The unpopular but necessary decision was taken to ground-share with city rivals Partick Thistle. Clyde spent five unhappy seasons at Firhill, and there was a sense of relief when Clyde departed. The club was grateful for the use of Firhill, but there was an underlying sense of being tolerated as an inconvenient annoyance.The 'Gypsy Army' reference came into being as Clyde supporters sought pride and solace during the club's homeless years. The club then negotiated a ground-share at Douglas Park with Hamilton Academical, where Clyde resided for two and a half seasons as plans were developed and implemented to build a new home in Cumbernauld. Meanwhile, on the field, relegation from the First Division in 1990\u201391, was followed by promotion again as Second Division champions in 1992\u201393 and an immediate relegation in 1993\u201394.  However, this continued the tradition of the yo-yo existence the club had become known for at certain times in previous decades.\n\n\n=== 1994\u2013present ===\nThe Cumbernauld Development Corporation was keen to have a sports stadium and professional football team to promote the town, and Cumbernauld, with a 50,000+ population, seemed fertile ground on which to grow new support. A new site called \"Broadwood\" was to have an integrated business, housing and leisure development with a football stadium at the heart of it. With the help of Football Trust backing, two modern stands began to emerge during the early 1990s.\nThe Scottish League unusually granted permission for Clyde to switch grounds mid-season, and former landlords, Hamilton Academical, were the inaugural opposition on 5 February 1994. A capacity crowd of 6000 watched as Clyde lost to the Accies 2\u20130.\nClyde dropped to the third tier of football, and in 1998 they almost fell into the lowest reaches of Senior football. However, this was enough for the new chairman, Billy Carmichael, to introduce changes. Ronnie MacDonald got appointed as manager, having worked at Maryhill Juniors. MacDonald signed a whole squad from the Junior ranks, and within two seasons Clyde had gained promotion.  Subsequently, Allan Maitland won promotion to the Scottish First Division in 1999.\nThe 2003\u201304 season saw Clyde atop the League and looking set for the SPL. But Broadwood did not comply with SPL requirements and crucially Clyde was on the brink of being petitioned by their creditors and liquidated. While the chairman's fortune was well spent on players' wages, very little else got serviced. The SPL relented and said Clyde could join them if the fourth stand got built. North Lanarkshire Council started the groundworks and then abruptly halted them as they became aware of Clyde's financial plight. Plan B, playing at Kilmarnock, was investigated.  In the event, a draw with Ayr United and a home loss to Inverness Caledonian Thistle meant that Clyde missed out on promotion.\nThe Clyde Supporters' Trust formed during the 2003\u201304 season. Early that season some concerned fans met knowing that the chairman could not keep financing the Club indefinitely.  The timing of the Trust's formation coincided with Clyde's failure to gain promotion, and the chairman sought to sell his majority shareholding. Following lengthy negotiations, a consortium of the Trust and traditional investors increased the majority shareholding for a nominal sum. The Clyde Development Consortium took control of funds gathered by fans and investors and used it to finance the Club through a CVA to clear the debts. In June 2005 the CVA was completed, and Clyde was mostly debt free.\nIn a season, 2005\u201306, that saw Clyde lead 2\u20131 from 1\u20130 behind at Rangers in a League Cup tie with 17 minutes left before a goalkeeping error gifted Rangers an equalizer, with Clyde going on to lose in extra time, the other half of the Old Firm, Celtic visited Broadwood in the Scottish Cup on 8 January 2006. Celtic were such heavy favourites that the game was presented as a gentle introduction for their new signing, Roy Keane. Clyde, however, won 2\u20131. The goal scorers for Clyde were Eddie Malone and Craig Bryson whilst Celtic's goal scorer was Maciej Zurawski. Clyde reached the 2006 Challenge Cup Final, their first final for 48 years, since their Scottish Cup success in 1958. They lost the game 5\u20134 on a penalty shootout, after the game finished 1\u20131 following extra time.Former Scotland captain Colin Hendry was appointed manager in summer 2007. On 14 August of that year, Clyde history was made when Michael Doherty became the youngest person ever to play for Clyde in a competitive match, a feat later broken by Connor Stevenson in a league match at Palmerston on 25 April 2009.Hendry resigned in January 2008, due to family reasons. Former Rangers defender John 'Bomber' Brown replaced him as manager. Clyde entered the final game of the season needing to better Morton's result to avoid getting forced into the playoffs. Clyde won their game 3\u20130, but in a cruel twist of fate, Morton won their own game by the same scoreline, sending Clyde into a two-legged play-off with Second Division side Alloa Athletic. Clyde lost the first leg 2\u20131 and at 3\u20131 down in the home second leg looked as good as relegated. However, a thrilling fightback saw Clyde level at 5\u20135 on aggregate (4\u20133 on the day) before adding another goal in extra time to progress. Home and away victories over Airdrie United in the play-off final then secured First Division football at Broadwood for another season.\nHowever, the following season Clyde finished bottom of the First Division and got relegated to the Second Division. Meanwhile, off the park, financial problems were once again apparent. In a hope to try and avoid administration in June 2009, Clyde terminated the contracts of the entire first-team squad, with only youngsters remaining under contract at the club. The squad for 2009\u201310 was rebuilt on a drastically reduced budget with a repeat of open trials which were successful in 2005. However early results were not good, and the board appointed Neil Watt as Director of Football and John McCormack as first team coach. After a brief upturn in results, Clyde went six games without a win, and on Saturday 21 November, with the team sitting three points adrift at the bottom of the Second Division, it was announced that John Brown had left his position as manager. On Monday 5 April John McCormack was sacked by Clyde.More history was made in a home match with Peterhead on 17 April 2010, when Willie Sawyers scored after only eight seconds, which became the fastest Clyde goal ever recorded. Despite this, the club was subsequently relegated for the second season in a row, dropping down to the Third Division where they made a disastrous start to the campaign, including an 8\u20131 thrashing at the hands of Montrose. On Wednesday 2 February 2011, Stuart Millar was sacked as manager of Clyde. They finished 10th in the Third Division, which at 42nd and last place overall is the lowest position in the Scottish league system.\nOn 20 April 2013 Clyde's owners voted to move to East Kilbride and rename the club EK Clyde FC, however this plan would later be abandoned. The 2013\u201314 season saw a significant improvement on the field when a League One play-off spot was secured in the penultimate league match of the season. In the previous six seasons Clyde had finished in the bottom two positions of every league campaign. However, the club missed out on promotion after a play-off semi-final defeat on penalties to East Fife. Gordon Young became the first Clyde player to score with their first touch on their club debut in a match against Elgin City on 1 March 2014.Duffy resigned as manager of Clyde on 19 May 2014 to take up the vacant managerial post at Greenock Morton, while John Taylor, a member of the boardroom since 1986, and the club's longest serving director had stepped down in April. In October 2014, the club were declared officially debt free, having accumulated an unsustainable debt of \u00a31.4 million as a result of the club's failed promotion bid to the SPL during season 2003\u201304, with the burden of debt having weighed heavily on the shoulders of the club for the next decade. Scott Durie became the first Clyde player to play every single minute of every competitive match in a season, during the 2014\u201315 season.Former Rangers, Blackburn and Scotland midfielder Barry Ferguson was appointed as player-manager of Clyde in June 2014 and took the club to a 6th-place finish in his first season in charge. Ferguson officially retired as a player towards the end of that season. The following year, Clyde finished 3rd in League Two but got beaten in the playoff final. On 25 February 2017 with the club in 8th place in League Two after a 1\u20130 defeat to Annan Athletic and with no realistic prospect of gaining promotion after a ten-match winless run, Ferguson resigned as manager of Clyde, with his assistant Bob Malcolm taking interim charge of the side until a new manager was appointed.After nine years in the bottom tier of Scottish football, at the end of the 2018\u201319 season, Danny Lennon led Clyde to promotion to Scottish League One, beating Annan Athletic 2\u20131 on aggregate to win the promotion play-off final.\n\n\n== Grounds ==\n\n\n=== Barrowfield ===\nClyde has had five home grounds since they formed in 1877. The first of these was Barrowfield Park, situated on the banks of the River Clyde between the Glasgow neighbourhoods of Bridgeton and Dalmarnock.\n\n\n=== Shawfield ===\n\nBy 1898, Barrowfield became too small in capacity to deal with the large crowds of spectators. The club then moved across the river to build a new stadium, which would be known as Shawfield Stadium.\nA crowd of 10,000 saw the first match at Shawfield against Celtic. In 1908, a group of 52,000 gathered for a game against Rangers, which remains Clyde's record home attendance to this day. Financial pressures led to the club relinquishing ownership of the stadium in 1935, selling it their former tenants, the Greyhound Racing Association. This arrangement continued satisfactorily for over 50 years until the GRA announced redevelopment plans for the stadium and gave Clyde notice to quit in 1986.\n\n\n=== Broadwood ===\n\nIn 1990, Clyde had secured an agreement to move into a stadium in the new town of Cumbernauld, which due to shifting population patterns was by now one of the larger settlements in Scotland without a senior football team. The new all-seater Broadwood Stadium would not be ready until 1994.\nClyde moved into the venue midway through the 1994\u201395 season. Broadwood has hosted Scotland U21 matches and four Scottish Challenge Cup finals in the past. Broadwood was also home to Airdrieonians for four seasons from 1994 to 1998 and Rangers reserves for a while.\nOn 9 December 2010, Clyde had informed their landlords at North Lanarkshire Council (NL Leisure) of their intention to relinquish their lease on Broadwood and move elsewhere. Furthermore, on 19 October 2011, Clyde revealed that they were investigating the possibility of a move to East Kilbride, the largest town in Scotland without a senior football team. Another option was to move back to Rutherglen and develop the Clyde Gateway Stadium in a ground-sharing agreement. This had received approval from current tenants Rutherglen Glencairn.In April 2022, the club announced they would be leaving Broadwood at the end of the 2021\u201322 season, ending their 28-year stay in Cumbernauld. They will be ground-sharing with Hamilton Academical at New Douglas Park from the start of the 2022\u201323 season, with a view of relocating to a new home back in Glasgow in the near future.\n\n\n=== Groundsharing ===\n\nAfter the Great War began, in September 1914, a fire completely destroyed the grandstand at Shawfield. Clyde were forced to switch their home games for a while. Celtic, the club's East End neighbours, offered up  Celtic Park as an alternative venue for home games.After Celtic Park suffered similar damage in March 1929, The club had to play the rest of their matches in the 1928\u201329 season at nearby Shawfield. (reciprocating an earlier arrangement in 1914 when Clyde suffered similar damage to their ground).On March 1, 1958, Clyde hosted Celtic in the Scottish Cup. Set for Shawfield, the match was moved to Celtic Park over safety concerns. However, Clyde still had home advantage because the home stand tickets were initially reserved for Clyde ticket holders with Celtic tickets ineligible. The Bully Wee won 2\u20130 in front of 65,000, with goals from Ring and Currie. The full back pairing of Haddock and Murphy were reported to have been immense.\n\nAfter quitting Shawfield in 1986, the club investigated several local options. Clyde secured an agreement with arch-rivals Partick Thistle to share their ground Firhill for five seasons until 1991. Despite reaching an agreement to move into Broadwood in 1990, it would not be until 1994 when the ground was ready, so Clyde shared with Hamilton Accies at their Douglas Park for a further three seasons.\n\nThe club negotiated a groundshare with Alloa to use Recreation Park for the club's first home game of the 2012\u201313 season, a first round Challenge Cup match against Partick Thistle. During pre-season work had begun at Broadwood to replace the grass pitch with an artificial surface (astroturf) and the pitch was not finished in time for their first home match of the season. Clyde were confident that the pitch would be completed and all the details finalised for the club's first home league match of the season in time for the visit of Peterhead. The match was switched to Recreation Park for the second successive home game after a pitch inspection carried out earlier in the week by the SFL decided that the pitch was not at the stage of completion as expected. Installation of the new surface was completed in time for the club's next home match of the league season.\n\n\n== Supporters ==\nClyde Football Club is 100% owned by the supporters.The supporters' fiercest rivalry is with Partick Thistle, given that the two clubs are both of smaller stature to that of Rangers and Celtic. However, given the success and promotion of Partick Thistle to the Scottish Premiership, and Clyde's recent relegation to the Scottish League Two, such derby games have become a rarity in past years. Both clubs are in League One together in the 2020\u201321 season.\nThe number of years Clyde spent without a permanent home of their own led to the fans identifying themselves as the Gypsy Army.\nThe Clyde Supporters Social Club on Rutherglen Main Street burned down in the early 2000s and has never been rebuilt or re-opened. There was also a Supporters Club located in Kirkintilloch.The Clyde Supporters' Trust got formed during season 2003\u201304. A group of fans became aware of the club's severe financial problems as Billy Carmichael's reign as chairman came to an end. It was formed in time to save the club and keep it in the supporter's hands in a time that coincided with Clyde's failure to gain promotion and the chairman looking to sell his majority shareholding.In the past the Supporters' Trust has financed the signings of players such as John Potter and Tom Brighton, and retaining the signatures of players such as Neil McGregor and David Hutton.\nThe Clyde supporters also run their own supporters team called Bully Wee United. Bully Wee United are recognised as the official supporters team of Clyde and represent the club in the IFA League with matches well played Saturday mornings. Matches are normally against the supporter's teams of the opposition facing the first team on the same day. Bully Wee United is unique in most Scottish supporters teams as they operate a strict policy that only Clyde supporters may play for the team. Players must attend a minimum number of Clyde games over a season. Clyde is also represented in the Scottish Central Amateur League by another supporters team named Broadwood Clyde. They got formed in 1994. They were crowned SSFL Division One league champions in 2005. They also won the SSFL League Cup in 2004 and SSFL Inter-Division Cup in 2003 making them the most successful Clyde supporters team. Broadwood Clyde play their homes games at Ravenswood in Cumbernauld on Sunday afternoons.\n\n\n=== The Clyde View ===\nThe Clyde View is Clyde's official matchday programme. It won the Scottish Programme of the Year Award every season from 1995\u201396 to 2006\u201307, and again in 2008\u201309. It also won the Scottish Divisional Programme of the Year Award every season from 1991\u201392 to 2011\u201312. It won the inaugural Scottish Divisional Programme Best Design of the Year Award for season 2011\u201312.On Wirrel's UK Programme of the Year, it achieved a top ten finish on three consecutive occasions from 2002\u201303 to 2004\u201305; 8th (2002\u201303), 6th (2003\u201304) and 5th (2004\u201305).\n\n\n== Nickname ==\nThe club's nickname, \"The Bully Wee\", is of uncertain origin although the club themselves have advanced three theories.The first suggests that the clubs and supporters and perhaps players mainly came from Bridgeton, Glasgow, a tight working-class area whose inhabitants had a reputation as \"wee bullies\", with this becoming transposed as the Bully Wee.\nAlternatively, it is also claimed that it comes from around 1900 when a group of French supporters paid a visit to Barrowfield and, upon the scoring of a disputed goal, were heard to remark  \"But il'y, oui?\" or \"Their goal, yes\". Supporters heard this unfamiliar phrase as \"Bully Wee\", and the name stuck.\nFinally the third theory, and the one accepted by the club as the most plausible, links the term to the old Victorian idiom \"bully\" meaning first-rate or high standard and suggests that Clyde, a small club, would have been regularly referred to as \"Bully Wee Clyde\", with the first two words eventually becoming the standalone nickname.\nClyde's supporters also go by the name of \"Gypsy Army\". Due to the number of years the club spent homeless, rival fans called Clyde fans \"gypsies\" as a slur. The supporters of Clyde adopted this as a badge of honour and the \"Gypsy Army\" was born. Despite now having a settled home at Broadwood Stadium the nickname lives on in terracing songs, supporters buses and supporters football teams.\n\n\n== Rivalries ==\nHistorically seen as a Glasgow club, local rivalries (Glasgow derby) were developed and forged with other teams from in and around the city, in particular Celtic (also from the East End), Rangers, Partick Thistle and Queen's Park and the now-defunct Third Lanark.For most of the 20th century, they were six of leading clubs in the country. More often than not all six clubs reside in the top division, with fiercely contested competitions such as the Glasgow Cup and Glasgow Charity Cup (before European football) on top of national tournaments, it saw the clubs pitted against one another multiple times a season.A team called Thistle FC, also known Glasgow or Bridgeton Thistle, were early rivals to the club. Formed a decade before Clyde in 1868, Thistle's first ground was situated nearby at the club's original home Barrowfield Park. Thistle's last fixture was a friendly against the full first team of Clyde at Barrowfield before going out of existence in 1894.The Clyde vs Partick Thistle derby was previously a fierce battle between two of Glasgow's smaller clubs, in comparison to the Old Firm. The rivalry intensified when Thistle became Clyde's landlords at Firhill for five years in the 1980s. The decision to groundshare was never fully accepted by either set of fans. After quitting Clyde on free transfer to sign for the Firhill club (newly promoted to the SPL) in 2002, Jamie Mitchell stated he was shocked by the reaction of Clyde supporters to the move. He referred to it as getting the \"Mo Johnston treatment\". Former Jags midfielder Scott Chaplain (once a signing target for Clyde) spoke of the \"competitive edges to those particular matches\" after playing in the fixtures many times. When talking about a possible groundshare again, Partick Thistle chairman David Beattie said it would reignite the Glasgow-rivalry saying \"the healthy rivalry between ourselves and the Bully Wee is historical\". Due to Partick Thistle's promotion to Scotland's highest professional league, the Scottish Premiership, in the 2010s and Clyde's relegations to the lower leagues in the same period, matches between the two clubs became less common. However, by 2020 they found themselves in the same division (Scottish League One) once again, with a revived version of the Glasgow Cup also offering more meetings.\nDuring the 2010s, Queen's Park became the natural rivals to Clyde, as both clubs were stuck in the bottom league (fourth tier) for the majority of the decade. From 2010 to 2016, Clyde were on a demoralising run of results against Queen's Park: the Spiders won 17 and drew 3 of the 26 matches. This included a run of 11 successive wins (scoring 29 goals in that run).Geographically classed as a North Lanarkshire club since the 1994 move to Cumbernauld, Clyde's matches against Airdrieonians, Albion Rovers, Motherwell or Hamilton Academical can be considered a Lanarkshire derby. In recent times, a rivalry developed with Hamilton.\n\n\n== Managers ==\n\n\n== First-team squad ==\nAs of 3 May 2022Note: Flags indicate national team as defined under FIFA eligibility rules.

The club won the Reserve League Cup for the first time in May 2008. They defeated Livingston 4\u20131 on their own ground at Almondvale with Dave McKay scoring all four goals for Clyde. It was the team's first piece of silverware at reserve level for twenty years. The following season the club were knocked out by Ross County in the semi-finals losing 3\u20130 in Dingwall.\n\n\n=== Reserve team history ===\n\n\n==== 'A' Team ====\nIt was common from the beginning of reserve football for the majority of club's reserve teams (second XI's) to go by the tag \u2018A\u2019 or sometimes \u2018B\u2019 or even \u2018C\u2019 if a club had more than one reserve side. It wasn't until after the formation of the new Scottish Reserve League in 1955 that today's reserve teams go by the actual tag \u2018reserves\u2019 and have done since 1957.During the 1881\u201382 season, Clyde reached the semi-finals of the Scottish 2nd XI Cup in the competitions the first season. In 1896-97 they reached their first 'major' cup final, the Scottish 2nd XI Cup final eventually losing 4\u20130 to Hearts. After reaching the semi-finals again in 1905\u201306, they were thwarted by arch-rivals Partick Thistle this time.\nThe club first joined the Scottish Reserve League in 1909-10 and found the first few years of competing in the league though. It wasn't until the 1913\u201314 season when they made their mark when they lost 1\u20130 at Hearts in a league decider for the Reserve League title. It meant that the club missed out on a unique League and Cup double after they captured the Scottish 2nd XI Cup for the first time that season. They dispatched of St Mirren  in the final over two legs (1-1 away and 3\u20131 at home). They successfully defended the Scottish 2nd XI Cup the following season when Clyde overcame Falkirk in the final over two legs (2-1 loss away and a 3\u20131 home win).\nTheir third and final Scottish 2nd XI Cup triumph came in 1941\u201342. It would be the team's last 'major' cup success for the next sixty-six years. In 1945-46 they reached their last Scottish 2nd XI Cup final losing to Hibs, after a superb 6-2 derby victory over arch-rivals Partick Thistle in the semifinals.The Scottish Reserve League merged with the Scottish C Division (third tier) for the 1949\u201350 season creating two regionalised divisions (South/West and North/East) with Clyde entering a reserve team in the South & West region. The club was crowned champions in 1949\u201350 and they retained their title in 1950\u201351. Despite successive titles, there was no promotion as only first teams could gain promotion to Division B. As reserve teams got excluded from the Scottish League Cup, the C Division had their League Cup. Clyde couldn't quite match the success in the cup that they had in the league as they never won the competition. The best they could manage were semi-final appearances in 1951-52 and in 1953\u201354.\n\n\n==== League restructuring ====\nAfter both regional C Divisions got scrapped in June 1955, a new Scottish Reserve League started up. The new Reserve League was an exclusively all First Division league (a mirror image of the senior league) and all Second Division clubs' reserve sides got excluded from joining. There were several seasons when not all clubs took part. As for teams who were turned away or excluded from joining, they joined various supplementary leagues over the next few years.\nFor the first few seasons between 1955 and 1960, Clyde regularly finished quite high up the table or at least in a mid-table position. From then onwards in the seasons they spent in the league, the team were often at the wrong end of the table.\nIn one of the seasons that Clyde didn't participate in the Reserve League, they joined the Combined Reserve League for a single season in 1961\u201362. Due to the small number of teams involved, the competition got split into an Autumn Series and Spring Series. The club won the Autumn Series and finished second overall in the Combined Table.\nJust like Clyde's first team, whose last spell in the Scottish top flight came in 1974\u201375, the same fate happened to their reserve team following a further league restructure at senior and reserve level. The Reserve League set-up changed again in 1975 after a reorganisation of the 'senior' Scottish League into Premier-First-Second Divisions. The new Premier Reserve League was a mirror image of the new Scottish Premier Division in terms of membership. Lower league clubs used varying set-ups such as east\u2013west sections and midweek competitions. In later games, clubs didn't always participate as running a reserve side became expensive.\nIt wasn't until season 1979\u201380 when Clyde gained membership to re-enter a reserve team in the Scottish Reserve League. They got placed in the regional West division. Finishing bottom in their first season, it was a further two seasons before they returned. They fared much better during the 1987\u201388 season when they won the division. It proved to be a one-off, though. Season 2000\u201301 was Clyde's last in the West Reserves League eventually before all reserves leagues got scrapped after season 2007\u201308.\n\n\n=== Youth teams ===\nThe club ran youth teams at under-20, under-17, under-15, under-14, under-13, under-12, and under-11 level. There was an under-18 team until 2003, when it made way for under-17 and under-19 teams. The under-20 team replaced the under-19 team in 2014. The club also run Football Schools in Cumbernauld (since 2006) and Glasgow Southside (since 2008). Both schools have since been awarded the SFA Quality Mark Award at Standard Level and then at Development Level.The Community Foundation received the Gold award in the SFA Quality Mark category for grassroots football. The Foundation also received the Young Start Award in 2017 to run a project called Start Young, Grow Young. The club were forced to scrap their youth academy from under 11 to under 17 levels in 2015 citing a reduction in funding from the Scottish FA, with the under-20 side the only youth team remaining, which acts as a feeder to the first team for young players.The team reached the Scottish Youth Cup semi finals in 1988, but were beaten by Dunfermline Athletic. The under-17 team reached the SFL Youth Cup final in 2004 losing 4\u20131 on penalties to Hamilton Accies at New Douglas Park despite scoring in stoppage time of extra time to make it 1\u20131. Both of the under-19 and under-17 teams reached the semi finals of their SFL Youth Cups in 2006. The under-19 team finished runners-up behind Celtic in the inaugural SPFL under-19 league in 2014.The under-19 team travelled to the Netherlands in 2003, taking part in a highly rated youth football programme called the Leonardo Project hosted by FC Dordrecht. They played three times against an under-19 team of the hosts, which contained Dutch youth internationalists, winning two and drawing one. In the third match, the opposition was made up of reserves and first team fringe players. They followed this up with a win over local amateur team vv Capelle and a narrow defeat to a youthful FC Utrecht team.The Lanarkshire FA started the Lanarkshire Supercounty Trophy for all four senior Lanarkshire clubs' under-17 teams in 2013. Clyde beat Motherwell in the semi final, but lost to Accies in the final. The under-17's also reached their sectional League Cup final in 2017. The Community Foundation youth teams reached Divisional Cup finals in 2018 and 2019.From the 2018\u201319 season, Clyde have replaced their Under 20 side with a project alongside North Lanarkshire Council called Project Braver, which will see young players play at youth level with a chance to progress to the first team, alongside providing further education or apprenticeship opportunities for the players.\n\n\n==== Graduates ====\nGraduates of the youth team who have gone on to play for the first team since moving to Broadwood Stadium include:\n\nScottish internationals Pat Nevin, Steve Archibald and Ian Ferguson also came through the Clyde youth system.\n\n\n== Hall of Fame ==\n\nThe club launched its official Hall of Fame in 2011, with five inaugural inductees. Three more were inducted in 2012. The Clyde team of season 1966\u201367 was inducted in 2014. There was one inducted in 2015.

The club was admitted to the Scottish Football League and renamed as Meadowbank Thistle in 1974, and played its matches at Meadowbank Stadium in Edinburgh. In 1995, the club was relocated to Livingston, West Lothian and renamed after the town. Since then Livingston have played their home games at Almondvale Stadium. In the ten years following the move to Livingston the club enjoyed notable success, winning promotion to the Scottish Premier League in 2001, qualifying for the UEFA Cup in its maiden season in the top flight (finishing third behind Celtic and Rangers) and winning the 2004 Scottish League Cup. However, the club hit financial problems in 2004, and was relegated to the Scottish First Division in 2006. In July 2009 the club faced further financial problems and were on the verge of suffering a liquidation event before a deal was struck. Livingston were subsequently demoted to the Scottish Third Division, but the club achieved consecutive promotions and went on to regain its place in the top tier after winning the 2017\u201318 Scottish Premiership play-offs.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Ferranti Thistle (1943\u20131974) ===\nThe club began life as Ferranti Amateurs in 1943. A works team of the Ferranti engineering company, they initially played in the Edinburgh FA's Amateur Second Division. In 1948 the club became known as Ferranti Thistle and began competing in the Edinburgh and District Welfare Association where they competed for five seasons, before moving to senior football in 1953 joining the East of Scotland League. During this period the club won the East of Scotland Qualifying Cup in 1963.  In 1969 the club moved to the City Park ground in Edinburgh.In 1972 the club became members of SFA which allowed them to enter the Scottish Qualifying Cup which they won in 1973 which previously had not been open to them. The club's first match in the Scottish Cup was on 16 December 1972 against Duns.In 1974, as a result of the demise of Third Lanark seven years earlier, and the new three-tier format of the Scottish Football League, a place opened up in the second division of the competition. After beating off competition from four Highland League sides, Hawick Royal Albert and Gateshead United, Ferranti Thistle were accepted into the league by a vote of 21\u201316 over Inverness Thistle. The club faced a number of obstacles before they could join the Division as their name did not meet stringent SFL rules on overt sponsorship of teams at the time and the City Ground was not up to standard. The local council offered use of Meadowbank Stadium, a modern stadium built in 1970. After an Edinburgh Evening News campaign to find a name for the club, the name Meadowbank Thistle was chosen. This was approved by the SFL in time for the new season.\n\n\n=== Meadowbank Thistle (1974\u20131995) ===\n Having had little time to form a squad from the existing Ferranti squad, the first Meadowbank Thistle manager John Bain faced an uphill task to produce a competitive squad in time for the new season. Meadowbank played their first competitive match in the League Cup, eventually losing 1\u20130 to Albion Rovers. In 1983 the club achieved promotion to the First Division but ultimately were relegated back to the Second Division at the end of the 1984\u201385 season.In the 1986\u201387 season, Meadowbank won the Second Division championship and won promotion to the First Division. They finished runners-up in the First Division in the following season, but were denied promotion to the Premier Division due to league reconstruction.The part-time club began to struggle, and it became a limited company in 1993 but was relegated a short time after at the end of the 1992\u201393 season to the Second Division. Meadowbank suffered a second relegation in 1994\u201395, finishing second from bottom in the Second Division and due to the creation of a Third Division were relegated. After this, Chairman Bill Hunter claimed Meadowbank had run into severe financial difficulties and were facing closure as a result. In the face of significant opposition from many Meadowbank fans who objected to the dropping of the club name and the team moving from Edinburgh, in 1995 Meadowbank Thistle relocated to a new stadium in the new town of Livingston and changed name again, to Livingston Football Club.\n\n\n=== Livingston (1995\u2013) ===\n\n\n==== Rise to prominence ====\nIn their first season as Livingston they were crowned champions of the Third Division for the 1995\u201396 season. Three years later, in 1998\u201399, they won promotion again as Second Division champions. Another promotion followed in 2000\u201301 when the club finished champions of First Division and gained promotion to the Scottish Premier League (SPL), just six seasons after the relocation to Livingston. Livingston's first SPL campaign, 2001\u201302, brought more success as they finished third in the league (behind the Old Firm) and qualified for the UEFA Cup for the first time. Jim Leishman's side gave a competent showing in the UEFA Cup. After disposing of FC Vaduz of Liechtenstein on the away goal rule after a 1\u20131 draw, they came up against SK Sturm Graz of Austria, and after a 14-goal, two-leg affair they missed out on the second round, going out on the wrong side of an 8\u20136 aggregate scoreline. The club avoided relegation the following season finishing 9th. After this season, manager Jim Leishman became the club's director of football and was replaced by Brazilian manager M\u00e1rcio M\u00e1ximo, who resigned only a few months into the following campaign and was in turn replaced by Leishman's former assistant, Davie Hay. Under Hay's management, Livingston won their first national trophy in 2004 by winning the 2003\u201304 League Cup after a 2\u20130 win over Hibernian at Hampden Park. The goals in the final were scored by Derek Lilley and Jamie McAllister.\n\n\n==== Administration and SPL relegation ====\nThe club's rise was short-lived as they were plunged into administration on 3 February 2004. It was 13 May 2005 before Livingston emerged from administration, following a period of financial turmoil in which the previous boardroom occupants were ousted to make way for Pearse Flynn's Lionheart Consortium. Flynn's first decision was to sack Davie Hay, stating that he wanted a younger man in charge, and to that end appointed Allan Preston as the club's new manager. While Preston's term as Livingston manager started brightly with a 3\u20130 win over newly promoted Inverness Caledonian Thistle, the club failed to win another league game under his management, resulting in his dismissal in November with the club rooted to the bottom of the SPL. Richard Gough succeeded Preston and steered the club to survival on the last day of the season with a 1\u20131 draw with Dundee that relegated Dundee in their place, but Gough refused to stay as manager past the end of that season due to family problems and returned to the US, and former Celtic player Paul Lambert succeeded him. On 11 February 2006, Lambert resigned as Livingston manager after seven straight defeats leaving Livingston bottom of the Scottish Premier League. He was replaced by former player and coach John Robertson. Despite his best efforts, Livingston were relegated for the first time in May 2006 after only picking up 18 points that season. It was the worst record since the SPL began and was only beaten during the 2007\u201308 season by Gretna, after they were deducted 10 points for going into administration.\n\n\n==== First Division and second administration ====\nA poor showing in the 2006\u201307 First Division saw John Robertson removed as Livingston manager on 15 April 2007. His successor was announced on 22 May 2007 as former Hibernian assistant coach Mark Proctor. Proctor appointed Curtis Fleming as his assistant on 26 June 2007, but both were sacked in June 2008 after a disappointing season in which they finished seventh. Livingston were taken over that summer by Italian majority shareholders Angelo Massone, Tommaso Bruno, Alessandro Di Mattia, and Tommaso Angelini after Pearse Flynn sold his shares in June 2008. The Italians were thought to be close to appointing fellow Italian Roberto Landi as head coach in June and he was made manager of the First Division side on 11 June 2008. He and assistant Valter Berlini were then fired on 1 December 2008 after just five months in charge. Paul Hegarty was linked with the job on 3 December 2008, and formally appointed two days later. Hegarty was subsequently suspended as manager on 26 April 2009 and his contract allowed to expire.John Murphy was appointed head coach on 30 June 2009, the same day the club faced a deadline to pay debt to West Lothian Council who owned Almondvale Stadium. After that was not met, legal proceedings were carried out against the club to come to an arrangement over the debt within fourteen days or potentially face again going into administration. Livingston were placed into administration on 24 July 2009 by the Court of Session in Edinburgh, and faced relegation to the Third Division, a points deduction or being removed from the Scottish Football League entirely.\nOn 27 July 2009, it was revealed that the club were likely to go into liquidation after owner Angelo Massone said he would refuse a \u00a325,000 offer for the club from their administrator. On 28 July 2009, Massone yet again refused the offer and the administrator subsequently started the liquidation process. While Livingston seemed doomed, a meeting with the Scottish Football League on 30 July 2009 secured their future, as they agreed to allow prospective new owners Gordon McDougall and Neil Rankine (part of the Livingston 5 Consortium) to run the club for the following season. The next day, Massone sold his shares to the new owners and left the club, and it was also announced that John Murphy had been appointed back to his previous role as goalkeeping coach, with ex-player Gary Bollan becoming the club's new manager. In the first game after the new owners took over, Livingston were on the wrong end of a cup shock in the Scottish League Cup first round, losing 3\u20130 to Albion Rovers, a team two divisions below them.\n\n\n==== Demotion to the Third Division ====\nDespite the prospective new owners ensuring that Livingston's future as a professional football club would be secure for the next year at least by paying a \u00a3720,000 bond to the SFL, on 5 August 2009 the Scottish Football League took the unprecedented move to demote Livingston to the Third Division. A breach of rules on insolvency was the main reason behind the decision. The administrator of the club, Donald McGruther, admitted his concern after the decision, saying that \"In my view, this represents the death knell of Livingston Football Club\". Gordon McDougall, a member of the Livingston 5 Consortium stated that \"We've got to consider all the options that are open to us \u2013 it makes it very, very difficult\". It was feared that the club could not survive in the Third Division due to a significant loss of revenue. However, despite the decision and the likely financial impacts, the consortium continued with their bid to take over the club. An appeal was lodged and as a result the club refused to play their opening Division Three fixture against East Stirlingshire on 8 August 2009. Because of this, the club were threatened with a points deduction, but in the event they were given a \u00a33,000 fine for their actions. This was later overturned on appeal, meaning that the club ultimately escaped any punishment for their boycott of the match. On 7 September 2009 a further appeal to the SFA was dismissed, and the club finally accepted their Third Division fate.\n\n\n==== Title wins and First Division return ====\nOn 15 August 2009, Livingston opened their Third Division campaign against Montrose at home and ran out comfortable 2\u20130 winners. On 17 April 2010, Livingston won the Scottish Third Division title after drawing 0\u20130 at home to Berwick Rangers. Goalkeeper Roddy McKenzie saved a last minute penalty to ensure the title was on its way to Almondvale. The Lions ended the season on 78 points, 15 points ahead of second placed Forfar Athletic. The following season on 9 April 2011, Livingston secured the Second Division title with a second consecutive title win to earn promotion back to the Scottish First Division with a 3\u20130 victory over Stenhousemuir at Ochilview Park. On 9 February 2012, Bollan was sacked as manager after two and a half years in charge. Nine days later on 14 February 2012, John Hughes and John Collins were appointed as manager and director of football respectively. However, on 13 November 2012, it was announced that Hughes had left the club to take charge of Hartlepool United. Gareth Evans became manager after being promoted from his position as assistant manager but he was sacked on 28 February 2013 due to \u2018concerns over his stewardship\u2019. Collins subsequently resigned from his position as director of football. On 25 March 2013, Richie Burke was appointed as manager along with Mark Burchill as assistant manager. Livingston ended season 2012\u201313 with a 4th-place finish in the First Division, their highest league finish since they were relegated from the SPL in 2006. On 12 September 2013, Burke resigned from his post as manager and was subsequently replaced by John McGlynn. When McGlynn took over Livingston were bottom of the Scottish Championship with only 1 point. Improved performances under his leadership took the club into contention for the promotion play-offs. As a result he was awarded an extended contract in January 2014. Livingston eventually finished in 6th place in 2013\u201314.\nHowever Livingston struggled the following season and were in severe danger of relegation. McGlynn left Livingston by mutual consent in December 2014, following a 1\u20130 home defeat by Falkirk, which left the club bottom of the league, four points behind second bottom Cowdenbeath. Mark Burchill replaced McGlynn as the club's manager. Off the field problems also once again plagued the club during this season. The club were deducted 5 points by the SPFL for failing to pay tax on bonuses paid during the 2010\u201311 season. Former club director Ged Nixon tried to get the courts to freeze the clubs bank accounts as he claimed the club owed him \u00a3300,000. This sparked fears that the club would go into administration for a third time. Nixon lost his court case in April 2015, saving the club from this fate. Livingston won the 2014\u201315 Scottish Challenge Cup, defeating Alloa 4-0 in the final at McDiarmid Park. With two games of the season remaining Livingston were still adrift at the bottom of the league, three points behind relegation rivals Alloa and four behind Cowdenbeath. A 4\u20130 win away at Raith Rovers moved the club into 9th place on goal difference going into the final game of the season. Livingston won their final game of the season 1\u20130 at home to Queen of the South to pull off the great escape and finish in 8th place, avoiding both automatic relegation and the relegation play-off.Livingston were struggling against relegation again in season 2015\u201316. Burchill was sacked in December 2015 following a 1\u20131 draw with Dumbarton as Livingston sat second bottom of the league. David Hopkin replaced him as manager. However there was to be no great escape this season. Livingston finished in 9th place in the Championship, which meant they had to contest the Championship Play-Off to avoid relegation to Scottish League One. They faced Stranraer in the play-off semi-final. Livingston lost the first leg 5\u20132 away at Stranraer, giving themselves a very difficult task for the second leg. In the second leg Livingston won 4\u20131 in 90 minutes to take the tie to extra time. However two extra time Stranraer goals took the score to 4\u20133 on the day and 6\u20138 on aggregate, confirming Livingston's relegation to League One, ending a five year stint in the second tier.\n\n\n==== League One and consecutive promotions ====\nDespite relegation, Livingston decided to stay as a full-time football club, and David Hopkin was retained as manager for the 2016\u201317 season, as Livingston aimed to bounce back to the Championship. Livingston went on to win the league comfortably and secured the title in April 2017 following a 2\u20131 win at home to Alloa Athletic. Livingston finished 19 points clear at the top of the league.\nLivingston continued this impressive form into the Championship in 2017\u201318 and sat in the play-off places in joint 3rd in the league after 20 games. The club also reached the quarter-finals of the Scottish League Cup, where they were unlucky to go down 3\u20132 at Hibernian. It was the first time they reached this stage of the league cup since 2005\u201306.\nOn 21 April 2018 Livingston secured second place in the Championship after a 3\u20130 win over already relegated Brechin City.\nQualifying for the Premiership play-off final, they faced Partick Thistle, who escaped automatic relegation in their final game. Despite this, Livingston won 3\u20131 on aggregate, 2\u20131 at home and 1\u20130 away, earning the final place in the Scottish Premiership and their first season of top-flight football since 2006, relegating Partick Thistle to the Championship in the process, ending Thistle's five-year stint in the Premiership.\n\n\n==== Scottish Premiership ====\nLivingston retained their status as a top flight club in season 2018\u201319 with a 9th place finish. This was bettered the following season with the club sitting in 5th before the season was curtailed as a result of COVID-19. The points per game ruling confirmed this placing as Livi's first top 6 finish since 2001\u201302. In 2020-21, the feat was repeated with a sixth place finish. The season was also notable for the club reaching the Scottish League Cup final for the first time since 2004.\n\n\n== Colours and badge ==\nThe predominant club colours are amber and black, which have been used since the formation of the club in 1943. The strip typically has an amber top, with the shorts normally black and the socks amber, usually with some black detail. The original strip for the club during the first couple of season in the Ferranti Thistle era was amber and black hoops. After this, solid amber shirts, black shorts and amber socks (occasionally black) became established as the club's home kit. During the recent Livingston era the club have also used all black home strips, and a white and orange kit was used during 2002\u201303 season. The colours of white, black, purple, blue and red have been mainly used in the away strips.The badge used to identify the club has changed four times in the club's history. The Ferranti Thistle badge featured a black circular base. Three symbols were incorporated into the badge; a football, a thistle and a lion rampant in the centre holding aloft a Scottish flag. A new badge was then formed as the club changed their name to Meadowbank Thistle. The badge was based on a traditional shield shape with a black being the predominant colour and amber on the outer-trim. The badge features a thistle as the centre piece, with the flower part of the plant being replaced with a football. As the club moved to Livingston, the badge was changed again. The design of the thistle and the football is altered slightly; with the one major change being the addition of a Latin club motto \"Fortitier omnia vincit\" with the English translation meaning \"Bravely conquers all\". The current badge is modernised from the original Livingston badge but most of the features remain. The present badge also reintroduced the lion rampant in the centre of the laurel.\n\n\n== Sponsorship ==\nIn the Meadowbank Thistle era between 1973 and 1995, the club sourced various shirt sponsorship deals largely from small business such as Ferranti, Sports Conscious, Park & Milton, Raj Restaurant, ACA and PAR Scaffolding. Mitsubishi became the first major shirt sponsor of the club for the first three seasons of the Livingston era. Motorola then sponsored the club for the next four years. However, Motorola withdrew their shirt sponsorship at the end of the 2001\u201302 season, after the company\u2019s decline in the area. In 2002, Intelligent Finance, one of the largest employers in the West Lothian area, agreed an initial two-year sponsorship deal with the club worth an undisclosed six-figure sum. The company extended their shirt sponsorship for three more years, making their total sponsorship span over a five-year period.Smarter Loans became the club's main sponsor during the 2007\u201308 season, before the IT solutions company, RDF, signed a two-year deal to become main sponsors for seasons 2008\u201309 and 2009\u201310. However they withdrew their sponsorship after only one year, as a result of the ongoing financial crisis at the club that summer. Local supply chain solutions company Fasteq became the new main sponsor for season 2009\u201310 after the arrival of the new club owners. After four successful years as sponsors, Fasteq withdrew their sponsorship and Livingston announced that they were looking for new shirt sponsors for season 2013\u201314. Local business  Energy Assets were confirmed as new main sponsors on a three-year deal in June 2013.\n\n\n== Stadiums ==\n\nThe club have had three main grounds in their history; as Ferranti Thistle, the club initially played in local parks before finding a home at City Park in Edinburgh in 1969, then moving to Meadowbank Stadium in 1974 which was built for the 1970 Commonwealth Games.Livingston currently play their home games at the Almondvale Stadium in Livingston. It is currently known as the Tony Macaroni Arena due to a sponsorship deal. The 9,512 capacity stadium was constructed in 1995 as a joint venture between Meadowbank Thistle and the Livingston Development Corporation (LDC). Part of the deal involved the relocation of Meadowbank Thistle to the town and a name change to Livingston. When the LDC was wound up, ownership of the Stadium was transferred to West Lothian Council and the council have since rented the stadium to the club. The ground has hosted Scotland under-21, under-19, under-17s and Ladies matches, as well as one home game for Gretna due to problems with their ground share at Fir Park. In April 2011 it was revealed that it was possible Livingston would relocate to a new stadium around one mile from the current site due to West Lothian Council looking to sell the current site to a supermarket chain.\n\n\n== Players ==\n\n\n=== First-team squad ===\nAs of 31 January 2022Note: Flags indicate national team as defined under FIFA eligibility rules.

They have qualified for a UEFA club competition on one occasion. The club finished third in the Scottish Premier League (behind Celtic and Rangers) in season 2001\u201302 and hence qualified for a place in the UEFA Cup for the following season. They entered at the qualifying round stage and were drawn against FC Vaduz of Liechtenstein. Livingston narrowly overcame their opponents after drawing 1\u20131 on aggregate, going through to the next round on the away goals rule. After drawing the home leg 0\u20130 Oscar Rubio scored the decisive away goal. In the following round they were drawn against Austrian side SK Sturm Graz. They were defeated 8\u20136 on aggregate, losing the first leg 5\u20132 in Austria at the Arnold Schwarzenegger Stadium before winning the return leg 4\u20133 at Almondvale. Barry Wilson scored two goals against Sturm Graz, making him Livingston\u2019s highest goalscorer in European competitions to date.\n\n\n== See also ==\nRelocation of professional sports teams\nWorks team\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nLivi for Life Supporters Trust", "infobox": {"clubname": "Livingston", "image": "Livingston FC club badge new.png", "upright": ".8", "fullname": "Livingston Football Club", "nickname": "Livi, The Lions", "founded": "{{Start date and age|df|=|yes|1943}} (as Ferranti Thistle)", "ground": "[[Almondvale Stadium]], [[Livingston, West Lothian|Livingston]]", "capacity": "9,512", "owner": "Opcco6 Ltd", "chairman": "Robert Wilson", "manager": "[[David Martindale]]", "league": "{{Scottish football updater|Livingst}}", "season": "{{Scottish football updater|Livingst2}}", "position": "{{Scottish football updater|Livingst3}}", "pattern_b1": "_livingston2122h", "leftarm1": "000000", "body1": "000000", "rightarm1": "000000", "shorts1": "000000", "socks1": "000000", "pattern_b2": "_livingston2122a", "website": "https://livingstonfc.co.uk", "current": "2021\u201322 Livingston F.C. season"}, "wikidata": {"instance of (P31)": "association football club (Q476028)", "home venue (P115)": "Almondvale Stadium (Q1309785)", "league (P118)": ["Scottish Championship (Q14468438)", "Scottish Premiership (Q14377162)"], "topic's main category (P910)": "Category:Livingston F.C.

The club was admitted to the Scottish Football League and renamed as Meadowbank Thistle in 1974, and played its matches at Meadowbank Stadium in Edinburgh. In 1995, the club was relocated to Livingston, West Lothian and renamed after the town. Since then Livingston have played their home games at Almondvale Stadium. In the ten years following the move to Livingston the club enjoyed notable success, winning promotion to the Scottish Premier League in 2001, qualifying for the UEFA Cup in its maiden season in the top flight (finishing third behind Celtic and Rangers) and winning the 2004 Scottish League Cup. However, the club hit financial problems in 2004, and was relegated to the Scottish First Division in 2006. In July 2009 the club faced further financial problems and were on the verge of suffering a liquidation event before a deal was struck. Livingston were subsequently demoted to the Scottish Third Division, but the club achieved consecutive promotions and went on to regain its place in the top tier after winning the 2017\u201318 Scottish Premiership play-offs.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Ferranti Thistle (1943\u20131974) ===\nThe club began life as Ferranti Amateurs in 1943. A works team of the Ferranti engineering company, they initially played in the Edinburgh FA's Amateur Second Division. In 1948 the club became known as Ferranti Thistle and began competing in the Edinburgh and District Welfare Association where they competed for five seasons, before moving to senior football in 1953 joining the East of Scotland League. During this period the club won the East of Scotland Qualifying Cup in 1963.  In 1969 the club moved to the City Park ground in Edinburgh.In 1972 the club became members of SFA which allowed them to enter the Scottish Qualifying Cup which they won in 1973 which previously had not been open to them. The club's first match in the Scottish Cup was on 16 December 1972 against Duns.In 1974, as a result of the demise of Third Lanark seven years earlier, and the new three-tier format of the Scottish Football League, a place opened up in the second division of the competition. After beating off competition from four Highland League sides, Hawick Royal Albert and Gateshead United, Ferranti Thistle were accepted into the league by a vote of 21\u201316 over Inverness Thistle. The club faced a number of obstacles before they could join the Division as their name did not meet stringent SFL rules on overt sponsorship of teams at the time and the City Ground was not up to standard. The local council offered use of Meadowbank Stadium, a modern stadium built in 1970. After an Edinburgh Evening News campaign to find a name for the club, the name Meadowbank Thistle was chosen. This was approved by the SFL in time for the new season.\n\n\n=== Meadowbank Thistle (1974\u20131995) ===\n Having had little time to form a squad from the existing Ferranti squad, the first Meadowbank Thistle manager John Bain faced an uphill task to produce a competitive squad in time for the new season. Meadowbank played their first competitive match in the League Cup, eventually losing 1\u20130 to Albion Rovers. In 1983 the club achieved promotion to the First Division but ultimately were relegated back to the Second Division at the end of the 1984\u201385 season.In the 1986\u201387 season, Meadowbank won the Second Division championship and won promotion to the First Division. They finished runners-up in the First Division in the following season, but were denied promotion to the Premier Division due to league reconstruction.The part-time club began to struggle, and it became a limited company in 1993 but was relegated a short time after at the end of the 1992\u201393 season to the Second Division. Meadowbank suffered a second relegation in 1994\u201395, finishing second from bottom in the Second Division and due to the creation of a Third Division were relegated. After this, Chairman Bill Hunter claimed Meadowbank had run into severe financial difficulties and were facing closure as a result. In the face of significant opposition from many Meadowbank fans who objected to the dropping of the club name and the team moving from Edinburgh, in 1995 Meadowbank Thistle relocated to a new stadium in the new town of Livingston and changed name again, to Livingston Football Club.\n\n\n=== Livingston (1995\u2013) ===\n\n\n==== Rise to prominence ====\nIn their first season as Livingston they were crowned champions of the Third Division for the 1995\u201396 season. Three years later, in 1998\u201399, they won promotion again as Second Division champions. Another promotion followed in 2000\u201301 when the club finished champions of First Division and gained promotion to the Scottish Premier League (SPL), just six seasons after the relocation to Livingston. Livingston's first SPL campaign, 2001\u201302, brought more success as they finished third in the league (behind the Old Firm) and qualified for the UEFA Cup for the first time. Jim Leishman's side gave a competent showing in the UEFA Cup. After disposing of FC Vaduz of Liechtenstein on the away goal rule after a 1\u20131 draw, they came up against SK Sturm Graz of Austria, and after a 14-goal, two-leg affair they missed out on the second round, going out on the wrong side of an 8\u20136 aggregate scoreline. The club avoided relegation the following season finishing 9th. After this season, manager Jim Leishman became the club's director of football and was replaced by Brazilian manager M\u00e1rcio M\u00e1ximo, who resigned only a few months into the following campaign and was in turn replaced by Leishman's former assistant, Davie Hay. Under Hay's management, Livingston won their first national trophy in 2004 by winning the 2003\u201304 League Cup after a 2\u20130 win over Hibernian at Hampden Park. The goals in the final were scored by Derek Lilley and Jamie McAllister.\n\n\n==== Administration and SPL relegation ====\nThe club's rise was short-lived as they were plunged into administration on 3 February 2004. It was 13 May 2005 before Livingston emerged from administration, following a period of financial turmoil in which the previous boardroom occupants were ousted to make way for Pearse Flynn's Lionheart Consortium. Flynn's first decision was to sack Davie Hay, stating that he wanted a younger man in charge, and to that end appointed Allan Preston as the club's new manager. While Preston's term as Livingston manager started brightly with a 3\u20130 win over newly promoted Inverness Caledonian Thistle, the club failed to win another league game under his management, resulting in his dismissal in November with the club rooted to the bottom of the SPL. Richard Gough succeeded Preston and steered the club to survival on the last day of the season with a 1\u20131 draw with Dundee that relegated Dundee in their place, but Gough refused to stay as manager past the end of that season due to family problems and returned to the US, and former Celtic player Paul Lambert succeeded him. On 11 February 2006, Lambert resigned as Livingston manager after seven straight defeats leaving Livingston bottom of the Scottish Premier League. He was replaced by former player and coach John Robertson. Despite his best efforts, Livingston were relegated for the first time in May 2006 after only picking up 18 points that season. It was the worst record since the SPL began and was only beaten during the 2007\u201308 season by Gretna, after they were deducted 10 points for going into administration.\n\n\n==== First Division and second administration ====\nA poor showing in the 2006\u201307 First Division saw John Robertson removed as Livingston manager on 15 April 2007. His successor was announced on 22 May 2007 as former Hibernian assistant coach Mark Proctor. Proctor appointed Curtis Fleming as his assistant on 26 June 2007, but both were sacked in June 2008 after a disappointing season in which they finished seventh. Livingston were taken over that summer by Italian majority shareholders Angelo Massone, Tommaso Bruno, Alessandro Di Mattia, and Tommaso Angelini after Pearse Flynn sold his shares in June 2008. The Italians were thought to be close to appointing fellow Italian Roberto Landi as head coach in June and he was made manager of the First Division side on 11 June 2008. He and assistant Valter Berlini were then fired on 1 December 2008 after just five months in charge. Paul Hegarty was linked with the job on 3 December 2008, and formally appointed two days later. Hegarty was subsequently suspended as manager on 26 April 2009 and his contract allowed to expire.John Murphy was appointed head coach on 30 June 2009, the same day the club faced a deadline to pay debt to West Lothian Council who owned Almondvale Stadium. After that was not met, legal proceedings were carried out against the club to come to an arrangement over the debt within fourteen days or potentially face again going into administration. Livingston were placed into administration on 24 July 2009 by the Court of Session in Edinburgh, and faced relegation to the Third Division, a points deduction or being removed from the Scottish Football League entirely.\nOn 27 July 2009, it was revealed that the club were likely to go into liquidation after owner Angelo Massone said he would refuse a \u00a325,000 offer for the club from their administrator. On 28 July 2009, Massone yet again refused the offer and the administrator subsequently started the liquidation process. While Livingston seemed doomed, a meeting with the Scottish Football League on 30 July 2009 secured their future, as they agreed to allow prospective new owners Gordon McDougall and Neil Rankine (part of the Livingston 5 Consortium) to run the club for the following season. The next day, Massone sold his shares to the new owners and left the club, and it was also announced that John Murphy had been appointed back to his previous role as goalkeeping coach, with ex-player Gary Bollan becoming the club's new manager. In the first game after the new owners took over, Livingston were on the wrong end of a cup shock in the Scottish League Cup first round, losing 3\u20130 to Albion Rovers, a team two divisions below them.\n\n\n==== Demotion to the Third Division ====\nDespite the prospective new owners ensuring that Livingston's future as a professional football club would be secure for the next year at least by paying a \u00a3720,000 bond to the SFL, on 5 August 2009 the Scottish Football League took the unprecedented move to demote Livingston to the Third Division. A breach of rules on insolvency was the main reason behind the decision. The administrator of the club, Donald McGruther, admitted his concern after the decision, saying that \"In my view, this represents the death knell of Livingston Football Club\". Gordon McDougall, a member of the Livingston 5 Consortium stated that \"We've got to consider all the options that are open to us \u2013 it makes it very, very difficult\". It was feared that the club could not survive in the Third Division due to a significant loss of revenue. However, despite the decision and the likely financial impacts, the consortium continued with their bid to take over the club. An appeal was lodged and as a result the club refused to play their opening Division Three fixture against East Stirlingshire on 8 August 2009. Because of this, the club were threatened with a points deduction, but in the event they were given a \u00a33,000 fine for their actions. This was later overturned on appeal, meaning that the club ultimately escaped any punishment for their boycott of the match. On 7 September 2009 a further appeal to the SFA was dismissed, and the club finally accepted their Third Division fate.\n\n\n==== Title wins and First Division return ====\nOn 15 August 2009, Livingston opened their Third Division campaign against Montrose at home and ran out comfortable 2\u20130 winners. On 17 April 2010, Livingston won the Scottish Third Division title after drawing 0\u20130 at home to Berwick Rangers. Goalkeeper Roddy McKenzie saved a last minute penalty to ensure the title was on its way to Almondvale. The Lions ended the season on 78 points, 15 points ahead of second placed Forfar Athletic. The following season on 9 April 2011, Livingston secured the Second Division title with a second consecutive title win to earn promotion back to the Scottish First Division with a 3\u20130 victory over Stenhousemuir at Ochilview Park. On 9 February 2012, Bollan was sacked as manager after two and a half years in charge. Nine days later on 14 February 2012, John Hughes and John Collins were appointed as manager and director of football respectively. However, on 13 November 2012, it was announced that Hughes had left the club to take charge of Hartlepool United. Gareth Evans became manager after being promoted from his position as assistant manager but he was sacked on 28 February 2013 due to \u2018concerns over his stewardship\u2019. Collins subsequently resigned from his position as director of football. On 25 March 2013, Richie Burke was appointed as manager along with Mark Burchill as assistant manager. Livingston ended season 2012\u201313 with a 4th-place finish in the First Division, their highest league finish since they were relegated from the SPL in 2006. On 12 September 2013, Burke resigned from his post as manager and was subsequently replaced by John McGlynn. When McGlynn took over Livingston were bottom of the Scottish Championship with only 1 point. Improved performances under his leadership took the club into contention for the promotion play-offs. As a result he was awarded an extended contract in January 2014. Livingston eventually finished in 6th place in 2013\u201314.\nHowever Livingston struggled the following season and were in severe danger of relegation. McGlynn left Livingston by mutual consent in December 2014, following a 1\u20130 home defeat by Falkirk, which left the club bottom of the league, four points behind second bottom Cowdenbeath. Mark Burchill replaced McGlynn as the club's manager. Off the field problems also once again plagued the club during this season. The club were deducted 5 points by the SPFL for failing to pay tax on bonuses paid during the 2010\u201311 season. Former club director Ged Nixon tried to get the courts to freeze the clubs bank accounts as he claimed the club owed him \u00a3300,000. This sparked fears that the club would go into administration for a third time. Nixon lost his court case in April 2015, saving the club from this fate. Livingston won the 2014\u201315 Scottish Challenge Cup, defeating Alloa 4-0 in the final at McDiarmid Park. With two games of the season remaining Livingston were still adrift at the bottom of the league, three points behind relegation rivals Alloa and four behind Cowdenbeath. A 4\u20130 win away at Raith Rovers moved the club into 9th place on goal difference going into the final game of the season. Livingston won their final game of the season 1\u20130 at home to Queen of the South to pull off the great escape and finish in 8th place, avoiding both automatic relegation and the relegation play-off.Livingston were struggling against relegation again in season 2015\u201316. Burchill was sacked in December 2015 following a 1\u20131 draw with Dumbarton as Livingston sat second bottom of the league. David Hopkin replaced him as manager. However there was to be no great escape this season. Livingston finished in 9th place in the Championship, which meant they had to contest the Championship Play-Off to avoid relegation to Scottish League One. They faced Stranraer in the play-off semi-final. Livingston lost the first leg 5\u20132 away at Stranraer, giving themselves a very difficult task for the second leg. In the second leg Livingston won 4\u20131 in 90 minutes to take the tie to extra time. However two extra time Stranraer goals took the score to 4\u20133 on the day and 6\u20138 on aggregate, confirming Livingston's relegation to League One, ending a five year stint in the second tier.\n\n\n==== League One and consecutive promotions ====\nDespite relegation, Livingston decided to stay as a full-time football club, and David Hopkin was retained as manager for the 2016\u201317 season, as Livingston aimed to bounce back to the Championship. Livingston went on to win the league comfortably and secured the title in April 2017 following a 2\u20131 win at home to Alloa Athletic. Livingston finished 19 points clear at the top of the league.\nLivingston continued this impressive form into the Championship in 2017\u201318 and sat in the play-off places in joint 3rd in the league after 20 games. The club also reached the quarter-finals of the Scottish League Cup, where they were unlucky to go down 3\u20132 at Hibernian. It was the first time they reached this stage of the league cup since 2005\u201306.\nOn 21 April 2018 Livingston secured second place in the Championship after a 3\u20130 win over already relegated Brechin City.\nQualifying for the Premiership play-off final, they faced Partick Thistle, who escaped automatic relegation in their final game. Despite this, Livingston won 3\u20131 on aggregate, 2\u20131 at home and 1\u20130 away, earning the final place in the Scottish Premiership and their first season of top-flight football since 2006, relegating Partick Thistle to the Championship in the process, ending Thistle's five-year stint in the Premiership.\n\n\n==== Scottish Premiership ====\nLivingston retained their status as a top flight club in season 2018\u201319 with a 9th place finish. This was bettered the following season with the club sitting in 5th before the season was curtailed as a result of COVID-19. The points per game ruling confirmed this placing as Livi's first top 6 finish since 2001\u201302. In 2020-21, the feat was repeated with a sixth place finish. The season was also notable for the club reaching the Scottish League Cup final for the first time since 2004.\n\n\n== Colours and badge ==\nThe predominant club colours are amber and black, which have been used since the formation of the club in 1943. The strip typically has an amber top, with the shorts normally black and the socks amber, usually with some black detail. The original strip for the club during the first couple of season in the Ferranti Thistle era was amber and black hoops. After this, solid amber shirts, black shorts and amber socks (occasionally black) became established as the club's home kit. During the recent Livingston era the club have also used all black home strips, and a white and orange kit was used during 2002\u201303 season. The colours of white, black, purple, blue and red have been mainly used in the away strips.The badge used to identify the club has changed four times in the club's history. The Ferranti Thistle badge featured a black circular base. Three symbols were incorporated into the badge; a football, a thistle and a lion rampant in the centre holding aloft a Scottish flag. A new badge was then formed as the club changed their name to Meadowbank Thistle. The badge was based on a traditional shield shape with a black being the predominant colour and amber on the outer-trim. The badge features a thistle as the centre piece, with the flower part of the plant being replaced with a football. As the club moved to Livingston, the badge was changed again. The design of the thistle and the football is altered slightly; with the one major change being the addition of a Latin club motto \"Fortitier omnia vincit\" with the English translation meaning \"Bravely conquers all\". The current badge is modernised from the original Livingston badge but most of the features remain. The present badge also reintroduced the lion rampant in the centre of the laurel.\n\n\n== Sponsorship ==\nIn the Meadowbank Thistle era between 1973 and 1995, the club sourced various shirt sponsorship deals largely from small business such as Ferranti, Sports Conscious, Park & Milton, Raj Restaurant, ACA and PAR Scaffolding. Mitsubishi became the first major shirt sponsor of the club for the first three seasons of the Livingston era. Motorola then sponsored the club for the next four years. However, Motorola withdrew their shirt sponsorship at the end of the 2001\u201302 season, after the company\u2019s decline in the area. In 2002, Intelligent Finance, one of the largest employers in the West Lothian area, agreed an initial two-year sponsorship deal with the club worth an undisclosed six-figure sum. The company extended their shirt sponsorship for three more years, making their total sponsorship span over a five-year period.Smarter Loans became the club's main sponsor during the 2007\u201308 season, before the IT solutions company, RDF, signed a two-year deal to become main sponsors for seasons 2008\u201309 and 2009\u201310. However they withdrew their sponsorship after only one year, as a result of the ongoing financial crisis at the club that summer. Local supply chain solutions company Fasteq became the new main sponsor for season 2009\u201310 after the arrival of the new club owners. After four successful years as sponsors, Fasteq withdrew their sponsorship and Livingston announced that they were looking for new shirt sponsors for season 2013\u201314. Local business  Energy Assets were confirmed as new main sponsors on a three-year deal in June 2013.\n\n\n== Stadiums ==\n\nThe club have had three main grounds in their history; as Ferranti Thistle, the club initially played in local parks before finding a home at City Park in Edinburgh in 1969, then moving to Meadowbank Stadium in 1974 which was built for the 1970 Commonwealth Games.Livingston currently play their home games at the Almondvale Stadium in Livingston. It is currently known as the Tony Macaroni Arena due to a sponsorship deal. The 9,512 capacity stadium was constructed in 1995 as a joint venture between Meadowbank Thistle and the Livingston Development Corporation (LDC). Part of the deal involved the relocation of Meadowbank Thistle to the town and a name change to Livingston. When the LDC was wound up, ownership of the Stadium was transferred to West Lothian Council and the council have since rented the stadium to the club. The ground has hosted Scotland under-21, under-19, under-17s and Ladies matches, as well as one home game for Gretna due to problems with their ground share at Fir Park. In April 2011 it was revealed that it was possible Livingston would relocate to a new stadium around one mile from the current site due to West Lothian Council looking to sell the current site to a supermarket chain.\n\n\n== Players ==\n\n\n=== First-team squad ===\nAs of 31 January 2022Note: Flags indicate national team as defined under FIFA eligibility rules.

They entered at the qualifying round stage and were drawn against FC Vaduz of Liechtenstein. Livingston narrowly overcame their opponents after drawing 1\u20131 on aggregate, going through to the next round on the away goals rule. After drawing the home leg 0\u20130 Oscar Rubio scored the decisive away goal. In the following round they were drawn against Austrian side SK Sturm Graz.

It ranks fourth in the number of national titles won (13), behind G\u00f3rnik Zabrze, Ruch Chorz\u00f3w (both on 14), and Legia Warsaw (15), and second in all-time victories. Wis\u0142a was founded in 1906 under the name TS Wis\u0142a (Polish: Towarzystwo Sportowe Wis\u0142a).\nThe club's coat of arms is a white star on a red background crossed by a blue ribbon.\nWis\u0142a Krak\u00f3w has been one of the most successful Polish football clubs in recent years, winning eight league championships since 1999. Along with league titles, Wis\u0142a also won the Polish Cup on four occasions. Wis\u0142a also enjoyed some success in European competitions in the 1970s, reaching the quarter-finals in the 1978\u201379 European Cup and winning the UEFA Intertoto Cup in 1969, 1970 and 1973.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nWis\u0142a Krak\u00f3w was founded in 1906 when students of the Second Practical School in Krak\u00f3w, inspired by their professor Tadeusz \u0141opusza\u0144ski, formed a football club.In this first, historic season of the League, the fight for the championship was decided between two teams: Wis\u0142a Krak\u00f3w and 1. FC Kattowitz. This rivalry was treated very seriously, not only by the two sides involved, but also by the whole nation. 1. FC was regarded as the team supported by the German minority, while Wis\u0142a, at the end of this historic season, represented ambitions of all Poles.\n\nSome time in the fall of 1927 in Katowice, an ill-fated game between 1.FC and Wis\u0142a took place. Stakes were very high \u2013 the winner would become the Champion. Krak\u00f3w's side won 2\u20130 and became the Champion. 1.FC finished second, third was Warta Pozna\u0144.\nIn 1949, the club was renamed to Gwardia-Wis\u0142a Krak\u00f3w. In 1955 the club returned to its original name, TS Wis\u0142a. In 1967, the club was once again renamed, to GTS Wis\u0142a, a name which held until 1990 when the club reverted to its original name, TS Wis\u0142a. In the late 1990s, the football section of the club was incorporated and was renamed Wis\u0142a Krak\u00f3w SSA.\nThe club has had its ups and downs, winning national championships and earning European qualification. It was also relegated to the second division on three occasions. Since the football section has been bought by Tele-Fonika Kable S.A. in 1998, the team has been far and away the most successful club in Poland, winning seven national championships and finishing in second place three times, totalling ten top two finishes in 12 years.\nAt international level, Wis\u0142a has competed in all three of the European competitions. The club's greatest success came in the 1978\u201379 season, when Wis\u0142a was able to reach the quarter-finals of the European Cup, eventually to be knocked out by Malm\u00f6 FF 3\u20135 on aggregate. Most recently, Wis\u0142a narrowly missed out on a chance to compete in the 2005\u201306 UEFA Champions League group stage, being defeated 4\u20135 by Panathinaikos after extra time.Wis\u0142a also twice reached the second round of the European Cup Winners' Cup in 1967\u201368 and 1984\u201385, falling 0\u20135 and 2\u20133 by Hamburger SV and Fortuna Sittard respectively.\nThe White Star has competed in the UEFA Cup ten times.\n\n\n== Stadium ==\n\nWis\u0142a's Stadium is located at 22 Reymonta Street in Krak\u00f3w. The stadium was originally built in 1953 and currently has a capacity of 33,326.  The stadium was renovated in 2010, being upgraded to UEFA elite standards. The Wis\u0142a Stadium was also chosen as a reserve venue for the UEFA Euro 2012 tournament, jointly held in Poland and Ukraine. The record attendance of 45,000 at Wis\u0142a Stadium came on 29 September 1976 when Wis\u0142a defeated Celtic 2\u20130. The venue has been a fortress for Wis\u0142a, where the team is especially difficult to defeat. It is worth noting that Wis\u0142a holds the all-time Polish football record for consecutive league home games without a loss. The streak began following a loss on 16 September 2001 to KSZO Ostrowiec \u015awi\u0119tokrzyski, and ended more than five years later on 11 November 2006, when GKS Be\u0142chat\u00f3w defeated Wis\u0142a 4\u20132. The number of matches without a loss was then settled at 73, overcoming the former Polish record of 48 which belonged to Legia Warsaw. During the 2008\u201309 season, Wis\u0142a lost points at home only twice, drawing with \u0141KS \u0141\u00f3d\u017a and being defeated by Lech Pozna\u0144.\n\n\n== Supporters and rivalries ==\n\n\n=== Fan Friendlies ===\nWis\u0142a fans formerly had relations with Lechia Gda\u0144sk and \u015al\u0105sk Wroc\u0142aw until 2016, when their alliance fell apart. They formed a new group with Ruch Chorz\u00f3w and Widzew \u0141\u00f3d\u017a which divided Wis\u0142a fans. The club also has relations with Italian side Lazio, Serbian Red Star, and formerly held relations with Unia Tarn\u00f3w.\n\n\n=== The Holy War ===\nThe term \"Holy War\" refers to the intense rivalry between the two Krak\u00f3w-based teams; Wis\u0142a and KS Cracovia. In 1906, the establishment of the two first Polish football clubs, Cracovia and Wis\u0142a, created a rivalry that now dates back more than 100 years. The term \"Holy War\" was first used to describe the rivalry of Krak\u00f3w's Jewish teams, Makkabi and Jutrzenka. A Jutrzenka defender, Ludwik Gintel, who later joined the Cracovia side referred to the derby match against Wis\u0142a as the \"Holy War\". The phrase was incorporated into a song and has since been popular amongst both Wis\u0142a and Cracovia fans.\nThe first recorded Krak\u00f3w Derby was contested on 20 September 1908, a 1\u20131 draw.

It ranks fourth in the number of national titles won (13), behind G\u00f3rnik Zabrze, Ruch Chorz\u00f3w (both on 14), and Legia Warsaw (15), and second in all-time victories. Wis\u0142a was founded in 1906 under the name TS Wis\u0142a (Polish: Towarzystwo Sportowe Wis\u0142a).\nThe club's coat of arms is a white star on a red background crossed by a blue ribbon.\nWis\u0142a Krak\u00f3w has been one of the most successful Polish football clubs in recent years, winning eight league championships since 1999. Along with league titles, Wis\u0142a also won the Polish Cup on four occasions. Wis\u0142a also enjoyed some success in European competitions in the 1970s, reaching the quarter-finals in the 1978\u201379 European Cup and winning the UEFA Intertoto Cup in 1969, 1970 and 1973.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nWis\u0142a Krak\u00f3w was founded in 1906 when students of the Second Practical School in Krak\u00f3w, inspired by their professor Tadeusz \u0141opusza\u0144ski, formed a football club.In this first, historic season of the League, the fight for the championship was decided between two teams: Wis\u0142a Krak\u00f3w and 1. FC Kattowitz. This rivalry was treated very seriously, not only by the two sides involved, but also by the whole nation. 1. FC was regarded as the team supported by the German minority, while Wis\u0142a, at the end of this historic season, represented ambitions of all Poles.\n\nSome time in the fall of 1927 in Katowice, an ill-fated game between 1.FC and Wis\u0142a took place. Stakes were very high \u2013 the winner would become the Champion. Krak\u00f3w's side won 2\u20130 and became the Champion. 1.FC finished second, third was Warta Pozna\u0144.\nIn 1949, the club was renamed to Gwardia-Wis\u0142a Krak\u00f3w. In 1955 the club returned to its original name, TS Wis\u0142a. In 1967, the club was once again renamed, to GTS Wis\u0142a, a name which held until 1990 when the club reverted to its original name, TS Wis\u0142a. In the late 1990s, the football section of the club was incorporated and was renamed Wis\u0142a Krak\u00f3w SSA.\nThe club has had its ups and downs, winning national championships and earning European qualification. It was also relegated to the second division on three occasions. Since the football section has been bought by Tele-Fonika Kable S.A. in 1998, the team has been far and away the most successful club in Poland, winning seven national championships and finishing in second place three times, totalling ten top two finishes in 12 years.\nAt international level, Wis\u0142a has competed in all three of the European competitions. The club's greatest success came in the 1978\u201379 season, when Wis\u0142a was able to reach the quarter-finals of the European Cup, eventually to be knocked out by Malm\u00f6 FF 3\u20135 on aggregate. Most recently, Wis\u0142a narrowly missed out on a chance to compete in the 2005\u201306 UEFA Champions League group stage, being defeated 4\u20135 by Panathinaikos after extra time.Wis\u0142a also twice reached the second round of the European Cup Winners' Cup in 1967\u201368 and 1984\u201385, falling 0\u20135 and 2\u20133 by Hamburger SV and Fortuna Sittard respectively.\nThe White Star has competed in the UEFA Cup ten times.\n\n\n== Stadium ==\n\nWis\u0142a's Stadium is located at 22 Reymonta Street in Krak\u00f3w. The stadium was originally built in 1953 and currently has a capacity of 33,326.  The stadium was renovated in 2010, being upgraded to UEFA elite standards. The Wis\u0142a Stadium was also chosen as a reserve venue for the UEFA Euro 2012 tournament, jointly held in Poland and Ukraine. The record attendance of 45,000 at Wis\u0142a Stadium came on 29 September 1976 when Wis\u0142a defeated Celtic 2\u20130. The venue has been a fortress for Wis\u0142a, where the team is especially difficult to defeat. It is worth noting that Wis\u0142a holds the all-time Polish football record for consecutive league home games without a loss. The streak began following a loss on 16 September 2001 to KSZO Ostrowiec \u015awi\u0119tokrzyski, and ended more than five years later on 11 November 2006, when GKS Be\u0142chat\u00f3w defeated Wis\u0142a 4\u20132. The number of matches without a loss was then settled at 73, overcoming the former Polish record of 48 which belonged to Legia Warsaw. During the 2008\u201309 season, Wis\u0142a lost points at home only twice, drawing with \u0141KS \u0141\u00f3d\u017a and being defeated by Lech Pozna\u0144.\n\n\n== Supporters and rivalries ==\n\n\n=== Fan Friendlies ===\nWis\u0142a fans formerly had relations with Lechia Gda\u0144sk and \u015al\u0105sk Wroc\u0142aw until 2016, when their alliance fell apart. They formed a new group with Ruch Chorz\u00f3w and Widzew \u0141\u00f3d\u017a which divided Wis\u0142a fans. The club also has relations with Italian side Lazio, Serbian Red Star, and formerly held relations with Unia Tarn\u00f3w.\n\n\n=== The Holy War ===\nThe term \"Holy War\" refers to the intense rivalry between the two Krak\u00f3w-based teams; Wis\u0142a and KS Cracovia. In 1906, the establishment of the two first Polish football clubs, Cracovia and Wis\u0142a, created a rivalry that now dates back more than 100 years. The term \"Holy War\" was first used to describe the rivalry of Krak\u00f3w's Jewish teams, Makkabi and Jutrzenka. A Jutrzenka defender, Ludwik Gintel, who later joined the Cracovia side referred to the derby match against Wis\u0142a as the \"Holy War\". The phrase was incorporated into a song and has since been popular amongst both Wis\u0142a and Cracovia fans.\nThe first recorded Krak\u00f3w Derby was contested on 20 September 1908, a 1\u20131 draw. A historic derby match between Cracovia and Wis\u0142a occurred on 8 May 1913. It was the first time Polish teams played a championship game officially sanctioned by FIFA; Cracovia won 2\u20131. The most famous derby took place in 1948 when after the first post-war season, both Cracovia and Wis\u0142a accumulated an even number of points and the championship had to be decided by an additional game played at a neutral venue. On 5 December 1948, Cracovia defeated Wis\u0142a 3\u20131 and was crowned national champions. As of May 2011, the Krak\u00f3w derby game between Wis\u0142a and Cracovia has been contested 183 times, with Wis\u0142a winning 82 times, tying 42 times and Cracovia winning 59 times.\n\n\n=== Poland's Derby ===\nThe match contested between Wis\u0142a Krak\u00f3w and Legia Warsaw is commonly recognized as the greatest rivalry in Polish club football. Historically the two sides have been the most successful clubs in Poland, both in the top 2 in the all-time table. The rivalry between two of Poland's premier cities of Krak\u00f3w and Warsaw sparks the rivalry even more.

He is an Olympic silver medalist in the team competition at the 2004 Olympics and a two-time Olympian (2000, 2004). He also was a member of the silver-medal winning team at the 2003 World Championships. Hamm was named to the 2008 Olympic team, but withdrew from it due to injury.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nHamm is the son of Sandy and Cecily Hamm. His twin brother, Paul Hamm, is also a gymnast and is the 2004 Olympic All-Around Champion. His older sister, Elizabeth (Betsy), is a former member of USA Gymnastics Senior National Team. She competed for the University of Florida, where she became the NCAA\u2019s national balance beam champion in 1998 and was a seven-time All-American. His father was an All-American springboard diver.\nIn 2010, Hamm enrolled at Concordia University Wisconsin to study pharmacology. In 2014, he successfully completed his studies and earned his Doctor of Pharmacy degree. He is currently a practicing Pharm.D.\n\n\n== Career ==\nHamm competed at the 2000 Olympics in Sydney at age 17, and the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, alongside his twin brother Paul. At the 2004 Olympics, he won the silver medal with the U.S. team in the team competition. Morgan's contribution to this medal-winning performance was vital as he performed on four of the six apparatus and was the highest scorer for the team on vault and high bar. He also competed in floor and high bar finals, and only a tie-breaker kept him from winning the bronze medal on the latter event. Morgan was also a member of the U.S. team at the 2003 World Championships that won a silver medal in the team competition.\nIn February 2007, Hamm announced that he would return to competitive gymnastics. He competed at the 2007 Visa National Championships, on floor and pommel horse. He competed at the 2008 National Championships and at the 2008 Olympic Trials. He was warned by the United States Anti-Doping Agency in July for testing positive for glucocorticosteroid, which is not performance-enhancing or banned but only allowed if proper paperwork is filed to document that the drug is used for therapeutic reasons. Hamm received the substance through an anti-inflammatory shot to his injured ankle but failed to file the paperwork and his results at the May 24 National Championships were thrown out. Hamm claimed that he had a legitimate medical need for the drug. He was ultimately selected for the 2008 Olympic team.  However, Hamm withdrew from the Olympics on August 7, 2008, due to an ankle injury. Alexander Artemev replaced him on the team.\n\n\n== Sasuke ==\nMorgan Hamm also competed alongside his brother, Paul Hamm, in the two 2005 Sasuke competitions (#14, #15,).

It has, in addition to the main campus in Campo Grande (the State's capital), nine campuses located in the following inland cities: Aquidauana, Chapad\u00e3o do Sul, Corumb\u00e1, Coxim, Navira\u00ed, Nova Andradina, Parana\u00edba, Ponta Por\u00e3 e Tr\u00eas Lagoas.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Federal University of Mato Grosso do Sul's history begins in 1962, with the establishment of the University of Pharmacy and Odontology, being located in Campo Grande, which then belonged to the state of Mato Grosso.\nFurthermore, during the 1960s, the Brazilian dictatorship had plans to fund federal universities in each state capital. However, the southern population of Mato Grosso would not have access to them, which helped to increase the strength of the separatist movement and made the former state governor, Pedro Pedrossian, start to plan the creation of the State University of Mato Grosso, in Campo Grande.\nMeanwhile, in 1966, the University of Pharmacy and Odontology became Campo Grande's Biological Sciences Institute, which added a Medicine course to its curriculum. In 1967, the state of Mato Grosso's administration established the Human Sciences and Modern Languages Institute in Tr\u00eas Lagoas and the Superior Institute of Pedagogy, in Corumb\u00e1.In 1969, the State University of Mato Grosso was finally created. This new institution incorporated all of the above, and extended its reach, in 1970, to the towns of Aquidauana and Dourados, with the creation of two Centers of Pedagogy. The State University of Mato Grosso's creation was officialized on the 4th of November, 1970.\nIn 1977, the state of Mato Grosso was divided in two by the former president Ernesto Geisel. Therefore, the State University of Mato Grosso was now mainly located in cities that belonged to Mato Grosso do Sul. To solve this problem, the federal government established the Federal University of Mato Grosso do Sul, with its main campus being in Campo Grande, the new state's capital.\nThus, the Federal University of Mato Grosso do Sul, as it is today, was officially created in 1979, by the law number 6.674, enacted by former president Jo\u00e3o Figueiredo.\n\n\n== Campuses ==\nThe university has nine campuses, located in the cities of Campo Grande, Aquidauana, Corumb\u00e1, Coxim, Navira\u00ed, Nova Andradina, Parana\u00edba, Ponta Por\u00e3 and Tr\u00eas Lagoas.The campus located at the city of Campo Grande, capital of the state of Mato Grosso do Sul, is the main administrative headquarters of the University. It also counts with its own University Hospital and two sports stadiums.\nThe campus located at the city of Dourados was separated from the Federal University of Mato Grosso do Sul in 2006, giving birth to its own University: the Federal University of Grande Dourados, by the Law number 11.153In 2015, a campus in the city of Bonito was opened, however being closed a few years later, in 2019. Even so, the building of the campus kept acting as a Advanced Research Unit.\n\n\n== Graduation Courses ==\n\n\n=== Campo Grande campus ===\nBiological Sciences\nBiology\nNursing\nPharmacy\nPhysiotherapy\nExact Sciences\nArchitecture\nEnvironmental Engineering\nCivil Engineering\nElectrical Engineering\nPhysics\nMathematics\nChemistry\nHuman Sciences\nManagement\nVisual Arts\nEconomics\nSocial Sciences\nSocial Communication\nPhysical Education\nPhilosophy\nHistory\nLinguistics\nMusic\nPedagogy\nPsychology\nSchool of Computing\nComputer Science\nComputer Engineering\nSoftware Engineering\nSystems Analysis\nSystems Development and Analysis\nComputer Networks\nLaw School\nLaw\nMedical School\nMedicine\nVeterinary School\nVeterinary Medicine\nDentistry School\nDentistry\n\n\n=== Aquidauana campus ===\nBiological Sciences\nBiology\nExact Sciences\nMathematics\nHuman Sciences\nManagement\nGeography\nHistory\nLinguistics\nPedagogy\nTourism\n\n\n== Maria Aparecida Pedrossian University Hospital ==\nThe Maria Aparecida Pedrossian University Hospital was opened in 1971 as a way to support the Medical School of the former State University of Mato Grosso, but needed to be closed right afterwards due to lack of resources, being reopened only in 1975.\nThe hospital has multiple facilities, including its own surgery center, intensive therapy center for adults and children, neonatal intensive care unit, obstetrics center, human milk bank, among others. Also, hemodialisys and radiology services are also performed at the facility.\nProcedures are completely free of charge, as the hospital is a part of the Brazilian unified public healthcare system. Currently, it counts with medical residency in 20 specialties, being reference in high risk motherhood, attending bearers of HIV and treating contagious diseases.\n\n\n== Criticism ==\nThe university has been criticized for owning Moren\u00e3o, a soccer stadium used by professional teams. Critics say that the purchase of the stadium was a wrong use of governmental funds. However, part of Moren\u00e3o is used for academic research.\n\n\n== Notable alumni ==\nSeveral notable students have been through some form of education by the Federal University of Mato Grosso do Sul. Among them, it is worth mentioning Luiz Henrique Mandetta, former Health Minister for the Jair Bolsonaro government, who specialized in orthopedics by the Federal University. Also, names such as Wellington Fagundes, senator for the state of Mato Grosso; Luiz Alberto Ovando, congressman for the state of Mato Grosso do Sul; and Neiva Guedes, president of the Instituto Arara-Azul and its Hyacinth Macaw Project; have been through this University.\n\n\n== References ==\nhttp://www2.ebserh.gov.br/web/humap-ufms.\nhttps://www.ufms.br/universidade/historico/.\nBrasil, lei n\u00b0 6.674. 5 de jul de 1979.\nBrasil, lei complementar n\u00b0 31. 11 de out de 1977.\nSouza, D\u00e9bora Nepomuceno de; Bittar, Mariluce (2013-05-27). \"Pol\u00edtica de educa\u00e7\u00e3o superior e os programas de perman\u00eancia para universidades p\u00fablicas - 2003-2010\".

In 1967, the state of Mato Grosso's administration established the Human Sciences and Modern Languages Institute in Tr\u00eas Lagoas and the Superior Institute of Pedagogy, in Corumb\u00e1.In 1969, the State University of Mato Grosso was finally created. This new institution incorporated all of the above, and extended its reach, in 1970, to the towns of Aquidauana and Dourados, with the creation of two Centers of Pedagogy. The State University of Mato Grosso's creation was officialized on the 4th of November, 1970.\nIn 1977, the state of Mato Grosso was divided in two by the former president Ernesto Geisel. Therefore, the State University of Mato Grosso was now mainly located in cities that belonged to Mato Grosso do Sul. To solve this problem, the federal government established the Federal University of Mato Grosso do Sul, with its main campus being in Campo Grande, the new state's capital.\nThus, the Federal University of Mato Grosso do Sul, as it is today, was officially created in 1979, by the law number 6.674, enacted by former president Jo\u00e3o Figueiredo.\n\n\n== Campuses ==\nThe university has nine campuses, located in the cities of Campo Grande, Aquidauana, Corumb\u00e1, Coxim, Navira\u00ed, Nova Andradina, Parana\u00edba, Ponta Por\u00e3 and Tr\u00eas Lagoas.The campus located at the city of Campo Grande, capital of the state of Mato Grosso do Sul, is the main administrative headquarters of the University. It also counts with its own University Hospital and two sports stadiums.\nThe campus located at the city of Dourados was separated from the Federal University of Mato Grosso do Sul in 2006, giving birth to its own University: the Federal University of Grande Dourados, by the Law number 11.153In 2015, a campus in the city of Bonito was opened, however being closed a few years later, in 2019. Even so, the building of the campus kept acting as a Advanced Research Unit.\n\n\n== Graduation Courses ==\n\n\n=== Campo Grande campus ===\nBiological Sciences\nBiology\nNursing\nPharmacy\nPhysiotherapy\nExact Sciences\nArchitecture\nEnvironmental Engineering\nCivil Engineering\nElectrical Engineering\nPhysics\nMathematics\nChemistry\nHuman Sciences\nManagement\nVisual Arts\nEconomics\nSocial Sciences\nSocial Communication\nPhysical Education\nPhilosophy\nHistory\nLinguistics\nMusic\nPedagogy\nPsychology\nSchool of Computing\nComputer Science\nComputer Engineering\nSoftware Engineering\nSystems Analysis\nSystems Development and Analysis\nComputer Networks\nLaw School\nLaw\nMedical School\nMedicine\nVeterinary School\nVeterinary Medicine\nDentistry School\nDentistry\n\n\n=== Aquidauana campus ===\nBiological Sciences\nBiology\nExact Sciences\nMathematics\nHuman Sciences\nManagement\nGeography\nHistory\nLinguistics\nPedagogy\nTourism\n\n\n== Maria Aparecida Pedrossian University Hospital ==\nThe Maria Aparecida Pedrossian University Hospital was opened in 1971 as a way to support the Medical School of the former State University of Mato Grosso, but needed to be closed right afterwards due to lack of resources, being reopened only in 1975.\nThe hospital has multiple facilities, including its own surgery center, intensive therapy center for adults and children, neonatal intensive care unit, obstetrics center, human milk bank, among others. Also, hemodialisys and radiology services are also performed at the facility.\nProcedures are completely free of charge, as the hospital is a part of the Brazilian unified public healthcare system.

Globis University started as a private education venture, Globis Management School, in 1992 by Japanese entrepreneur Yoshito Hori, later gaining official university status in 2006. Globis University is Japan's largest graduate business school, with an annual intake of 1,050 MBA students and enrollment of 2,624 students in 2021. \nThe university offers part-time and online MBA degree programs in English or Japanese and a full-time degree MBA program in English.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== GLOBIS Management School ===\nGlobis Management School was established as a private, non-accredited business school in Tokyo by Globis Corporation and its founder Yoshito Hori in 1992. It would form the basis for the later establishment of Graduate School of Management, Globis University. Hori, while doing his MBA at Harvard Business School from 1989 until 1991, observed that entrepreneurs in the US had access to a business environment highly conducive to start-ups. Aiming to nurture a similar environment in Japan, he set out to create a business centered around an ecosystem of knowledge, people and capital.Hori had initially approached his alma mater regarding opening a franchise in Japan but was turned down, leading to the establishment of an independent business school. A licensing agreement was made, however, allowing Harvard case studies to be used at GLOBIS Management School. The school started with 800,000 yen (about $7,000 USD) in capital and a single marketing course taught at a small rented classroom in Shibuya. Additional business subjects such as finance were soon introduced, all structured around the case study method, which was quite novel in Japan at the time.In 1993 a campus in Osaka was opened. By 1996 the curriculum had been expanded to allow the establishment of a joint MBA program with the University of Leicester. The first part of the program consisted of classes taught by Globis Management School in Japanese at locations in Tokyo and Osaka or by correspondence. The second part of the program was provided in English by Leicester Business School by correspondence. The joint MBA program would continue until January 2008.In 2003 the Graduate Diploma in Business Administration (GDBA) was launched, a non-degree program and predecessor to the MBA degree offered after university status was attained. GDBA was discontinued in 2013 with a total of 220 students having graduated.\n\n\n=== University Status ===\n\nGlobis Management School was accredited in December 2005 as a for-profit university established by a private company (\u682a\u5f0f\u4f1a\u793e\u7acb\u5927\u5b66, kabushiki gaisha ritsu daigaku). Provisions for the establishment of this type of university had been introduced as part of the Special Zones for Structural Reform Program (\u69cb\u9020\u6539\u9769\u7279\u5225\u533a\u57df\u5236\u5ea6, k\u014dz\u014d kaikaku tokubetsu kuiki seido) previously in 2003. This led to the establishment of the Graduate School of Management, Globis University in April 2006. That same year, university campuses in Tokyo and Osaka were formally established.However, in 2008 the decision was made to change the incorporation entity of Graduate School of Management, Globis University to a non-profit incorporated educational institution (\u5b66\u6821\u6cd5\u4eba, gakk\u014d h\u014djin) private university (\u79c1\u7acb\u5927\u5b66, shiritsu daigaku). This entity type had traditionally been reserved for organizations with substantial funds and ownership of land for campus development, but became an option for universities established by private companies after MEXT introduced changes to requirements. Changing to an incorporated educational institution allowed Globis University to establish a fund supported by internal reserves and donations, enabling a more stable and long-term development of the educational environment and campus facilities.\n\n\n=== Expansion ===\nFurther university campus locations were added in Nagoya in 2009, Sendai in 2012, Fukuoka in 2013, and Yokohama and Mito, Ibaraki in 2017. Outside of Japan campus locations were opened in Singapore in 2019 and Bangkok in 2020.\n\n\n== Campuses ==\n\nGlobis University has five campuses in Tokyo, Osaka, Nagoya, Sendai, and Fukuoka and two satellite campuses (\u7279\u8a2d\u30ad\u30e3\u30f3\u30d1\u30b9, tokusetsu kyanpasu) in Yokohama and Mito, Ibaraki in Japan. The main campus is located near K\u014djimachi Station in Banch\u014d, Chiyoda in central Tokyo, which offers both Japanese and English-language MBA programs. The Osaka, Nagoya, Sendai, and Fukuoka campuses offer Japanese-language MBA programs.

Globis University started as a private education venture, Globis Management School, in 1992 by Japanese entrepreneur Yoshito Hori, later gaining official university status in 2006. Globis University is Japan's largest graduate business school, with an annual intake of 1,050 MBA students and enrollment of 2,624 students in 2021. \nThe university offers part-time and online MBA degree programs in English or Japanese and a full-time degree MBA program in English.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== GLOBIS Management School ===\nGlobis Management School was established as a private, non-accredited business school in Tokyo by Globis Corporation and its founder Yoshito Hori in 1992. It would form the basis for the later establishment of Graduate School of Management, Globis University. Hori, while doing his MBA at Harvard Business School from 1989 until 1991, observed that entrepreneurs in the US had access to a business environment highly conducive to start-ups. Aiming to nurture a similar environment in Japan, he set out to create a business centered around an ecosystem of knowledge, people and capital.Hori had initially approached his alma mater regarding opening a franchise in Japan but was turned down, leading to the establishment of an independent business school. A licensing agreement was made, however, allowing Harvard case studies to be used at GLOBIS Management School. The school started with 800,000 yen (about $7,000 USD) in capital and a single marketing course taught at a small rented classroom in Shibuya. Additional business subjects such as finance were soon introduced, all structured around the case study method, which was quite novel in Japan at the time.In 1993 a campus in Osaka was opened. By 1996 the curriculum had been expanded to allow the establishment of a joint MBA program with the University of Leicester. The first part of the program consisted of classes taught by Globis Management School in Japanese at locations in Tokyo and Osaka or by correspondence. The second part of the program was provided in English by Leicester Business School by correspondence. The joint MBA program would continue until January 2008.In 2003 the Graduate Diploma in Business Administration (GDBA) was launched, a non-degree program and predecessor to the MBA degree offered after university status was attained. GDBA was discontinued in 2013 with a total of 220 students having graduated.\n\n\n=== University Status ===\n\nGlobis Management School was accredited in December 2005 as a for-profit university established by a private company (\u682a\u5f0f\u4f1a\u793e\u7acb\u5927\u5b66, kabushiki gaisha ritsu daigaku). Provisions for the establishment of this type of university had been introduced as part of the Special Zones for Structural Reform Program (\u69cb\u9020\u6539\u9769\u7279\u5225\u533a\u57df\u5236\u5ea6, k\u014dz\u014d kaikaku tokubetsu kuiki seido) previously in 2003. This led to the establishment of the Graduate School of Management, Globis University in April 2006. That same year, university campuses in Tokyo and Osaka were formally established.However, in 2008 the decision was made to change the incorporation entity of Graduate School of Management, Globis University to a non-profit incorporated educational institution (\u5b66\u6821\u6cd5\u4eba, gakk\u014d h\u014djin) private university (\u79c1\u7acb\u5927\u5b66, shiritsu daigaku). This entity type had traditionally been reserved for organizations with substantial funds and ownership of land for campus development, but became an option for universities established by private companies after MEXT introduced changes to requirements. Changing to an incorporated educational institution allowed Globis University to establish a fund supported by internal reserves and donations, enabling a more stable and long-term development of the educational environment and campus facilities.\n\n\n=== Expansion ===\nFurther university campus locations were added in Nagoya in 2009, Sendai in 2012, Fukuoka in 2013, and Yokohama and Mito, Ibaraki in 2017. Outside of Japan campus locations were opened in Singapore in 2019 and Bangkok in 2020.\n\n\n== Campuses ==\n\nGlobis University has five campuses in Tokyo, Osaka, Nagoya, Sendai, and Fukuoka and two satellite campuses (\u7279\u8a2d\u30ad\u30e3\u30f3\u30d1\u30b9, tokusetsu kyanpasu) in Yokohama and Mito, Ibaraki in Japan. The main campus is located near K\u014djimachi Station in Banch\u014d, Chiyoda in central Tokyo, which offers both Japanese and English-language MBA programs. The Osaka, Nagoya, Sendai, and Fukuoka campuses offer Japanese-language MBA programs. Satellite campuses in Yokohama and Mito, Ibaraki only offer non-degree Pre-MBA courses in Japanese.\nOutside of Japan Globis University offers non-degree English-language Pre-MBA courses at campus locations in Singapore and Bangkok.\n\n\n== Academics ==\n\n\n=== Academic Programs ===\nGlobis University consists of a single graduate school of management. The university offers a one-year Full-time MBA degree program in English, which includes a 3-month professional internship, and two-year Part-time MBA and Online MBA degree programs in either Japanese or English.

The work depicts, from left to right, Brian Jones, Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin, Jim Morrison, Jean-Michel Basquiat, Kurt Cobain, Amy Winehouse and an unknown figure, \"believed to be the artist.\"\n\n\n== Background ==\nThe artwork is 3 m (9.8 ft) high by 7 m (23 ft) wide, and depicts seven artists from the \"27 Club\", a list of popular musicians or artists who died at the age of 27.\nThe work was created by John Kiss, an Israeli street artist and peace activist. Known previously as Jonathan Kis-Lev, His graffiti work, political installations, community-based projects and public artworks have granted him the title the \u201cIsraeli Banksy.\u201d\n\n\n== Development ==\nKiss enjoyed creating large murals corresponding with the art of graffiti, and drawing references to tales and legends. However, he also wished to discuss deeper messages in his work, and to lead viewers to existential contemplation and even cathartic experiences. One such existential contemplation which highly engrossed Kiss in his twenties came as a result of his commercial success as an artist. Beginning to sell his art in galleries around the world, he was often uncomfortable with his success, the perception of his success, and the \"price of fame.\" The more well known Kiss had become in the art world, the more he found the attention addictive: \"It was easy to indulge in the attention, in the admiration and the external validation. Yet it left me altogether more lonely,\" and was followed by \"emptiness.\"Kiss became obsessed with what he called \"the price of fame,\" being the success of people won public acclaim at an early age. He was intrigued by artists who died early after achieving great fame, and, in particular, he was drawn to the life of Jean-Michel Basquiat. Basquiat, a contemporary of Andy Warhol, was famous by age twenty, selling his street-art paintings in auctions for great sums. Basquiat's success came, however, at a price. He died at age 27 of a heroin overdose.Kiss became obsessed with Basquiat beginning in his early twenties. Since Basquiat was a graffiti artist, and since Kiss as well was a graffiti artist, and since both of them won relative success in their early twenties, Kiss felt that Basquiat's death at age 27 was an ominous, foreboding warning.\nKiss was 26 years old when English singer Amy Winehouse died. She, like Basquiat, also died at the age of 27. The approaching 27th birthday for Kiss the following year felt \"seriously threatening\" for the artist.\nVeering away from the whimsicality of some of his previous work, Kiss began researching other well-known artists who died at that age, and to find the causes for their death, hoping to somehow learn how to save himself from that fate. The list was exhaustingly long, comprising the infamous \"27 Club\". Kiss began sketching portraits of artists who died at that age: Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin, Jim Morrison, Kurt Cobain, Amy Winehouse, and Jean-Michel Basquiat, among others. The theme soon began occupying Kiss' time to an extent verging on obsession.\nConstantly preoccupied with the 27 Club, Kiss decided to paint a large scale mural showing portraits of key figures who died at 27. Remarkably, he also decided to include a portrait of himself in the mural, with the intention of erasing his own portrait when\u2014and if\u2014he would turn 28. \"Erasing myself was to be my victory of survival,\" he explained.\nKiss planned the mural for months as he wished to execute it \"perfectly.\" He painted sketches repeatedly, never truly becoming ready to paint the mural. He later said, \"I think it was a delay mechanism, a way to protect myself. I was not ready.\" It was only after Kiss turned 28 that he set to finally create the mural.\n\nWhile the subject matter of the mural could be depressing\u2014the early death of highly talented individuals\u2014Kiss wished to portray an \"uplifting\" portrait of theses individuals and their lives. \"I wanted to do something that would celebrate their creative life rather than lament their early death. For that I needed colors.\" Kiss decided to give each character three unique colors: first a light background, then a darker color for the shades, and finally a dark color for the eyes, nostrils and tiny facial features. Each figure was to have its own set of colors, and the colors for all the figures had to \"harmonize together to a complete piece.\" As to the figures' expression, Kiss wished to depict each figure directly facing the viewer, staring into the viewer with a blank, powerful stare.Kiss chose a prominent wall in the heart of Tel Aviv, on Haim Ben Atar Street. Unlike previous pieces Kiss created, he knew this piece, due to its size and intricate usage of colors and layers, could not be completed quickly, and that the police was bound to come and arrest him. Apart from heavy fines, the penalty in Israel for anyone who paints, writes, engraves or draws on private walls is up to a one-year prison sentence.To avoid getting arrested Kiss created an elaborate cover story to explain to police officers that the work was \"commissioned\" by the Tel Aviv city hall's public art department. Kiss chose the holiday of Rosh Hashana, when city hall workers were in their annual vacation, as the time to execute the work and ensure that the police would be unable to reach the public art department in the city hall. To convince police that the large work was indeed commissioned, he made himself and the team wear yellow vests and yellow helmets like city hall workers. He also rented a private crane and prepared special signs to be pasted on the crane stating: \"Property of the Tel Aviv Municipality.\"Art journalist Zipa Kampinski of Israel's largest newspaper, Yedioth Ahronoth, was privy to the story and covered the mural's secretive creation process.Kiss was assisted by fellow artists Itai Froumin and Roman Kozhokin to execute the piece. The police came immediately after work began on the large wall. Kiss argued convincingly, and the work was not stopped nor was the team arrested although the police arrived several times to the scene. The work took 24 hours for the team to complete. The large painting attracted an enthusiastic audience to the spot where the graffiti was created which confused the police officers.\nLike in previous works, Kiss included his signature drips at the bottom of the mural. He painted the portraits of the famous artists in colors, but left his own portrait at the far right in gray.The result, 3 m (9.8 ft) high by 7 m (23 ft) wide, depicted seven artists from the \"27 Club\". The work depicts, from left to right: Brian Jones, Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin, Jim Morrison, Jean-Michel Basquiat, Kurt Cobain, Amy Winehouse and the figure of the artist. Soon after the completion of the work, Kiss' portrait was vandalized with pink paint thrown at it. Kiss did not supply the press with details about his own figure, which was left for many to guess, believing the figure \"to be the artist\".\n\n\n== Reception ==\nIn an article in The Mediterranean Observer, it was stated that:Located at Haim Ben-Atar Street in Tel Aviv, local artist John Kiss shows the most popular members from the fictitious \u201c27 Club.\u201d The piece depicts Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin, Jim Morrison, Brian Jones, Jean-Michel Basquiat, Kurt Cobain, Amy Winehouse; all of whom died tragically at the age of 27. To the far right, there is an 8th unknown man believed to be the artist himself. As the story goes at the time, Kiss was dealing with drug and alcohol addiction, including himself in this piece was seen as some sort of self-fulfilling prophecy in his own eyes. One day, someone painted over his face, causing many to speculate on the art work\u2019s new meaning. Some say that the artists\u2019 enemies covered his face in an act of pettiness; others noted that either the artist or his sister came to cover his face after he successfully lived to 28, beating his own prophecy.Kiss' portrait was covered by pink paint, and \"there is some argument as to whether or not the pink paint over Kiss\u2019s face was done by Kiss himself or another artist. One rumor is that Kiss was so disappointed in all that he hadn\u2019t accomplished by the age of 27, that he included paint to cover his face.\" Another was that he was proud he had made it to age 28, which was why he included his face, and then erased it himself.The artist received \"much criticism\" for including his own portrait among the 27 club members. The criticism focused on adding his portrait alongside great artists who have not crossed the age of 27. According to this view, if indeed it was not Kiss himself who mysteriously covered his face, the covering of his face by an anonymous vandal was therefor \"just.\" Some interpret the work as depressing, and see a morbid quality to it. Others note the \"pain which follows the disappearance of the sudden gratification of fame and the dangerous emptiness that follows.\"Over the years since its creation in 2014 the work has become known as one of Israel's must-see street artworks, and according to From the Grapevine Magazine \"the most popular in Florentin.\" Some locals define it as \"sensational,\" and as their superior version of a local \"museum,\" demanding the municipality to \"preserve it.\"The work was featured in the Israeli street art documentary The Streets Are Ours (\"HaRehovot Hem Shelanu\"). It also appeared in books, magazines, newspapers, online journals, and praised as being an incident in which the \"greatest art is actually on the street,\" and in which \"graffiti manages to be graffiti, in the good sense of the word.\"Outside of Israel, the work became a symbol of the 27 club. It was featured in universities, news sites,  travel magazines, as well as was being parodied often. It appeared in articles in Polish, Italian, Spanish, French, Indonesian, Russian, and others.\nPrints of it appeared in international museum exhibits. It is considered one of the top graffiti works in Israel.As of April 2021, the work is still visible and remains intact. The spot where it was painted had become a meeting point for tours to convene in, and the wall right underneath it is today filled with dozens of graffiti works by multiple artists from around the world. It became a symbol of the gentrification process in South Tel Aviv, as well as an icon of the city. Time Out Magazine cited this work among \"The most beautiful in Tel Aviv.\"\n\n\n== See also ==\nBanksy\nStreet art\nList of street artists\n\n\n== External links ==\n\"6 Incredible Street Art Pieces in Tel Aviv, Israel\".

Painted in 1990, it has become one of the best known pieces of Berlin wall graffiti art. The painting depicts Leonid Brezhnev and Erich Honecker in a socialist fraternal kiss, reproducing a photograph taken in 1979 during the 30th anniversary celebration of the foundation of the German Democratic Republic.\n\n\n== The photograph ==\nThe well-known photograph capturing the famed embrace was taken by R\u00e9gis Bossu in East Berlin on October 7, 1979. It was widely republished. Brezhnev was visiting East Germany at the time to celebrate the anniversary of its founding as a Communist nation. On October 5, East Germany and the Soviet Union had signed a ten-year agreement of mutual support under which East Germany would provide ships, machinery and chemical equipment to the Soviet Union and the Soviet Union would provide fuel and nuclear equipment to East Germany.Currently, the rights for the photo are managed by Corbis Corporation.\n\n\n== The painting ==\nVrubel created the painting in 1990 on the eastern side of the Berlin Wall. Until the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, Berlin Wall graffiti art existed only on the western side. Vrubel attempted to obtain permission to paint on the eastern side, but the East German Ministry of National Defence disclaimed responsibility for the Wall. Instead, he found a \"Scottish girl\" selling \"permits\" to paint on the Wall, and he signed a contract that gave up all of his rights to the painting.Along with other murals in the section, the painting continued in display after the wall was taken down, but vandalism and atmospheric conditions gradually led to its deterioration. In March 2009, the painting, along with others, was erased from the wall to allow the original artists to repaint them with more durable paints. Vrubel was commissioned to repaint the piece, donating the \u20ac3000 fee he was paid to a social art project in Marzahn.In terms of style, there are slight differences between the 1990 and remade 2009 murals, and Vrubel has admitted he committed technical mistakes on the original piece due to inexperience with the method. However, the main message did not change despite the artist's doubts that Berliners would perceive it differently. The main difference between the first and second \"Kiss\" is the use of lines and color, which improved in the 2009 version giving it a more realistic appearance.\nPhotographer Bossu and Vrubel met in 2009 and were photographed together on 16 June with reproductions of their works.\n\n\n== Critical reception of the painting ==\nMy God, Help Me to Survive This Deadly Love has become one of the best known works of graffiti art on the Berlin Wall. According to Anthony Read and David Fisher, the painting is \"particularly striking, with a sharp, satirical edge.\" However, it was also widely criticized on creation as a straightforward reproduction of the photograph that inspired it.In a 2014 interview, the artist explains how both the location and the characters give meaning to the painting: \"In this painting, there's one German and one Russian, and the Berlin Wall is about the same thing but in reverse: here [in the painting], there's total love, while the Berlin Wall separates two worlds \u2014 it was a perfect fit.\" He wanted to create a \"wow\" factor. However, he did not expect the success it had.Prominent derivative works include Make Everything Great Again, a 2016 Lithuanian mural of Russian president Vladimir Putin and United States president Donald Trump in a similar pose, and a 2016 mural in Bristol featuring Donald Trump and pro-Brexit campaigner and British Member of Parliament Boris Johnson in the run-up to the 2016 referendum.\n\n\n== References ==", "infobox": {"image_file": "Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-F088809-0038, Berlin, East Side Gallery.jpg", "painting_alignment": "right", "image_size": "300px", "title": "My God, Help Me to Survive this Deadly Love", "alt": "Soviet premier [[Leonid Brezhnev]] locked in a mouth-to-mouth kiss with [[German Democratic Republic|East German]] leader [[Erich Honecker]] above the legend ''My God, Help Me to Survive This Deadly Love''", "type": "[[Graffiti]]", "artist": "[[Dmitri Vrubel]]", "year": "{{Start date|1990}}", "height_metric": "365", "width_metric": "480", "height_imperial": "143.7", "width_imperial": "189", "city": "[[Berlin]]", "museum": "[[East Side Gallery]]"}, "wikidata": {"Commons category (P373)": "Mein Gott, hilf mir, diese t\u00f6dliche Liebe zu \u00fcberleben", "image (P18)": "M\u00fchlenstrasse, Berlini Fal (East Side Gallery) a Hedwig-Wachenheim-Strasse-val szemben.

Regarded as the first hip hop motion picture, it includes appearances by seminal figures such as Fab Five Freddy, Lee Qui\u00f1ones, Lady Pink, The Rock Steady Crew, The Cold Crush Brothers, Queen Lisa Lee of Zulu Nation, Grandmaster Flash and ZEPHYR.Wild Style was shot in 1981, completed in 1982, and released theatrically in 1983. The film was later released on home video by Rhino Home Video in 1997. In 2007, it was released on DVD for the 25th anniversary. A 30th anniversary collector's edition was released on Blu-ray in 2012.\n\n\n== Background ==\nAn early version of the Wild Style logo appeared in 1981 when Charlie Ahearn hired graffiti writer Dondi to paint the \"window down\" subway car piece that appears in the film. The Dondi piece was the inspiration for the animated title sequence designed by the artist, Zephyr and animated by Joey Ahlbum in 1982. The Wild Style mural was painted by Zephyr, Revolt and Sharp in 1983. Charlie Ahearn and Fab 5 Freddy began working on the film on late 1981. The approach was a hybrid of a narrative musical and documentary, having the real hip hop pioneers play themselves in a loosely scripted story shot entirely in the South Bronx, the Lower East Side and MTA subway yards.\n\n\n== Synopsis ==\nWild Style centers around a Bronx teenager named Raymond (Lee Qui\u00f1ones), who under the pseudonym \"Zoro\" is a celebrated but anonymous graffiti artist. Raymond scorns a group of graffiti artists, known as the Union Crew, who have turned their talents to legitimate, commissioned murals on the walls of playgrounds and business establishments. Their graffiti murals attracted the attention of Virginia (Patti Astor), a journalist, who brings the uptown hip-hop culture to the downtown art world. There are a series of encounters with graffiti artists, rappers and breakers, leading up to a giant rap-break concert in a Lower East Side band shell decorated by Raymond.\n\n\n== Cast ==\nLee Qui\u00f1ones (Lee) as Raymond Zoro\nFrederick Brathwaite (Fab 5 Freddy) as Phade\nSandra Fabara (Lady Pink) as Rose Lady bug\nPatti Astor as Virginia\nAndrew Witten (Zephyr) as Zroc\nCarlos Morales as Raymond's Brother\nAlfredo Valez as Boy with Broom\nNiva Kislac as Art Patron\nBill Rice as TV Producer\n\n\n== Release ==\nWild Style premiered as part of the New Directors/New Films Festival at the 57th Street Playhouse in New York on March 18, 1983. In November 1983, the film opened at the Embassy 46th Street Theatre on Broadway. By early 1984, it was being shown in other major cities.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nFilm critic Vincent Canby wrote for The New York Times that Wild Style \"never discovers a cinematic rhythm that accurately reflects and then celebrates the rare energy and wit of the artists within the film.\" However, he noted that the \"subjects are appealing, especially Mr. Quinones, a graffiti artist in real life, and Frederick Brathwaite as a very cool artistpromotor.\"On Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 89% based on 18 reviews. Phelim O'Neill of The Guardian noted that despite the low production values, \"nothing else comes close to capturing the atmosphere of the early days of hip-hop and spraycan art...\" Reviewing the film for BBC, David Mattin wrote that \"Wild Style is a cult classic - indisputably the most important hip hop movie, ever.\"\n\n\n== Historical value and impact ==\nThe plot of Wild Style is fairly loose and the film is more notable for featuring several prominent figures from early hip hop culture such as Busy Bee Starski, Fab Five Freddy, The Cold Crush Brothers and Grandmaster Flash. Throughout the movie, there are scenes depicting activities common in the early days of hip hop. These include MCing, turntablism, graffiti and b-boying. The film demonstrates the interconnections between music, dance and art in the development of hip hop culture.\nThe film has received a large cult following over the years after its initial release. Highly regarded hip hop albums such as Illmatic by Nas, Midnight Marauders by A Tribe Called Quest, Black Sunday by Cypress Hill, Resurrection by Common, Big Shots by Charizma, Mm..Food by MF Doom, Check Your Head by Beastie Boys, Beat Konducta by Madlib, Jay Stay Paid by J Dilla and Quality Control by Jurassic 5 have used samples from the film. \nIn 2007, the VH1 Hip Hop Honors paid tribute to Wild Style in recognition of its influence upon the culture. The film was also voted as one of the top ten rock and roll films of all time by the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. In 2012, Wild Style was ranked No. 1 on Billboard's list of the Top 10 Best Hip-Hop Movies Ever. The film was exhibited as part of a 1980s art retrospective at the Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago and the Institute of Contemporary Art, Boston in 2012. In 2021, it was shown at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston to celebrate the closing weekend of the exhibition \"Writing the Future: Basquiat and the Hip-Hop Generation.\"\n\n\n== Soundtrack ==\n\nChris Stein of Blondie worked on the soundtrack and score of Wild Style. The original 1983 soundtrack was released by Animal Records. It consisted of 13 tracks recorded by various artists included in the film. A 25th anniversary edition expanded this to 17 tracks, plus a bonus disc of remixes, instrumentals and DJ tools. The album has been described by Allmusic as \"one of the key records of early 1980s hip-hop\".\n\n\n== See also ==\nStyle Wars\nBeat Street\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nWild Style at IMDb\nWild Style\nWild Style: Times Online movie review\nNew York Times Review\nSoundtrack\nThe Hip Hop History of Wild Style", "infobox": {"name": "Wild Style", "image": "Wild Style (film poster).jpg", "director": "[[Charlie Ahearn]]", "writer": "Charlie Ahearn", "starring": "[[Lee Qui\u00f1ones]]<br />[[Sandra Fabara]]<br />[[Patti Astor]]<br />[[Fab 5 Freddy]]<br />[[Cold Crush Brothers]]<br />[[Rock Steady Crew]]<br />[[Grandmaster Flash]]<br />[[Busy Bee Starski|Busy Bee]]<br />[[Grandmixer DXT]]<br />[[Debbie Harry]]", "music": "[[Chris Stein]]", "producer": "Charlie Ahearn", "distributor": "Submarine Entertainment", "released": "March 18, 1983<br><small>(United States)</small>", "runtime": "82 min.", "language": "English", "gross": "$15,122 <small>(United States)</small> {{cn|date|=|May 2021}}", "country": "United States"}, "wikidata": {"IMDb ID (P345)": "tt0084904", "instance of (P31)": "film (Q11424)", "production company (P272)": "Rhino Entertainment Company (Q627091)", "director of photography (P344)": "John Foster (Q56193349)", "cast member (P161)": ["ZEPHYR (Q4024198)", "Fab Five Freddy (Q958532)", "The Cold Crush Brothers (Q7726628)", "Rock Steady Crew (Q2143261)", "Grandmaster Flash (Q506900)", "Busy Bee Starski (Q1080807)"], "narrative location (P840)": "New York City (Q60)", "genre (P136)": ["docudrama (Q622370)", "drama film (Q130232)", "documentary film (Q93204)", "musical film (Q842256)"], "Freebase ID (P646)": "/m/03h0fg", "GND ID (P227)": "7588207-3", "publication date (P577)": ["+1983-01-01T00:00:00Z", "+1983-11-04T00:00:00Z"], "AllMovie title ID (P1562)": "v54584", "country of origin (P495)": "United States of America (Q30)", "original language of film or TV show (P364)": "English (Q1860)", "VIAF ID (P214)": "206875593", "DNF film ID (P1804)": "3761", "director (P57)": "Charlie Ahearn (Q5084427)", "screenwriter (P58)": "Charlie Ahearn (Q5084427)", "producer (P162)": "Charlie Ahearn (Q5084427)", "official website (P856)": "http://www.wildstylethemovie.com/", "Rotten Tomatoes ID (P1258)": "m/wild_style", "title (P1476)": "Wild Style", "composer (P86)": "Fab Five Freddy (Q958532)", "color (P462)": "color (Q22006653)", "KINENOTE film ID (P2508)": "9950", "Allcinema film ID (P2465)": "25941", "Netflix ID (P1874)": "60025171", "duration (P2047)": {"amount": "+82", "unit": "http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q7727", "upperBound": "+82", "lowerBound": "+82"}, "Kinopoisk film ID (P2603)": "40000", "OFDb film ID (P3138)": "17309", "\u010cSFD film ID (P2529)": "245440", "MovieMeter film ID (P1970)": "5765", "TV.com ID (P2638)": "movies/wild-style", "Elonet movie ID (P2346)": "134595", "AlloCin\u00e9 film ID (P1265)": "112294", "elFilm film ID (P3143)": "84676", "FSK film rating (P1981)": "FSK 12 (Q20644796)", "LdiF ID (P3107)": "36291", "Douban film ID (P4529)": "1307765", "MYmovies movie ID (P4780)": "44949", "Moviepilot.de film ID (P5786)": "wild-style", "distributed by (P750)": ["Rhino Entertainment Company (Q627091)", "Netflix (Q907311)"], "Medier\u00e5det rating (P5970)": "Suitable for a general audience (Q56887384)", "Letterboxd film ID (P6127)": "wild-style", "distribution format (P437)": "video on demand (Q723685)", "iTunes movie ID (P6398)": "1466871496", "TMDb movie ID (P4947)": "14243", "Apple TV movie ID (P9586)": "umc.cmc.74wce1a8cgzyfgt765byzuxh", "review score (P444)": ["89%", "7.3/10"]}, "cat": "Written_communication", "url": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_Style"}, {"name": "Entertainment ID Registry Association", "url_name": "31890739", "txt": "The Entertainment Identifier Registry, or EIDR, is a global unique identifier system for a broad array of audio visual objects, including motion pictures, television, and radio programs. The identification system resolves an identifier to a metadata record that is associated with top-level titles, edits, DVDs, encodings, clips, and mash-ups. EIDR also provides identifiers for video service providers, such as broadcast and cable networks.\nAs of June 2020, EIDR contains over 2 million records, including almost 400 thousand movies, and almost one million episodes from over 40,000 TV series.\nEIDR is an implementation of a digital object identifier (DOI).\n\n\n== History ==\nMedia asset identification systems have existed for decades. The common motivation for their creation is to enable the management of media assets through the assignment of a unique id to a set of metadata representing salient characteristics of each asset. Over time such systems tend to proliferate, with each arising to deal with a specific set of issues. As a result, there is considerable variation between systems in terms of which assets are categorized, which metadata is associated with each asset, and the very definition of an asset. To name a few examples, should a \"director's cut\" of a film be distinct from the original theatrical release? How should regional variations (e.g. translation of the title or dialog into foreign languages) be accounted for? Further complications include the procedures (and required credentials) for adding new assets, editing existing assets, and creating derivative assets.\nEIDR was created to address these issues, as well as others encountered in video asset workflows, both in a business-to-business context and the intramural post-production activities of content producers. EIDR has the following characteristics:\n\nA central registry available to all participants\nAbility to easily register new assets\nAn asset ID that is immutable (and in particular with respect to changes in asset ownership or location of the metadata or the asset itself)\nDetection/prevention of duplicates of the same asset being created\nAbility to create a set of video assets derived from an abstract work (e.g. original theatrical release, director's cut, language variants)\nAbility to group video assets by more general relationships (e.g. episodes of a season of a TV series)\nA core set of metadata to differentiate assets, even when closely related\nScalable, immutable, persistentEIDR is intended to supplement, not replace, existing asset identification systems. To the contrary, a key feature is to allow an EIDR record to include references to that asset's ID under other systems. This feature is particularly useful for film and television archives, making it easy for them to cross-reference their holdings with other sources for the work and metadata about it. By design, EIDR does not replicate features of other asset ID systems, e.g. commercial systems that seek to add value through enhanced metadata (e.g. plot summaries, production details). It is also a non-goal to track ownership and rights information, which can, however, be implemented as applications that use the EIDR ID.\n\n\n== Content model ==\nEIDR is built on a collection of records (which are further sub-divided into fields) that are stored in a central registry. These records are referenced externally by DOIs, which are assigned when a record is created, and each identifier is immutable thereafter. The identifier resolution system underlying DOIs is the Handle System and so each native EIDR Content ID is a handle formatted, in increasing specificity, to handle, DOI and EIDR standards.\n\n\n=== Content ID format ===\nThe canonical form of an EIDR Content ID is an instance of a handle and has the format:\n\n10.5240/XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-Cwhere\n\n10.5240 is the DOI prefix for an EIDR asset. The \"10\" indicates the handle is a DOI; other prefixes are assigned to other asset types (e.g. academic publications). The digits between the \".\" and \"/\" form the sub-prefix, which indicates which registration agency within the International DOI Foundation (IDF) has rights to manage these handles. \"5240\" is assigned to the EIDR Association.\nXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-C is the DOI suffix. Each \"X\" denotes a hexadecimal digit (A-F), and \"C\" is an ISO 7064 Mod 37,36 check digit.There is also a 96-bit compact binary form that is intended for embedding in small payloads such as watermarks. This form is generated from the canonical format as follows:\n\n16-bit sub-prefix: generated by interpreting the sub-prefix as a binary value, e.g. B'0001010001111000'\n80-bit suffix: the non-checksum part of the suffix, represented as 10 bytesThe Uniform Resource Name form for an EIDR ID is specified in RFC 7302.\nFor use on the web an EIDR content ID can be represented as a URI in one of these forms:\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.5240/XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-C: this is an EIDR ID represented as a DOI proxy reference (it will be redirected from DOI to the EIDR registry)\ninfo:doi:10.5240/XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-C [deprecated]: this is an EIDR ID represented as an RFC 4452 compliant \"info\" URI (remembering that all EIDR IDs are also DOI IDs, but not the converse).\n\n\n=== Record types ===\nThere are four types of content records, each associated with a reserved prefix:\n\nContent ID (10.5240/XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-C): is associated with an entertainment asset such as a movie or TV series. Content records are hierarchical, allowing relationships to be expressed such as a Series, whose children would be Seasons, whose children in turn would be individual episodes. Many other relationships are supported, as described below. Content records form the bulk of the data in the EIDR registry.\nParty ID (10.5237/XXXX-XXXX): identifies entities such as registrants, content producers, and distributors.\nVideo Service ID (10.5239/XXXX-XXXX): Identifies a video service, colloquially known as a \"channel\" or \"network\": a (usually) linear sequence of content scheduled to be broadcast at specified times (e.g. the Service ID for the Cartoon Network is 10.5239/8BE5-E3F6). Video services are hierarchical: for example, a parent may have several children to account for regional or language variations).\nUser ID (10.5238/[0-9a-zA-Z_.#()]{2-32}): Identifies a user using a string of 2\u201332 alphanumeric and selected special characters (illustrated here with Perl syntax). A User is primarily an administrative concept that is subordinate to Parties (from whom they inherit access rights). Unlike the other EIDR DOIs, the User ID can only be used within EIDR (e.g. programming APIs).The sub-prefixes 5237, 5238, 5239, and 5240 are all assigned to the EIDR Association.\n\n\n=== Content Records ===\nContent records are objects categorized by their types and relationships. Each has three different (orthogonal) kinds of type:\n\nObject Type: there are a total of 10 of these. First is the Basic Type, which has the minimal fields necessary to describe a content record. The other 9 are derived from the basic type, and contain extra fields for describing more complex objects.\nStructural Type: these distinguish representations of a work and are listed in increasing order of specificity:\nAbstraction: Used for objects having no reality, such as a series container or the most basic concept of the original work. This corresponds to the International Standard Musical Work Code (ISWC) for musical works, the International Standard Text Code (ISTC) for textual works, or the International Standard Audiovisual Number (ISAN) for audiovisual works.\nPerformance: Used for items that are particular versions of a work, such as the original theatrical release or director's cut of a film or a locally censored version of a TV show. This roughly corresponds to the International Standard Recording Code (ISRC) for musical works and to some uses of the Version ISAN (V-ISAN) for audiovisual works.\nDigital: A particular digital representation of a work, such as an MPEG-2 encoding of a movie. This corresponds to some uses of the V-ISAN.\nReferent Type: the type of the content asset, independent of a particular manifestation (e.g. a movie shown on TV is still a movie):\nSeries: An Abstraction that contains ordered or unordered individual items.\nSeason: A second level of grouping below a Series, usually covering a time interval\nTV: Content that first appeared via broadcast.\nMovie: Long-form content that first appeared in a cinema or theater.\nShort: Loosely defined to cover a work that is 40 minutes or less, such as music videos, theatrical newsreels, or theatrical or DTV cartoon shorts.\nWeb: Content that first appeared on the Web. This is different from content from elsewhere that has been made available on the Web.\nInteractive Material: Content that is not strictly audio-visual. It covers DVD menus, interactive TV overlays, customized players, etc.\nCompilation: Content composed of multiple other assets that cannot be more precisely described, such as a box set of a film franchise.\nSupplemental: This type is for secondary content whose primary purpose is to support, augment, or promote other content. Examples include trailers, outtakes, and promotion documentaries (\"making of\" pieces).\n\n\n=== Basic metadata ===\nThe following fields (taken from a larger set) comprise the base object data of a content record:\n\nStructural Type: e.g. Abstraction\nMode: e.g. AudioVisual (for a movie or TV program); \"Audio\" for a radio program; \"Visual\" for a silent work.\nReferent Type: e.g. Movie\nTitle: the primary title. Titles and Alternate Titles are further distinguished by:\nLang: the language of the title expressed as ISO 639-1 code\nClass: release or regional\nAlternate Title 1..N: one or more alternate titles (often regional or language variants)\nOriginal Language: the language of the original release expressed as ISO 639-1 code\nAssociated Org 1..N: Party ID(s) of producer, studio, etc.\nRelease Date: date title was originally released\nCountry of Origin: ISO 3166-1 alpha 2 code, with extensions for defunct countries\nApproximate Length: expressed as XML Schema xs:duration datatype\nAlternate ID 1..N: one or more equivalent IDs expressed in a different asset ID system (see discussion below).\nCredits: only skeletal credits are provided, typically restricted to the director and up to four of the main actors. As noted, it is a non-goal for EIDR to compete with proprietary systems with rich metadata (e.g. plot summaries).  The main goal is to assist with disambiguating the title, and helping with validation and de-duplication efforts.\nRegistrant: the party that created this content record (e.g. \"10.5237/superparty\")\nCreation Date: date this content record was created\nStatus: normally \"valid\" (there are special cases for deleted records)\nLast Modification Date: last time this content record was changed\n\n\n=== Deleted content records ===\nAn EIDR ID must be always resolvable, thus under normal circumstances the corresponding Content Record will be permanent.  There are two mechanisms available to deal with errors or other unusual circumstances. The preferred one is aliasing, whereby an EIDR ID is transparently redirected to another content record. Aliasing is commonly employed to deal with an asset being registered twice.\nThe other mechanism is the use of tombstone records. This is employed when the Content Record is corrupted, or an otherwise invalid asset was accidentally registered. In this case the ID will be aliased to a special tombstone record. The tombstone can be recognized by applications because its EIDR ID field will be set to the distinguished value \"10.5240/0000-0000-0000-0000-0000-X\". Note that \"X\" means the 24th letter of the Latin alphabet (ASCII 0x58 or Unicode U+0058).\n\n\n=== Alternate ID ===\nHaving a rich set of alternate IDs for content is one of the primary goals of EIDR. This allows EIDR IDs to be used everywhere in content workflows; if an alternate ID is needed it can be found in the metadata for the EIDR ID. EIDR supports the inclusion both proprietary and other standard (e.g. ISAN) ID references. Additional Alternate IDs can be added when needed (e.g. by parties wanting to support new workflows). Below is an example of alternate IDs for the EIDR asset 10.5240/EA73-79D7-1B2B-B378-3A73-M (the movie Blade Runner). If an alternate ID is resolvable algorithmically, for example by placing it appropriately in a template URL, EIDR makes that link available.\n\nAlternate IDs are partitioned into non-proprietary and proprietary. The former have distinguished, predefined types (e.g. those issued by ISAN, IMDb, and IVA), whereas proprietary IDs are all of type \"Proprietary\", and are further distinguished by an associated DNS domain. As of July 2017, there are over 2 million alternate IDs directly available through EIDR.\n\n\n=== Relationships between objects ===\nContent objects can be related to each other according to the following table. These relations are expressed as additional fields in the content record and are thus relative to that object. Note that the subject object is the child and the target is the parent (e.g. subject is<relation-type>Of parent). Additional constraints are noted in the table.\n\n\n== Use in standards and applications ==\nEIDR has been incorporated into many standards. A few of the more significant ones are listed here:\n\nSMPTE/AMWA: SMPTE Recommended Practice RP 2079 standardizes use of EIDR in MXF media containers, at the heart of professional content workflows, including AMWA AS-03 and AS-11 specifications. SMTPE Recommended Practice 2021-5 allows an EIDR Identifier to be carried wherever BXF is used for exchange of data among broadcast systems.\nEuropean Broadcasting Union (EBU): EBUCore is a common core set of descriptive and technical metadata that describe media resources (audio, video, still images, subtitling, etc.). EBU and EIDR staff have produced a mapping of EBUCore for base records to EIDR root objects: .. EIDR and EBU are working together in the SMPTE Core working group to define descriptive metadata for SMPTE-based specifications and workflows. EIDR is one of the standards supported by the EBU Core.\nDVB: EIDR is referenced in draft DVB specifications for companion screens (tm-sm-css-0017r14).\nMPEG: EIDR has been proposed as a content identifier in the Multimedia Preservation Application Format that is being defined for archival use.\nCableLabs (US): EIDR is part of the CableLabs Metadata standard for the distribution of video on demand assets. EIDR is one program identifier that can be present in an SCTE-35 2013 segmentation descriptor, a standard used in IP distribution over cable. EIDR is also used in Dynamic Ad Insertion (DAI) products using the SCTE 130 standard architecture.\nEIDR and Alternate IDs: In order to promote interoperability of EIDR with a wide variety of systems, EIDR includes an \"AlternateID\" field to cross-reference existing IDs systems. Alternate IDs may include, for example, CRID (RFC 4078), ISAN, ISRC, UPC, or URI, as well as commercial ID systems such as Ad-ID, Baseline, IMDb, etc. Currently about half of EIDR records carry an ID from at least one other system.\nMapping from other Standard Metadata and Identifiers to EIDR: Other metadata and identifier systems can be directly mapped into EIDR:\nEN 15907 and EN 15744: These standards are under the auspices of the European Committee for Standardization CEN/TC 372 and filmstandards.org. Best practices and mappings are available for EN 15907 and EN 15744 root objects. EIDR is also working with film archives to extend interoperability with these standards to a more granular level of detail, including a project with the British Film Institute (BFI) to register their EN 15907-based records with EIDR.\nInternational Standard Audiovisual Number (ISAN): ISAN is widely used in rights management and collection systems. A complete mapping of an ISAN registration to an EIDR registration is available. The UK Audio-Visual Registration Agency, a joint venture between EIDR and ISAN-UK provides joint registration services for both identifiers. Precursors to this service have been used to obtain EIDR IDs and ISANs for broadcast content from ITV (a commercial TV network in the United Kingdom).EIDR identifiers have found their way into an increasing number of commercial applications. The following are illustrative of some of the advantages of using EIDR:\n\nWarner Brothers-Xbox integration: EIDR was used to improve the implementation of an Electronic Sell Through (EST) system for delivering Warner Theatrical titles to Microsoft Xbox Live customers. The operation of an electronic storefront requires several groups within Warner Brothers to coordinate their activities with the Xbox team. The outbound side of the distribution chain included publishing \"Avails\" (titles available for sale) and tracking order fulfillment; the inbound side included placing orders. Other functions such as reports spanned both sides of the distribution chain. The original system required manual intervention and supervision, particularly at boundaries between organizations. An example of the need for manual processing would be verifying that the correct version of an asset (which can vary depending on subtitles or content) was delivered. In the new system Warner Brothers created a new EIDR ID for each content variant, and these were used for all subsequent processing stages. This eliminated ambiguity and facilitated the automation of the inbound, outbound stages. Another advantage was the ability to create reports on the fly.\nSwisscom EPG integration: Swisscom operates a Pay TV service in Switzerland. In 2014 it completed the rollout of an Electronic Programming Guide (EPG) for its customers based on EIDR. This is an end-to-end system where EIDR IDs are used to represent the assets displayed in the EPG. A key element of the system was that EIDR IDs were also used in the guide metadata supplied to Swisscom by media-press.tv. This included setting up a system for assigning EIDR IDs to assets that were not already in the registry. A key advantage of using EIDR is not having to translate between different identifier systems.\n\n\n== Operations & Administrative ==\nEIDR is administered by the non-profit EIDR Association, which was founded in October 2010 by MovieLabs, CableLabs, Comcast and Rovi. Membership has grown steadily since then: as of late-2014 it has 79 members divided between the Industry Promoters and Industry Contributor levels. The fastest growing category is non-US companies, which now accounts for about 20% of membership.\nThe EIDR Association operates two EIDR registries: Production and Sandbox. The former is the official site, and the latter is reserved for test and development. Both systems are available publicly online, but the contents of the sandbox are not guaranteed to be correct, complete, or even to refer to assets that exist. Only members of the EIDR association may modify the registry.\n\n\n=== Registration ===\nRegistration of new assets can be done individually or in bulk (up to 100,000 assets at a time). In either case, the workflow comprises a combination of automated (to perform well-defined but tedious tasks) and manual (where human judgment is called for) processes. It is also iterative, as the initial matching process may identify a variety of gaps and errors that need to be dealt with.\nRegistering new assets is a complex process that requires some preparation, particularly in the case of bulk submission. The automated processes will check syntax, make sure that the basic metadata is supplied, and that any dependencies (e.g. series records created before constituent episodes) are honored. Manual steps include making sure the correct Parties are associated with the asset. One of the most important steps is ensuring that a new asset does not already exist in the registry: this is covered in the next section.\nIn order to register a new asset a user must be associated with a party that has been granted the \"Registrant\" role by the EIDR operator.  A registrant may be a principal agent, such as a studio or an encoding house, but it may also be a Party doing bulk registration of back-catalogue items, or a Party acting on behalf of someone else.  It is also a requirement that a registrant be an EIDR member. In general, content ownership, metadata authority, and registration capability are separate and unrelated concepts.\n\n\n=== Deduplication ===\nThis refers to flagging assets being submitted to the registry as falling into one of the following three categories:\n\nCandidate asset is unique (with respect to existing registry assets).\nCandidate asset is a duplicate of an existing record.\nCandidate asset has a high probability of being a duplicate.This assessment is based on applying a (large) set of rules to the candidate asset, which results a numerical score. Bucketing occurs as the result of comparing the score to two thresholds:\n\nLow Threshold: any asset with a score below this value is deemed not to be a duplicate. This is the only case when a proposed record addition or modification will succeed.\nHigh Threshold: any asset with a score above this value is deemed to (almost certainly) be a duplicate. The proposed record addition/modification will not proceed, and an error status will be returned. Registrants will generally use the pre-existing ID for the item they tried to register, and can add missing information and Alternate IDs to the existing record.Assets falling between the low and high threshold are deemed to have a high possibility of being a duplicate: the proposed record addition/modification will not proceed until manually reviewed by EIDR operations staff.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\nThe components of the EIDR system are shown below.\n\nThe principal functional blocks are as follows:\n\nCore Registry: This module is a customization and configuration of the CNRI Digital Object Repository. It performs various functions including registration, generation of unique identifiers, indexing, object storage management, and access control.\nRepository: This stores and provides access to registered objects; for EIDR, these objects are collections of metadata, not the media assets themselves. The metadata includes standard object information, relationships, and access control settings.\nREST API: A REST interface that provides access to the full set of non-administrative registry features. Services can make individual or batched calls, which can be dispatched synchronously or asynchronously. A general query syntax enables the retrieval (and in some cases modification) of registry records satisfying a set of criteria specified by the caller.\nEIDR SDK: this is provided to developers to facilitate the creation of third party applications (usually in support of a B2B or intramural workflow). It comprises a Java SDK, a .NET SDK, and sample programs built upon the two SDKs. Using the SDK is recommended over direct calls to the REST API.\nCommand Line Tools: these are simple Java and .NET applications, built on the SDK, each of which provides a single function, such as resolve, query, match, and register.\nWeb UI: a Web-based user interface primarily for search, lookup, and browsing the object hierarchy. It also supports simple registrations.\nDOI Proxy: Using the handle prefix, this forwards EIDR DOI resolution requests to the EIDR registry.\nHandle System: Provides distributed lookup and resolution services\n\n\n=== Relation to DOI and Handle System ===\nAn EIDR ID is a specialized example of a Digital Object Identifier (DOI), which in turn is built on top of the Handle System developed by the Corporation for National Research Initiatives (CNRI). The EIDR-specific aspects of the lower layers are described in more detail below.\n\n\n=== Digital Object Identifier (EIDR Aspects) ===\nA Digital Object Identifier, standardized as ISO 26324, seeks to uniquely identify a wide range of digital artifacts including books, recordings, research data, and other digital content. The goal is not just for the IDs to be unique, but persistent and immutable. As opposed to URLs, DOI identifiers stay the same even if the objects move to another location, or become owned by another organization. Here are some of the characteristics of DOI:\n\nThe International DOI Foundation (IDF) enforces previously agreed rules on the constituent Registration Agencies (e.g. EIDR) to ensure continuity. In particular, if an RA ceases operation, the names it hosts will be taken over by another RA.\nThe IDF defines rules to which all DOI names must adhere (what kinds of object may be named by a specific RA)\nThe DOI system provides a data model, based on a data dictionary, to enable a structured means of expressing metadata (and inter-object relationships).\nThe DOI system has its own highly redundant and distributed set of handle and proxy servers.\nAll DOI prefixes are of the form \"10.NNNN\" where 10 is a directory indicator and \"NNNN\" is a registrant code in the range 1-65535 (e.g. EIDR content records use is 10.5240)The DOI data model provides the means to associate metadata with each object, as well as policies governing its use. In the words of the DOI Handbook, metadata may include \"names, identifiers, descriptions, types, classifications, locations, times, measurements, relationships and any other kind of information related to [an object].\" Metadata flows between the following entities:\n\nResource Provider: usually the owner of media asset, which is responsible for inputting metadata to the system.\nRegistration Agency: the entities that serves as the repository of the assets (and associated metadata). As noted DOI supports a federation of independent RA's, each responsible for a set of assets. EIDR is one such RA. Others include CrossRef for scholarly articles, DataCite for research data, and OPOCE for official publications of the European Union.\nService User: the entities making queries to RA's retrieve metadata associated with assets. The DOI resolution framework is responsible for dispatching a query to the appropriate RA (the Service User doesn't need to know this).To foster interoperability between RAs, DOI has the concept of a metadata Kernel. This is a core set of metadata that all objects stored within the DOI framework should have. The full set may be found in the DOI handbook. Interoperability is a large topic extending beyond the scope of EIDR, but the following subset is particularly relevant to EIDR assets:\n\nreferent: an object maintained in the DOI system.\nreferentName: the name of the referent (e.g. the title of a movie)\nprimaryReferentType: For EIDR, this includes creation (e.g. entertainment assets) and party (e.g. the creator thereof).\nstructuralType: these are mutually exclusive categories that identify the form of an asset. Two particularly relevant to EIDR assets are an abstraction (an object such as a movie that may exist in multiple forms) and performance (a specific instance of an object such as Director's Cut).\nprincipalAgent: for creations, the entity principally responsible for its existence.\nregistrationAuthorityCode: denotes the agency that issued the DOI. This would be the EIDR RA for EIDR assets.EIDR metadata is available in standard DOI kernel metadata format as well as EIDR-specific formats. The DOI for the DOI metadata schema is doi:10.1000/276 .\n\n\n=== Handle System (EIDR Aspects) ===\nDOI is in turn implemented on top of the Handle System, a distributed, highly scalable, name resolution service. A handle is defined as:\n\n<Handle> ::= <Handle Naming Authority> \"/\" <Handle Local Name>The Naming Authority is globally unique and defines both an administrative space and the syntax of the Handle Local Name. For EIDR in the definition above, the \"10.5240\" is the EIDR Naming Authority, and is responsible for resolving the suffix (including that it conforms to the expected syntax for an EIDR asset). The range of allowable Naming Authorities is more general than is employed by DOI (or EIDR).\nThe distributed nature of the Handle System allows each local namespace to be hosted on multiple geographically distributed service sites. This is a federated model where each local name space has complete control over the placement and operation of its service sites. Furthermore, each service site may contain multiple resolution servers: requests directed to a particular service site will be dispatched evenly across its constituent servers.\nThe data model of the Handle System is simple but flexible. An arbitrary number of values may be associated with each handle. Over time, these values may be created, modified, and destroyed. Each such datum has the following attributes:\n\nindex: an unsigned integer that identifies a data value from the others that may exist for this handle.\ntype: a UTF-8 string identifying the type. The type system is extensible and common types are maintained as handles in the \"0.TYPE\" naming authority. There are no restrictions on the creation of new types, although using resolvable handles as type names is recommended best practice. Common types include URL for a single of indirection, \"10320/loc\" for a set of context-based resolution alternatives, and various administrative types for Handle System management, all of which are based on handle resolution.\ndata: the value itself, represented as a sequence of octets which are interpreted in the context of the associated type\npermission: access rights to this particular value. Note that different data values of a handle may have different permissions\nTTL: an integer that specifies how long a value may be cached\ntimestamp: an integer (expressed as milliseconds from the Unix epoch) that records the last time the value was updated\nreference: a list of references to other handle values. These are usually used to add credentials (e.g. a digital signature).Accessing the Handle System is done via a wire protocol defined in RFC 3652; EIDR applications don't have to be concerned with this because of the layering of protocols.\n\n\n== See also ==\nAuthority control\nWikidata Property:P2704\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nR.

It is a dynamically typed, concatenative programming language. It was created at Adobe Systems by John Warnock, Charles Geschke, Doug Brotz, Ed Taft and Bill Paxton from 1982 to 1984.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe concepts of the PostScript language were seeded in 1976 by John Gaffney at Evans & Sutherland, a computer graphics company. At that time Gaffney and John Warnock were developing an interpreter for a large three-dimensional graphics database of New York Harbor.\nConcurrently, researchers at Xerox PARC had developed the first laser printer and had recognized the need for a standard means of defining page images. In 1975-76 Bob Sproull and William Newman developed the Press format, which was eventually used in the Xerox Star system to drive laser printers. But Press, a data format rather than a language, lacked flexibility, and PARC mounted the Interpress effort to create a successor.\nIn 1978 John Gaffney and Martin Newell then at Xerox PARC wrote J & M or JaM (for \"John and Martin\") which was used for VLSI design and the investigation of type and graphics printing. This work later evolved and expanded into the Interpress language.\nWarnock left with Chuck Geschke and founded Adobe Systems in December 1982. They, together with Doug Brotz, Ed Taft and Bill Paxton created a simpler language, similar to Interpress, called PostScript, which went on the market in 1984. At about this time they were visited by Steve Jobs, who urged them to adapt PostScript to be used as the language for driving laser printers.\nIn March 1985, the Apple LaserWriter was the first printer to ship with PostScript, sparking the desktop publishing (DTP) revolution in the mid-1980s. The combination of technical merits and widespread availability made PostScript a language of choice for graphical output for printing applications. For a time an interpreter (sometimes referred to as a RIP for Raster Image Processor) for the PostScript language was a common component of laser printers, into the 1990s.\nHowever, the cost of implementation was high; computers output raw PS code that would be interpreted by the printer into a raster image at the printer's natural resolution. This required high performance microprocessors and ample memory. The LaserWriter used a 12 MHz Motorola 68000, making it faster than any of the Macintosh computers to which it attached. When the laser printer engines themselves cost over a thousand dollars the added cost of PS was marginal.  But as printer mechanisms fell in price, the cost of implementing PS became too great a fraction of overall printer cost; in addition, with desktop computers becoming more powerful, it no longer made sense to offload the rasterization work onto the resource-constrained printer. By 2001, few lower-end printer models came with support for PostScript, largely due to growing competition from much cheaper non-PostScript ink jet printers, and new software-based methods to render PostScript images on the computer, making them suitable for any printer; PDF, a descendant of PostScript, provides one such method, and has largely replaced PostScript as de facto standard for electronic document distribution.\nOn high-end printers, PostScript processors remain common, and their use can dramatically reduce the CPU work involved in printing documents, transferring the work of rendering PostScript images from the computer to the printer.\n\n\n=== PostScript Level 1 ===\nThe first version of the PostScript language was released to the market in 1984. The suffix Level 1 was added when Level 2 was introduced.\n\n\n=== PostScript Level 2 ===\nPostScript Level 2 was introduced in 1991, and included several improvements: improved speed and reliability, support for in-Raster Image Processing (RIP) separations, image decompression (for example, JPEG images could be rendered by a PostScript program), support for composite fonts, and the form mechanism for caching reusable content.\n\n\n=== PostScript 3 ===\nPostScript 3 (Adobe dropped the \"level\" terminology in favor of simple versioning) came at the end of 1997, and along with many new dictionary-based versions of older operators, introduced better color handling and new filters (which allow in-program compression/decompression, program chunking, and advanced error-handling).\nPostScript 3 was significant in terms of replacing the existing proprietary color electronic prepress systems, then widely used for magazine production, through the introduction of smooth shading operations with up to 4096 shades of grey (rather than the 256 available in PostScript Level 2), as well as DeviceN, a color space that allowed the addition of additional ink colors (called spot colors) into composite color pages.\n\n\n== Use in printing ==\n\n\n=== Before PostScript ===\nPrior to the introduction of PostScript, printers were designed to print character output given the text\u2014typically in ASCII\u2014as input. There were a number of technologies for this task, but most shared the property that the glyphs were physically difficult to change, as they were stamped onto typewriter keys, bands of metal, or optical plates.\nThis changed to some degree with the increasing popularity of dot matrix printers. The characters on these systems were drawn as a series of dots, as defined by a font table inside the printer. As they grew in sophistication, dot matrix printers started including several built-in fonts from which the user could select, and some models allowed users to upload their own custom glyphs into the printer.\nDot matrix printers also introduced the ability to print raster graphics. The graphics were interpreted by the computer and sent as a series of dots to the printer using a series of escape sequences. These printer control languages varied from printer to printer, requiring program authors to create numerous drivers.\nVector graphics printing was left to special-purpose devices, called plotters. Almost all plotters shared a common command language, HPGL, but were of limited use for anything other than printing graphics. In addition, they tended to be expensive and slow, and thus rare.\n\n\n=== PostScript printing ===\nLaser printers combine the best features of both printers and plotters. Like plotters, laser printers offer high quality line art, and like dot-matrix printers, they are able to generate pages of text and raster graphics.  Unlike either printers or plotters, a laser printer makes it possible to position high-quality graphics and text on the same page.  PostScript made it possible to exploit fully these characteristics by offering a single control language that could be used on any brand of printer.\nPostScript went beyond the typical printer control language and was a complete programming language of its own. Many applications can transform a document into a PostScript program: the execution of which results in the original document. This program can be sent to an interpreter in a printer, which results in a printed document, or to one inside another application, which will display the document on-screen. Since the document-program is the same regardless of its destination, it is called device-independent.\nPostScript is noteworthy for implementing 'on-the fly' rasterization in which everything, even text, is specified in terms of straight lines and cubic B\u00e9zier curves (previously found only in CAD applications), which allows arbitrary scaling, rotating and other transformations. When the PostScript program is interpreted, the interpreter converts these instructions into the dots needed to form the output. For this reason, PostScript interpreters are occasionally called PostScript raster image processors, or RIPs.\n\n\n=== Font handling ===\n\nAlmost as complex as PostScript itself is its handling of fonts. The font system uses the PS graphics primitives to draw glyphs as curves, which can then be rendered at any resolution. A number of typographic issues had to be considered with this approach.\nOne issue is that fonts do not scale linearly at small sizes and features of the glyphs will become proportionally too large or small and start to look displeasing. PostScript avoided this problem with the inclusion of font hinting, in which additional information is provided in horizontal or vertical bands to help identify the features in each letter that are important for the rasterizer to maintain. The result was significantly better-looking fonts even at low resolution. It had formerly been believed that hand-tuned bitmap fonts were required for this task.\nAt the time, the technology for including these hints in fonts was carefully guarded, and the hinted fonts were compressed and encrypted into what Adobe called a Type 1 Font (also known as PostScript Type 1 Font, PS1, T1 or Adobe Type 1). Type 1 was effectively a simplification of the PS system to store outline information only, as opposed to being a complete language (PDF is similar in this regard). Adobe would then sell licenses to the Type 1 technology to those wanting to add hints to their own fonts. Those who did not license the technology were left with the Type 3 Font (also known as PostScript Type 3 Font, PS3 or T3). Type 3 fonts allowed for all the sophistication of the PostScript language, but without the standardized approach to hinting.\nThe Type 2 font format was designed to be used with Compact Font Format (CFF) charstrings, and was implemented to reduce the overall font file size. The CFF/Type2 format later became the basis for handling PostScript outlines in OpenType fonts.\nThe CID-keyed font format was also designed, to solve the problems in the OCF/Type 0 fonts, for addressing the complex Asian-language (CJK) encoding and very large character set issues. The CID-keyed font format can be used with the Type 1 font format for standard CID-keyed fonts, or Type 2 for CID-keyed OpenType fonts.\nTo compete with Adobe's system, Apple designed their own system, TrueType, around 1991. Immediately following the announcement of TrueType, Adobe published the specification for the Type 1 font format. Retail tools such as Altsys Fontographer (acquired by Macromedia in January 1995, owned by FontLab since May 2005) added the ability to create Type 1 fonts. Since then, many free Type 1 fonts have been released; for instance, the fonts used with the TeX typesetting system are available in this format.\nIn the early 1990s there were several other systems for storing outline-based fonts, developed by Bitstream and Metafont for instance, but none included a general-purpose printing solution and they were therefore not widely used.\nIn the late 1990s, Adobe joined Microsoft in developing OpenType, essentially a functional superset of the Type 1 and TrueType formats. When printed to a PostScript output device, the unneeded parts of the OpenType font are omitted, and what is sent to the device by the driver is the same as it would be for a TrueType or Type 1 font, depending on which kind of outlines were present in the OpenType font.\n\n\n=== Other implementations ===\nIn the 1980s, Adobe drew most of its revenue from the licensing fees for their implementation of PostScript for printers, known as a raster image processor or RIP.  As a number of new RISC-based platforms became available in the mid-1980s, some found Adobe's support of the new machines to be lacking.\nThis and issues of cost led to third-party implementations of PostScript becoming common, particularly in low-cost printers (where the licensing fee was the sticking point) or in high-end typesetting equipment (where the quest for speed demanded support for new platforms faster than Adobe could provide). At one point,  Microsoft licensed to Apple a PostScript-compatible interpreter it had bought called TrueImage, and Apple licensed to Microsoft its new font format, TrueType.  Apple ended up reaching an accord with Adobe and licensed genuine PostScript for its printers, but TrueType became the standard outline font technology for both Windows and the Macintosh.\nToday, third-party PostScript-compatible interpreters are widely used in printers and multifunction peripherals (MFPs).  For example, CSR plc's IPS PS3 interpreter, formerly known as PhoenixPage, is standard in many printers and MFPs, including those developed by Hewlett-Packard and sold under the LaserJet and Color LaserJet lines.  Other third-party PostScript solutions used by print and MFP manufacturers include Jaws and the Harlequin RIP, both by Global Graphics.  A free software version, with several other applications, is Ghostscript.  Several compatible interpreters are listed on the Undocumented Printing Wiki.Some basic, inexpensive laser printers do not support PostScript, instead coming with drivers that simply rasterize the platform's native graphics formats rather than converting them to PostScript first.  When PostScript support is needed for such a printer, Ghostscript can be used. There are also a number of commercial PostScript interpreters, such as TeleType Co.'s T-Script.\n\n\n== Use as a display system ==\n\nPostScript became commercially successful due to the introduction of the graphical user interface (GUI), allowing designers to directly lay out pages for eventual output on laser printers. However, the GUI's own graphics systems were generally much less sophisticated than PostScript; Apple's QuickDraw, for instance, supported only basic lines and arcs, not the complex B-splines and advanced region filling options of PostScript. In order to take full advantage of PostScript printing, applications on the computers had to re-implement those features using the host platform's own graphics system. This led to numerous issues where the on-screen layout would not exactly match the printed output, due to differences in the implementation of these features.\nAs computer power grew, it became possible to host the PS system in the computer rather than the printer. This led to the natural evolution of PS from a printing system to one that could also be used as the host's own graphics language. There were numerous advantages to this approach; not only did it help eliminate the possibility of different output on screen and printer, but it also provided a powerful graphics system for the computer, and allowed the printers to be \"dumb\" at a time when the cost of the laser engines was falling. In a production setting, using PostScript as a display system meant that the host computer could render low-resolution to the screen, higher resolution to the printer, or simply send the PS code to a smart printer for offboard printing.\nHowever, PostScript was written with printing in mind, and had numerous features that made it unsuitable for direct use in an interactive display system. In particular, PS was based on the idea of collecting up PS commands until the showpage command was seen, at which point all of the commands read up to that point were interpreted and output. In an interactive system this was clearly not appropriate. Nor did PS have any sort of interactivity built in; for example, supporting hit detection for mouse interactivity obviously did not apply when PS was being used on a printer.\nWhen Steve Jobs left Apple and started NeXT, he pitched Adobe on the idea of using PS as the display system for his new workstation computers. The result was Display PostScript, or DPS. DPS added basic functionality to improve performance by changing many string lookups into 32 bit integers, adding support for direct output with every command, and adding functions to allow the GUI to inspect the diagram. Additionally, a set of \"bindings\" was provided to allow PS code to be called directly from the C programming language. NeXT used these bindings in their NeXTStep system to provide an object oriented graphics system. Although DPS was written in conjunction with NeXT, Adobe sold it commercially and it was a common feature of most Unix workstations in the 1990s.\nSun Microsystems took another approach, creating NeWS. Instead of DPS's concept of allowing PS to interact with C programs, NeWS instead extended PS into a language suitable for running the entire GUI of a computer. Sun added a number of new commands for timers, mouse control, interrupts and other systems needed for interactivity, and added data structures and language elements to allow it to be completely object oriented internally. A complete GUI, three in fact, were written in NeWS and provided for a time on their workstations. However, the ongoing efforts to standardize the X11 system led to its introduction and widespread use on Sun systems, and NeWS never became widely used.\n\n\n== The language ==\nPostScript is a Turing-complete programming language, belonging to the concatenative group. Typically, PostScript programs are not produced by humans, but by other programs. However, it is possible to write computer programs in PostScript just like any other programming language.PostScript is an interpreted, stack-based language similar to Forth but with strong dynamic typing, data structures inspired by those found in Lisp, scoped memory and, since language level 2, garbage collection. The language syntax uses reverse Polish notation, which makes the order of operations unambiguous, but reading a program requires some practice, because one has to keep the layout of the stack in mind. Most operators (what other languages term functions) take their arguments from the stack, and place their results onto the stack. Literals (for example, numbers) have the effect of placing a copy of themselves on the stack. Sophisticated data structures can be built on the array and dictionary types, but cannot be declared to the type system, which sees them all only as arrays and dictionaries, so any further typing discipline to be applied to such user-defined \"types\" is left to the code that implements them.\nThe character \"%\" is used to introduce comments in PostScript programs. As a general convention, every PostScript program should start with the characters \"%!PS\" as an interpreter directive so that all devices will properly interpret it as PostScript.\n\n\n=== \"Hello world\" ===\nA Hello World program, the customary way to show a small example of a complete program in a given language, might look like this in PostScript (level 2):\n\nor if the output device has a console\n\n\n=== Units of length ===\nPostScript uses the point as its unit of length. However, unlike some of the other versions of the point, PostScript uses exactly 72 points to the inch. Thus:\n\n1 point = 1/72 inch = 25.4/72 mm = 127/360 mm = 352.777\u2026  micrometersFor example, in order to draw a vertical line of 4 cm length, it is sufficient to type:\n\n0 0 moveto \n0 113.385827 lineto stroke\n\nMore readably and idiomatically, one might use the following equivalent, which demonstrates a simple procedure definition and the use of the mathematical operators mul and div:\n\nMost implementations of PostScript use single-precision reals (24-bit mantissa), so it is not meaningful to use more than 9 decimal digits to specify a real number, and performing calculations may produce unacceptable round-off errors.\n\n\n== Software ==\nList of software which can be used to render the PostScript documents:\n\nGhostscript\npstoedit\nZathura\n\n\n== See also ==\nAdobe StandardEncoding (PostScript character set)\nDocument Structuring Conventions\nTypeface\nComputer font\nEncapsulated PostScript\nPostScript Printer Description (PPD)\nPrinter Command Language (PCL)\nLaTeX\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nAdobe Systems Incorporated (February 1999) [1985].

The series primarily focuses upon the maintenance and repair of automotive vehicles, covering a wide range of makes and models (300 models of car and 130 models of motorcycle); the manuals are aimed mainly at DIY enthusiasts rather than professional garage mechanics, as they lack the depth of coverage on particular vehicles or problems. The series includes a range of 'practical lifestyle' manuals in the same style for a range of topics, including domestic appliances and personal computers, digital photography, model railways, sport, animal care, men,\nbabies,\nsex, and women. They also now publish the Bluffer's Guides collection.Additionally, Haynes have released manuals based on popular fictional series including Star Trek and Thomas and Friends.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Haynes manuals are named after John Harold Haynes (1938\u20132019) OBE. In 1956, when he was at school, he wrote and published a book on building a 'special' based on the Austin 7, and wrote two further books while performing national service in the Royal Air Force. J. H. Haynes & Co. Limited was founded on 18 May 1960 and the first manual actually entitled \"Haynes Owners Workshop Manual\", for the Austin-Healey Sprite, was published in 1965. Haynes was made an Officer of Order of the British Empire in the Queen's Birthday Honours List 1995 for services to publishing.  He died on 8 February 2019, aged 80.Many Haynes Manuals bear a cover illustration of a cutaway view technical drawing of the vehicle, hand-drawn by Terry Davey, and they bear his signature. Haynes also publishes a range of Chilton manuals under license from Cengage.In 2013, Haynes acquired Clymer repair manuals from Penton Media. In 2020, Haynes was acquired by Infopro Digital, a technical data company owned by TowerBrook Capital Partners, for \u00a3114.5 million.\n\n\n== Stripdown and rebuild ==\nThe automotive vehicle manuals are based upon taking apart and putting together a vehicle. The cover of each manual states: \"based on a complete strip-down and rebuild\". Each section has step-by-step instructions with diagrams and photographs of an actual strip-down or rebuild.\n\n\n== For professionals ==\nManuals for garage professionals include books such as the Automotive Diesel Engine Service Guide, the Automotive Air Conditioning TechBook, Citro\u00ebn and Peugeot Engine Management Systems, and two Engine Management and Fuel Injection Systems Pin Tables and Wiring Diagrams TechBook volumes.\n\n\n== Distribution ==\nHaynes manuals are published in 15 languages: English (including British, American and Australian variants), French, Swedish, Chinese, Japanese, German, Czech, Finnish, Polish, Bulgarian, Hebrew, Greek, Danish, Spanish (including American Spanish versions), and Russian.\n\n\n== Location ==\nThe company is based in Sparkford, a village near Yeovil in Somerset, England. The Haynes International Motor Museum, is also in Sparkford and it is home to a large collection of both classic and modern cars, and many rarities.\n\n\n== Authorship ==\nHaynes manuals are written by a pair of authors, a process which takes between 20 and 30 weeks.  The car or motorcycle is bought at the beginning of the project and sold at the end.Although the workshop phase of the project usually lasts for roughly four weeks, the vehicle is usually retained for a couple of months to ensure it is functioning correctly.\n\n\n== Manufacturers ==\nHaynes generally has the co-operation of the manufacturers to provide technical information such as mechanical tolerances and wiring diagrams. Haynes claims this provides customers with information that lets them fix their vehicle, to their ability, or at least diagnose the fault before taking it to a garage.Over the lifetime of a vehicle, the aftermarket is worth perhaps as much as the new cost price of the vehicle, so the manufacturer still gets a significant revenue from the spare parts, so the longer a vehicle lasts, the more spare parts and servicing can be sold to the owner.\n\n\n== Fictional vehicles ==\nHaynes also publishes manuals for fictional vehicles, such as the USS Enterprise (NCC-1701) from Star Trek and the Ecto-1 from Ghostbusters.\n\n\n== See also ==\nChilton Company\nClymer repair manual\nHow-to\nG.
